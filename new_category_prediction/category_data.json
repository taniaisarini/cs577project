{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 After a year spent off-air, the Golden Globe Awards are returning to NBC in January, when the embattled Hollywood Foreign Press Association will seek a primetime comeback.NBC, the Hollywood Press Association and dick clark productions on Tuesday made the Globes\u2019 return official. The 80th Golden Globes will be held January 10, airing both on NBC and Peacock.For the past year and half, Hollywood has effectively boycotted the Globes, for years one of the most-watched award shows after the Academy Awards. But after the Los Angeles Times reported ahead of the 2021 broadcast that the HFPA\u2019s 87 members of non-American journalists included no Black members, studios, publicists and stars said they would cease participating in the Globes. Tom Cruise returned his three Golden Globe awards.Since then, the HFPA has reorganized itself, revamped its membership and enacted reforms designed to curtail the kinds of unethical behavior the group has long been criticized for. The HFPA added new members, including six Black voting members, and recently added 103 international, nonmember voters. The HFPA on Tuesday said their voting body is now 52% female, 19.5% Latino, 12% Asian, 10% Black and 10% Middle Eastern.\u201cWe recognize the HFPA\u2019s commitment to ongoing change and look forward to welcoming back the Golden Globes to NBC for its landmark 80th Anniversary in January 2023,\u201d said Frances Berwick, chairman of entertainment networks for NBCUniversal.NBC had reason to want to get the Globes back on the air. In 2018, the network signed an eight-year deal to continue airing the awards through 2026. Citing the HFPA\u2019s ongoing reforms, NBC elected not to televise the previous Golden Globes in January. The organization went ahead announcing awards, anyway, in an untelevised and little-noticed gathering unattended by nominees.This year\u2019s ceremony, the organizations said, will be broadcast in a one-year agreement. Terms were unavailable but the deal is expected to be less than the approximately $60 million the network previously paid annually to air the Globes. With backlash swirling and the ceremony scaled down because of the pandemic, the 2021 Globes were watched by 6.9 million people, according to Nielsen, down from more than 18 million the year before.Whether NBC\u2019s endorsement will be enough to return the Globes to Hollywood\u2019s good graces, however, remains to be seen. Nominations to the Globes will be announced Dec. 12.The HFPA is currently being run by interim Chief Executive Todd Boehly, whose investment firm, Eldridge Industries, bought the Globes and turned it from a nonprofit into a for-profit venture. Boehly\u2019s firm is also the parent company of dick clark productions, the awards\u2019 producer, and the owner of the Globes\u2019 longtime home, the Beverly Hilton.___Follow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAPBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Politics Reporter, HuffPostSILVER SPRING, Md. \u2014 For some, it\u2019s hearing air raid sirens while talking with relatives back in Ukraine. For others, it\u2019s the fear that Ukraine may become an economic basket case, even if it wins the war. Or that the world may forget the country\u2019s plight altogether.Ukrainans, their friends and those simply curious about the country that\u2019s fought Russia to standstill gathered on a sun-splashed weekend at St. Andrew Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral in suburban Washington for the region\u2019s biggest annual Ukrainian cultural festival.Amid women wearing garlands in their hair, men wearing vyshyvanka \u2014 white shirts with intricately patterned embroidery down the front \u2014 and accompanied by traditional and pop Ukrainian music, the war was never far from people\u2019s minds. What in past years had been a chance to showcase the culture and drink some beers from the home country had taken on a different, somewhat deeper meaning.\u201cThis year is particularly beautiful and sad at the same time,\u201d said the church pastor, the Rev. Volodymr Steliac, as he formally opened the festival Saturday. \u201cWe have seen the worst of humanity but at the same time we have seen the best of humanity.\u201d The festival opened on Day 206 of the invasion and came amid good news for Ukraine: a surprise counteroffensive in the northeast that in a few days cleared Russians from towns and villages they had fought weeks to take earlier in the war.But the victory came with a price. In the strategic town of Izium, mass graves were found, similar to those seen in the capital Kyiv\u2019s suburb of Bucha when the war began.\u201cWe have seen the worst of humanity but at the same time we have seen the best of humanity.\u201dOksana Sukhina, who was staffing the booth of the U.S. Ukraine Foundation, where she is project director, said she wanted to see what the impact of the latest reports of atrocities will be on Europe.In the past, she said, some people suspected Ukrainians have exaggerated the cruelty of the Russians with reports of horrific claims like rape as a weapon of war and the theft of household goods then shipped to Russia.\u201cThen you see Bucha, you see now Izyum. And we have yet to see Kherson and Mariupol and other places,\u201d Sukhina said.Sukhina, 50, immigrated to the U.S. from Kyiv in 2020. Warned by former colleagues in the State Department about the likelihood of invasion, her parents arrived in Washington only days before the war.But as the prospect of Kyiv\u2019s being captured receded, they went back, as did one of her daughters. They joined a 23-year-old son who left his IT job in Chicago in March to help deliver food and medical supplies in Kyiv.Sukhina said she tried to convince him to stay, but could not forbid him to leave because she had participated in pro-democracy protests in 2004 and 2014.\u201cI\u2019m proud of them. They are trying to do whatever they can. And this is what makes us win,\u201d she said.Steliac said the church was open 24-7 when the war began. He was only getting two or three hours of sleep a night as volunteers dropped off humanitarian aid, organized it and shipped it to Ukraine.In one 48-hour period, he said, two of those young volunteers lost their fathers back in Ukraine.\u201cThe war is not there alone; the war is here as well,\u201d Steliac said. Even though the process of gathering and sending aid has become more routine, even keeping in touch with family back home, he said, can be painful.\u201cWhat was traumatic was that they were communicating with their relatives and they said, \u2018Oh, a bomb fell just a couple of neighborhoods over\u2019 and then they tried to connect again and the phone connection doesn\u2019t go through,\u201d Steliac said.\u201cYou think of the worst.\u201dAlex Naumovych, a 36-year old mortgage loan officer from Ternopil in the western part of Ukraine, said he\u2019s had calls interrupted by the air raid sirens, although now he said the alarms are likely to be ignored.Ternopil, a city of about 250,000, has no military targets, but he said his parents still hear the sirens daily. Ukraine tracks incoming missiles and activates local warning systems based on where they could potentially land, so even residents of cities not targeted are warned.\u201cI\u2019m worried that, sooner or later, one of those missiles may hit my city, like my parents\u2019 place,\u201d Naumovych said.Naumovych arrived in the U.S. almost 11 years ago. He had about $440 to his name then, he said, and started a landscaping business he sold years later for more than $1 million.\u201cI\u2019m worried that, sooner or later, one of those missiles may hit my city, like my parents\u2019 place.\u201d\u201cI love this country. Like you can come with $400 and six, seven years later you can be a millionaire,\u201d he said.One of his big worries for Ukraine now is its economy, with so many people out of work because of the war and inflation projected to hit 30%.\u201cThe economy is in bad shape,\u201d Naumovych said. \u201cA lot of people left Ukraine and I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re coming back\u201dThe parents of software engineer Serhiy Vorobiov, 43, are near the war\u2019s front line in Zaporizhzhya, a Russian-speaking region that includes Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant. Russia has captured the plant and Ukrainians and others fear they will use it for blackmail.But Vorobiov said his parents, only 25 miles from the front lines in the city of Zaporizhzhya, still think everything is relatively safe. He said he chats with them with about the same frequency as before the war.\u201cMaybe because there is no very high emergency at this point. I know it\u2019s not to my defense, but that\u2019s how it is,\u201d he said.Vorobiov, his wife Oksana, 33, and their three young children, Yaromyr, Myroslava and Oksana, have lived in the U.S. since 2020. He said the war has reinforced his belief in getting rid of any Russian influence on their upbringing.\u201cI always dreamed of it, I just didn\u2019t want to be very tough in that. But now I have all the rights and I want to use it,\u201d Vorobiov said.\u201cI want them to forget [the] Russian language. We are from [the] Russian-speaking part of Ukraine, but now we are fixing it, as much as we can. Forget Russian, forget we were ever together, [forget] Soviet Union. I\u2019m happy they don\u2019t know what Soviet Union is.\u201d But in her remarks to open the festivities, Oksana Markarova, the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, advised focusing on the present, not the past.\u201cPlease be joyful today,\u201d she counseled.She said Russian leader Vladimir Putin and the Russians want Ukrainians to \u201csit down and cry\u201d at the devastation.\u201cThis is what Russians want us to do. And we will not give it to them.\u201dPolitics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Trends Reporter\u201cBlade Runner\u201d is about to get the limited series treatment \u2014 and Ridley Scott is producing it himself.Amazon Prime Video has officially greenlighted a sequel series in the sci-fi franchise, The Hollywood Reporter said Thursday. Scott, who directed the initial 1982 film, will executive produce the show alongside \u201cShining Girls\u201d writer Silka Luisa and Michael Green, who co-wrote the recent follow-up \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d\u201cThe original Blade Runner ... is considered one of the greatest and most influential science-fiction movies of all time, and we\u2019re excited to introduce Blade Runner 2099 to our global Prime Video customers,\u201d Vernon Sanders, Amazon\u2019s head of global television, told the outlet.While Amazon had already said it was developing the series in February, Thursday\u2019s confirmation yielded new details about the project \u2014 which will take place 50 years after the 2017 sequel film that starred Ryan Gosling and brought original lead Harrison Ford back into the fold.1982\u2032s \u201cBlade Runner,\u201d based on a novel by Philip K.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Afghan Fellow, HuffPostSenior Reporter, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2014 A new bipartisan bill to give Afghans in America a pathway to permanent residency stands a slim chance of winning enough Republican support to become law in the near future.The U.S. brought in tens of thousands of people as part of its hasty retreat from Afghanistan last year but has not said that they can stay. The Afghan Adjustment Act, introduced in August by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) with three Republican co-sponsors, would create a path to permanent residency for more than 77,000 Afghans who have arrived in the U.S. since last summer. \u201cGiving our Afghan allies \u2013 many of whom worked alongside our U.S. Military \u2013 a chance to apply for permanent legal status is the right and necessary thing to do,\u201d Klobuchar told HuffPost in a statement. \u201cThis bipartisan legislation will provide Afghans who submit to additional vetting a green card to live and work in the United States.\u201dThe bill would also expand eligibility for so-called special immigrant visas to other at-risk groups still in Afghanistan, such as certain former members of the Afghan armed forces.\u201cThese people have no place to go,\u201d bill co-sponsor Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told HuffPost. \u201cTheir country has fallen into hell.\u201dBut Graham acknowledged that it would be difficult to win over enough Republicans to get the bill through the Senate, saying his colleagues have \u201ca legitimate concern\u201d that Afghan nationals could pose a security risk. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), for instance, argued that President Joe Biden\u2019s administration failed to vet the 80,000 Afghans admitted to the U.S. last year. A Defense Department report from February said its records on 50 Afghan evacuees indicated \u201cpotentially significant security concerns.\u201d\u201cI think we need to start by finding out who\u2019s here and what their background is, and making sure people around the country know where these people went to,\u201d Scott told HuffPost. As November\u2019s midterm elections approach, Republicans have been more hostile toward immigrants in general, with some describing them as invaders pouring through an insecure southern border. GOP governors have even sent buses and planes full of migrants to Democratic-led cities as a political stunt.In August 2021, the Biden administration used a measure known as humanitarian parole to allow Afghans to enter the U.S. for a two-year period. Officials ran evacuees\u2019 fingerprints and records through criminal and terrorism databases at military installations in Europe and the Middle East. Parole is not recognized as an immigration status, and it offers no road to permanent residency. The main options for Afghans are asylum and special immigrant status, but these can be complicated and costly to attain.The Biden administration announced in March that Afghans would be eligible for temporary protected status, preventing them from having to return to unsafe conditions, but TPS does not guarantee permanent residency.Advocates of the Afghan Adjustment Act \u2014 who point to the fact that Afghans in the U.S. could lose eligibility for humanitarian parole or temporary protected status next year and potentially face deportation \u2014 are optimistic about the bill\u2019s prospects.\u201cEven if we run out of time this month, we have other opportunities to get this done,\u201d said Chris Purdy, the director of Veterans for American Ideals and Outreach at the nonprofit Human Rights First. \u201cPassing this bill is a major priority for members in both houses. And every time we\u2019ve brought this to Congress, we\u2019ve gotten more and more supporters. Passage of the Afghan Adjustment Act is not a matter of if; it\u2019s a matter of when.\u201dThere has been less violence in Afghanistan since the U.S. finished its withdrawal last summer, but the ruling Taliban reportedly still target former members of the military and government officials, despite a declared amnesty. The government is accused of persecuting minority groups and imprisoning and torturing journalists, while women face restrictive new laws. The country is also experiencing an economic crisis, which is primarily the result of frozen assets in the United States, as well as other factors such as drought.Still, the near future is unlikely to see a critical mass of support for protecting Afghan evacuees, and Republicans could take control of one or both chambers of Congress next year, which would make this even more difficult. \u201cI just wish we could all agree, conceptually, that the people who are here have no place to go back, and they were involved in a war that we were involved in for 20 years and how we treat them will say a lot about how people will fight with us in the future,\u201d Graham said. On Thursday, a small number of supporters rallied for the bill outside of Congress. \u201cMany of those we are advocating for, if not all, have made the ultimate sacrifice by putting their lives in danger protecting democracy and helping our men and women in uniform,\u201d Jawaid Kotwal, an Afghan American, told Huffpost.\u201cSo we owe it to them. We did it in the past, for Vietnamese and Kurds. So it\u2019s the moral responsibility of the U.S. government to protect these people, and those who have already made it, to give them a pathway and road map towards citizenship.\u201dAfghan Fellow, HuffPostSenior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

He had provided the committee with thousands of text messages, including communications with outside Trump allies and advisers.In a filing in April in a federal lawsuit over his House subpoena, a lawyer for Meadows accused the committee of trying to vilify him publicly, noting that all of the texts it had been provided had been disclosed to the news media. The committee declined at the time to respond to the accusation.Meadows did not provide to the committee records he believed were subject to claims of executive privilege and those documents were also not produced to the Justice Department.___Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP___Follow the AP\u2019s coverage of Jan. 6 at https://apnews.com/hub/capitol-siege\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostSeth Magaziner, Rhode Island\u2019s general treasurer, won a Democratic congressional primary to succeed retiring Rep. Jim Langevin (D) on Tuesday.Magaziner, a business-friendly liberal who raised the most money in the field and was endorsed by Langevin, defeated five other contenders seeking the Democratic nomination in Rhode Island\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. His victory is a win for the state\u2019s Democratic Party establishment and allied groups, which saw him as the most viable general-election candidate.Magaziner is due to face Republican nominee Allan Fung, the former mayor of Cranston, Rhode Island, in November. National Republicans have indicated that they plan to seriously contest the seat. They see Fung, who characterizes himself as a centrist, as the kind of candidate who can win in a politically and geographically diverse district that President Joe Biden would have carried by 14 percentage points in 2020.But Democrats plan to lump Fung in with his Republican backers, turning the race into a referendum on GOP control of the House rather than Fung\u2019s personal merits or reputation as a mayor.\u201cThere\u2019s certainly nothing moderate about supporting [House Republican Leader] Kevin McCarthy, who has made clear that he wants to cut Social Security and Medicare and pass a national abortion ban,\u201d Magaziner told HuffPost last week. McCarthy has indicated that he will entertain legislation restricting abortion on a national level but has not specified his plans. Fung, who supports allowing abortions in cases of rape and incest, has said he would not prioritize limits on abortion rights, though he did not rule out support for federal bans in an interview with The Boston Globe after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s abortion-restricting decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health in June. But Fung gave Democrats an opening to nationalize the race in August when he welcomed McCarthy to Rhode Island for a fundraiser. He also attended a retreat for Republican donors that McCarthy hosted in Wyoming later that month.Fung, who ran two competitive but ultimately unsuccessful races for governor, identifies as a fiscal conservative focused on trimming budgets and improving government services for constituents. The son of immigrants from Hong Kong, Fung would be Rhode Island\u2019s first non-white member of Congress.\u201cI would definitely be proud to kind of kick open that bamboo ceiling, ensure that other individuals can follow behind,\u201d he told the Globe. \u201cBut the most important thing is those pocketbook issues, wallet issues, that we\u2019re all facing in Rhode Island and as a country.\u201dMagaziner, whose father, Ira, was a successful management consultant and adviser to former President Bill Clinton, was born into a storied family in Democratic politics. He parlayed his upbringing and his family\u2019s financial success into a career in state politics, where he endeared himself to organized labor with his support for policies such as a state infrastructure bank.During the primary, Magaziner, who dropped out of the governor\u2019s race to run for Congress, successfully argued that his record of statewide electoral success made him the best candidate to defeat Fung. He triumphed over former Langevin aide Joy Fox, former Biden administration official Sarah Morgenthau, former state Rep. David Segal, refugee activist Omar Bah and former state Rep. Spencer Dickinson. Magaziner and Morgenthau were the only two candidates with the resources to advertise on television.One potential liability for Magaziner is that until a few months ago he lived just outside the boundaries of Rhode Island\u2019s 2nd District. He and his family now rent a home in the district, and he touts his experience working in the district as general treasurer.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Entertainment Reporter, HuffPostJean-Luc Godard, one of the world\u2019s most revered film directors, known for his radical techniques and open-ended narrative structures, has died, the French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration and Deadline reported Tuesday. He was 91. An elusive intellectual with a disdain for most modern American movies, Godard was a defining figure of the French New Wave, that unofficial troop of 1950s and \u201960s filmmakers whose idiosyncratic work fixated on social and political unrest. Godard outlived most of his peers, including Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut, \u00c9ric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette and Claude Chabrol. Born in Paris on Dec. 3, 1930, Gordard enjoyed a life of wealth and literary scholarship. His father was a French-born physician who gained citizenship in Switzerland, where the family lived for many years. His mother was the daughter of upscale bankers. Godard discovered an affinity for movies after World War II, when he began visiting the Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise, which houses one of the world\u2019s largest film archives. It was there that he met Truffaut, Rohmer, Rivette and Chabrol. These five young men became fast friends, and Godard began spending his free time engaging with cinema. He was determined to restore silent-film values to the well-established world of talkies. Godard\u2019s first brush with notoriety came as a critic writing for the admired new French magazine Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, co-founded by Andr\u00e9 Bazin, a grandfather of the auteur theory. Godard\u2019s writing presaged the qualities we\u2019d soon see in his own films, chiefly the notion that movies are just as powerful an art form as novels, poetry and painting.Godard\u2019s big-screen debut is one of the most auspicious directorial introductions in history, every bit as promising as D.W. Griffith\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d (minus the racism), Orson Welles\u2019 \u201cCitizen Kane,\u201d Mike Nichols\u2019 \u201cWho\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\u201d and Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cReservoir Dogs.\u201d That movie is 1960\u2019s \u201cBreathless,\u201d a freewheeling drama about a charming French hoodlum and the American exchange student he loves. Initially envisioned as a documentary, \u201cBreathless\u201d was shot with handheld cameras and non-artificial lighting to achieve a naturalistic feel \u2015 novel concepts at the time. Godard was the first to use prominent jump-cuts, today considered a groundbreaking advancement in film editing.\u201cBreathless\u201d was met with ravenous reviews. In 2010, New York Times critic A.O. Scott wrote, \u201cEven now, at 50, it is still cool, still new, still \u2014 after all this time! \u2014 a bulletin from the future of movies.\u201d A 2016 poll in the British magazine Sight & Sound named \u201cBreathless\u201d the 13th greatest movie of all time.Godard again found acclaim with the 1963 backstage drama \u201cContempt\u201d and the 1964 crime comedy \u201cBand of Outsiders,\u201d which appeared on Time magazine\u2019s list of the 100 greatest movies. His overall career grew increasingly political after \u201cBreathless,\u201d chronicling such topics as financial gloom (1962\u2019s \u201cMy Life to Live\u201d), the horrors of war (1963\u2019s \u201cThe Carabineers\u201d) and consumerism (1967\u2019s \u201cWeekend\u201d). Godard\u2019s staunch opposition to the Vietnam War was a trademark of 1967\u2019s \u201cTwo or Three Things I Know About Her.\u201d All the while, his work became less commercial and more elliptical. Many projected Marxist interpretations onto Godard\u2019s filmography, though he said in a rare interview in 2016, that he had never read Karl Marx\u2019s writings.Throughout most of his post-1960s career, Godard\u2019s movies were not widely released in America. Regardless, his stature as a legend hardly waned. He found a minor second wind with 1982\u2019s \u201cPassion,\u201d a story about filmmaking that starred Isabelle Huppert, but most of his work was dense and obscure. In 1987, his \u201cKing Lear,\u201d a postmodern abstraction that borrows elements of the Shakespeare tragedy, premiered at the Cannes Film Festival and saw a quick two-week run stateside. In 1998, Godard completed \u201cHistoire(s) du cin\u00e9ma,\u201d a nearly four-hour, subjective rumination on film history that some consider the most important piece of his later career. The director was awarded an honorary Oscar in 2011, but he did not travel to America to accept the prize.Despite making 18 movies between 1980 and his death, 2010\u2019s divisive \u201cFilm Socialism\u201d and 2014\u2019s experimental 3D essay \u201cGoodbye to Language\u201d were the only projects with notable American exhibitions, as both screened at the New York Film Festival. The latter was acclaimed, with many critics calling it one of the year\u2019s best. \u201cLanguage\u201d won a jury prize at Cannes, but a producer accepted on Godard\u2019s behalf.Two precepts held steady throughout these years: Godard never stopped experimenting with technology or using his platform to challenge the globe\u2019s political strictures. Amid his spotty mainstream attention over the past few decades, Godard decried the so-called death of quality motion pictures. \u201cI am not an auteur, well, not now, anyways,\u201d he said in 2011. \u201cWe once believed we were auteurs, but we weren\u2019t. We had no idea, really. Film is over. It\u2019s sad nobody is really exploring it. But what to do? And anyway, with mobile phones and everything, everyone is now an auteur.\u201dSometimes accused of anti-Semitism and often resistant to life as a public figure, Godard went out as a cranky talent who rose to prominence in the age of affluent cinematic misfits. In 2018, he released \u201cLe Livre d\u2019image,\u201d an essay-film full of \u201cGodard\u2019s familiar end-of-civilization motifs,\u201d as a Los Angeles Times critic put it, that focused on the Middle East. As of 2016, Godard said he still \u201c[hadn\u2019t] started thinking about\u201d how he\u2019d like to be remembered. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve succeeded in making any really good films,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are moments, scenes, whole movements that sing. It has all added up to a cinema of sorts, even though I\u2019m still learning my art.\u201dSenior Entertainment Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

David Segal; former Biden Cabinet official Sarah Morgenthau; refugee activist Omar Bah; and former state Rep. Spencer Dickinson.Fung led all of his potential Democratic challengers in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup, according to a public poll conducted in June shortly before the Supreme Court ruling that overturned the constitutional right to an abortion.\u201cAllan Fung is not Donald Trump,\u201d said Wendy Schiller, a political scientist at Brown University. \u201cThat\u2019s the big challenge for Democrats to hold the seat. Can they convince voters that a vote for Allan Fung is a vote for [House Republican Leader] Kevin McCarthy and a vote for Donald Trump?\u201dMagaziner, who boasts the widest array of endorsements and the largest war chest, is the polling favorite.\u201cEven with undecideds, he\u2019s got enough people who are going to affirmatively try to choose him,\u201d Schiller said. \u201cAnd increasingly in the last month, Democrats in that district have come to see him as the most competitive against Fung. Those Democrats are persuaded that this seat could give Republicans control of the House.\u201dMagaziner, who has overseen Rhode Island\u2019s finances since 2014, has deep roots in Democratic politics \u2015 both locally and nationally. Magaziner\u2019s father, Ira, a successful management consultant, is best known for helming President Bill Clinton\u2019s unsuccessful health care reform initiative in 1993 and 1994. Magaziner credits his family\u2019s wealth for enabling him to lend his first campaign for treasurer more than $800,000.As treasurer, Magaziner endeared himself to Rhode Island\u2019s labor unions with his support for the creation of an infrastructure bank \u2015 and to financial industry donors with his pursuit of aggressive, nontraditional investments for the state\u2019s pension fund. (Magaziner maintains that he was simply seeking the best possible returns for retired state employees.)Magaziner has also benefited from a head start on fundraising from an abandoned bid for governor that he launched in September 2021. He decided in late January to run for Congress instead, following Langevin\u2019s announcement that he would be retiring.Relieved not to have to choose between Magaziner and Lt. Gov. Dan McKee in the gubernatorial race, top Democrats, labor unions and other party-aligned groups quickly coalesced behind Magaziner\u2019s congressional bid. The League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund, an environmental super PAC, has spent nearly $400,000 in support of Magaziner\u2019s bid. And Magaziner stands to benefit from the support of Langevin, who endorsed him in June.\u201cIt\u2019s time to stop the fighting and get to work.\u201dMagaziner is running on a relatively conventional Democratic platform. In his TV ads, he has emphasized his support for abortion rights and stricter gun laws, as well as his commitment to protecting Social Security and Medicare.\u201cI\u2019m running for Congress because I want to make it easier for working people to get ahead and build a good, stable life,\u201d he declared in a Sept. 1 debate.There are signs, however, that Magaziner would resemble more business-friendly members of the House Democratic Caucus, though not quite to the extent of the party\u2019s most conservative outliers. While he has picked up the endorsement of progressive Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, he\u2019s also been endorsed by Rep. Jake Auchincloss (D-Mass.), a prominent moderate. Although Magaziner is refusing to accept contributions from political action committees affiliated with the gun, fossil fuel, and pharmaceutical industries, he has not forsworn money from all corporate PACs. And Web3 Forward, a super PAC that advocates for lighter regulation of the cryptocurrency industry, has spent over $162,000 on advertisements supporting Magaziner.Magaziner has also distinguished himself from his rivals by criticizing Biden\u2019s forgiveness of $10,000 in student debt for Americans earning under $125,000. He has said he prefers to reduce interest rates on loans, but told HuffPost in an interview that he would not vote against Biden\u2019s debt cancellation if it were put to a vote in Congress and it was the only real reform on the table.\u201cWhat I\u2019m very concerned about as well is that we fix the underlying structural issues about how higher education is financed, so we don\u2019t end up in the same situation five years from now,\u201d he said.Other contenders have made the case that they are more electable against Fung than Magaziner would be. And in the event of an upset loss for Magaziner, Democrats will get a chance to test alternative theories of electability in a state where Democratic congressional candidates are less accustomed to contentious general elections. Sarah Morgenthau, a former Department of Commerce official under Biden and Department of Homeland Security official under President Barack Obama, has raised the second-largest amount of money after Magaziner. They are the only two candidates who have been able to advertise on television.Morgenthau, whose mother unsuccessfully sought the seat in 1988, is running more than anything on her identity as a woman and the possibility of becoming the first Democratic woman to represent Rhode Island in Congress. One of her TV ads features the lyrics \u201cRoe, Roe, Roe, your vote\u201d \u2015 a reference to the overturned Roe v. Wade decision that created a constitutional right to abortion \u2015 to the tune of \u201cRow, Row, Row Your Boat.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s time to stop the fighting and get to work,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been about throughout my life and throughout my career.\u201d Morgenthau said she is the candidate best equipped to beat Fung because, among other things, she is \u201ccoming in with a heck of a lot of experience.\u201dBut Morgenthau, a granddaughter of the New Deal-era Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau, has considerable baggage. She owns a summer home in Rhode Island, but only made the state her permanent home recently in order to run for Congress. \u201cRhode Island has been my home for 40 years,\u201d Morgenthau insisted during a recent televised Democratic primary debate, noting her mother\u2019s run for Congress in the area over three decades ago. \u201cWhile my heart is here in Rhode Island, my experience has been everywhere \u2015 and it\u2019s exactly that experience that I will bring to bring back results for folks here in Rhode Island.\u201dMagaziner has a less striking residency problem of his own, having moved into the district from his former home on the east side of Providence in order to run in Rhode Island\u2019s 2nd.Magaziner said that his work as treasurer, which included school construction and clean-energy financing plans, have put him in touch with the district\u2019s needs.\u201cI will put my hometown girl against his hometown boy all day long.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve worked in every city and town in the district to solve problems,\u201d he told HuffPost. By contrast, Fox \u2015 a political consultant and former local journalist who also worked for former Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo (D), now the U.S. secretary of commerce \u2015 touts her local ties. A resident of Warwick, Fox jokes that she doesn\u2019t commute much beyond her family home in Cranston, where she and her mother are caring for a father with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. \u201cI grew up in the city [Fung] was mayor of,\u201d Fox said. \u201cI will put my hometown girl against his hometown boy all day long.\u201d Fox also noted that she was part of the campaign team that helped Raimondo defeat Fung in two consecutive gubernatorial races.The challenge for Fox is in letting enough Democratic voters know she exists, despite her small budget \u2015 and convincing them she\u2019ll be able to scale up in a competitive race come November.\u201cYou could envision Joy Fox beating Allan Fung with money, because Joy Fox can use the national theme [of beating Republicans] and also claim the mantle of a local Rhode Islander who was born and raised here,\u201d Schiller said.Omar Bah, a political refugee from Gambia who founded a nonprofit that serves refugees in Providence, is a long-shot candidate who had raised less than $63,000 as of late August. But he too has an electability case to make, arguing that a failure to nominate him risks ceding a portion of nonwhite voters to Fung, with whom they may identify because he has Chinese ancestry.\u201cIf Allan Fung goes against Seth Magaziner or any other white candidate, he will take a large chunk of people of color from the Democratic Party who otherwise would have voted for me,\u201d Bah told HuffPost.The policy differences between Magaziner, Fox, Morgenthau and Bah are relatively modest \u2015 and not a major focus of their respective bids. Dickinson and Segal, by contrast, are making an ideological case, albeit from opposite ends of the spectrum. Dickinson argues that the Democratic Party has moved much too far to the left, prompting centrist and conservative voters to leave the party. Dickinson has sparse policy material on his campaign website, but he does name \u201cclosing\u201d the U.S.-Mexico border as his highest priority. \u201cIf the President won\u2019t do it, then the Congress must,\u201d he declares. \u201cUse the Army if necessary.\u201dSegal, who founded the advocacy group Demand Progress and is backed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), has carved out the progressive lane in the race, running as a foe of \u201ccorporate special interests and political corruption.\u201d Segal\u2019s platform includes the standard array of left-wing policies, including support for Medicare for All and the Green New Deal.But Segal also emphasizes his record of building bipartisan coalitions for liberal goals like reducing the power of big technology firms and ending U.S. support for the Saudi Arabia-led invasion of Yemen. And he insists that without a populist critique of a rigged economic and political system, Democrats are at a disadvantage against Fung.\u201cThe general election here needs to be taken really seriously,\u201d Segal said. \u201cThe way to do that is to nominate somebody who has a 20-year record of taking on outsize corporate power. This is a really popular fight.\u201dRhode Island has a history of electing Democrats with socially conservative tendencies. Until recently, many top Democrats in the state legislature supported gun rights and restrictions on abortion access.Segal nonetheless hopes to appeal to the state\u2019s sizable population of working-class voters, some of whom have shown a receptiveness to a populist message. The state\u2019s Democratic primary voters opted for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential primary. Some of Sanders\u2019 biggest margins were in Warwick and Cranston, key population centers in Rhode Island\u2019s 2nd. Sanders endorsed Segal last Thursday.\u201cThe way to do that is to nominate somebody who has a 20-year record of taking on outsize corporate power. This is a really popular fight.\u201dWhat Segal lacks in TV advertising, he could make up for in grassroots support, which carries greater weight in low-turnout races. Segal\u2019s campaign released an internal poll earlier this month that showed him gaining ground on Magaziner. And the Working Families Party has since spent more than $87,000 on paid phone banking and digital ads in support of Segal\u2019s bid. Finally, the mysterious super PAC Ocean State Forward has emerged as a wild card with a last-minute spending spree in the race\u2019s final days. The group, whose funders and agenda are unknown, has spent more than $102,000 on direct-mail literature attacking Magaziner.\u201cSeth Magaziner claims to be a progressive Democrat who fights for working families, but he has taken more special interest campaign cash than any candidate for Congress,\u201d one mail item alleges.Ocean State Forward is run by Democratic political operative Jennifer May. But the attack mirrors the critiques of Magaziner that national Republicans have already made.\u201cAllan Fung led the Cranston comeback and has proven that one-party rule is hurting Rhode Islanders whose cost of living has surged with Democrats in control,\u201d Samantha Bullock, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said in a statement. \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a greater contrast between Fung and Silver Spoon Seth Magaziner, whose political career is bankrolled by his rich dad while he works to deliver for his Wall Street friends.\u201dRegardless of the race\u2019s outcome on Tuesday, national Democrats are preparing to nationalize the general election and paint Fung as a foot soldier for Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.). Fung gave the party some ammunition when he welcomed McCarthy in person to raise money for him in Rhode Island in August. He also attended McCarthy\u2019s national GOP donor retreat in Wyoming later in the month.Fung, who opposes late-term abortions and public funding for abortions, has said that restricting abortion would not be a priority for him in Congress. \u201cIn Rhode Island, they\u2019ve already spoken about this issue,\u201d Fung told The Boston Globe, referring to the state\u2019s codification of abortion rights in 2019. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not running to try to change the laws on abortion.\u201dBut Fung would not commit to supporting federal legislation codifying abortion rights, which Democrats see as grounds enough to brand him an abortion rights opponent.\u201cFung is an anti-abortion empty suit who would be a rubber stamp for Kevin McCarthy\u2019s dangerous agenda to cut Social Security, do Donald Trump\u2019s bidding, and ban abortion nationwide,\u201d James Singer, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told HuffPost in a statement.Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden is set to channel John F. Kennedy on the 60th anniversary of JFK\u2019s moonshot speech, highlighting Biden administration efforts aimed at \u201cending cancer as we know it.\u201dThe president was traveling to Boston on Monday to draw attention to a new federally backed study that seeks to validate using blood tests to screen against multiple cancers \u2014 a potential game-changer in diagnostic testing to dramatically improve early detection of cancers. He also planned other announcements meant to better the lives of those suffering from cancer.His speech at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum comes as Biden seeks to rally the nation around developing treatments and therapeutics for the pervasive diseases that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rank as the second-highest killer of people in the U.S. after heart disease. Biden hopes to move the U.S. closer to the goal he set in February of cutting U.S. cancer fatalities by 50% over the next 25 years and to dramatically improve the lives of caregivers and those suffering from cancer.Danielle Carnival, the White House cancer moonshot coordinator, told The Associated Press that the administration sees huge potential in the commencement of the blood diagnostic study on identifying and treating cancers.\u201cOne of the most promising technologies has been the development of blood tests that offer the promise of detecting multiple cancers in a single blood test and really imagining the impact that could have on our ability to detect cancer early and in a more equitable way,\u201d Carnival said. \u201cWe think the best way to get us to the place where those are realized is to really test out the technologies we have today and see what works and what really has an impact on extending lives.\u201dIn 2022, the American Cancer Society estimates, 1.9 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed and 609,360 people will die of cancer diseases.The issue is personal to Biden, who lost his adult son Beau in 2015 to brain cancer. After Beau\u2019s death, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which dedicated $1.8 billion over seven years for cancer research and was signed into law in 2016 by President Barack Obama.Obama designated Biden, then vice president, to run \u201cmission control\u201d on directing the cancer funds as a recognition of Biden\u2019s grief as a parent and desire to do something about it. Biden wrote in his memoir \u201cPromise Me, Dad\u201d that he chose not to run for president in 2016 primarily because of Beau\u2019s death.Despite Biden\u2019s attempts to hark back to Kennedy and his space program, the current initiative lacks that same level of budgetary support. The Apollo program garnered massive public investment \u2014 more than $20 billion, or more than $220 billion in 2022 dollars adjusted for inflation. Biden\u2019s \u201cmoonshot\u201d effort is far more modest and reliant on private sector investment.Still, Biden has tried to maintain momentum for investments in public health research, including championing the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, modeled after similar research and development initiatives benefiting the Pentagon and intelligence community.On Monday, Biden will announce Dr. Renee Wegrzyn as the inaugural director of ARPA-H, which has been given the task of studying treatments and potential cures for cancers, Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes and other diseases. He will also announce a new National Cancer Institute scholars\u2019 program to provide resources to early-career scientists studying treatments and cures for cancer.In Boston, Biden will also attend an event at Logan International Airport to highlight investments from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law as well as a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee.Experts agree it\u2019s far too early to say whether these new blood tests for finding cancer in healthy people will have any effect on cancer deaths. There have been no studies to show they reduce the risk of dying from cancer. Still, they say setting an ambitious goal is important.Carnival said the National Cancer Institute Study was designed so that any promising diagnostic results could be swiftly put into widespread practice while the longer-term study \u2014 expected to last up to a decade \u2014 progresses. She said the goal was to move closer to a future where cancers could be detected through routine bloodwork, potentially reducing the need for more invasive and burdensome procedures like colonoscopies, and therefore saving lives.Scientists now understand that cancer is not a single disease, but hundreds of diseases that respond differently to different treatments. Some cancers have biomarkers that can be targeted by existing drugs that will slow a tumor\u2019s growth. Many more targets await discovery.\u201cHow do we learn what therapies are effective in which subtypes of disease? That to me is oceanic,\u201d said Donald A. Berry, a biostatistician at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. \u201cThe possibilities are enormous. The challenges are enormous.\u201dDespite the challenges, he\u2019s optimistic about cutting the cancer death rate in half over the next 25 years.\u201cWe can get to that 50% goal by slowing the disease sufficiently across the various cancers without curing anybody,\u201d Berry said. \u201cIf I were to bet on whether we will achieve this 50% reduction, I would bet yes.\u201dEven without new breakthroughs, progress can be made by making care more equitable, said Dr. Crystal Denlinger, chief scientific officer for the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a group of elite cancer centers.And any effort to reduce the cancer death rate will need to focus on the biggest cancer killer, which is lung cancer. Mostly attributable to smoking, lung cancer now causes more cancer deaths than any other cancer. Of the 1,670 daily cancer deaths in the United States, more than 350 are from lung cancer.Lung cancer screening is helping. The American Cancer Society says such screening helped drive down the cancer death rate 32% from its peak in 1991 to 2019, the most recent year for which numbers are available.But only 5% of eligible patients are being screened for lung cancer.\u201cIt\u2019s tragic,\u201d said Dr. Roy Herbst, a lung specialist at Yale Cancer Center.\u201cThe moonshot is going to have to be a social fix as well as a scientific and medical fix,\u201d Herbst said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to find a way that screening becomes easier, that it\u2019s fully covered, that we have more screening facilities.\u201dBiden planned to urge Americans who might have delayed cancer screenings during the pandemic to seek them out swiftly, reminding them that early detection can be key to avoiding adverse outcomes.He was also set to highlight provisions in the Democrats\u2019 healthcare and climate change bill that the administration believes will lower out of pocket drug prices for some widely used cancer treatments. He will also celebrate new guarantees for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits, that cover their potential cancer diagnoses.Dr. Michael Hassett of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said Biden\u2019s goal to reduce cancer deaths could met by following two parallel paths: one of discovery and the other making sure as many people as possible are reaping the advantages of existing therapies and preventive approaches.\u201cIf we can address both aspects, both challenges, major advances are possible,\u201d Hassett said.In breast cancer, for example, many women who could benefit from a hormone-blocking pill either never start the therapy or stop taking it before the recommended five years, Hassett\u2019s research has found.\u201cThose are big gaps,\u201d Hassett said. \u201cThat\u2019s a treatment that\u2019s effective. But if many people aren\u2019t taking that medication or if they\u2019re taking it but stopping it before concluding the course of therapy, then the benefits that the medicine could offer aren\u2019t realized.\u201d___Johnson reported from Seattle.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden marked the 21st anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, taking part in a somber wreath-laying ceremony at the Pentagon held under a steady rain and paying tribute to \u201cextraordinary Americans\u201d who gave their lives on one of the nation\u2019s darkest days.Sunday\u2019s ceremony occurred a little more than a year after Biden ended the long and costly war in Afghanistan that the U.S. and allies launched in response to the terror attacks.Biden noted that even after the United States left Afghanistan that his administration continues to pursue those responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Last month, Biden announced the U.S. had killed Ayman al-Zawahri, the al-Qaida leader who helped plot the Sept. 11 attacks, in a clandestine operation.\u201cWe will never forget, we will never give up,\u201d Biden said. \u201cOur commitment to preventing another attack on the United States is without end.\u201dThe president was joined by family members of the fallen, first responders who had been at the Pentagon on the day of the attack, as well as Defense Department leadership for the annual moment of tribute carried out in New York City, the Pentagon and Somerset County, Pennsylvania.In ending the Afghanistan war, the Democratic president followed through on a campaign pledge to bring home U.S. troops from the country\u2019s longest conflict. But the war concluded chaotically in August 2021, when the U.S.-backed Afghan government collapsed, a grisly bombing killed 170 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops at Kabul\u2019s airport, and thousands of desperate Afghans gathered in hopes of escape before the final U.S. cargo planes departed over the Hindu Kush.Biden marked the one-year anniversary of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan late last month in low-key fashion. He issued a statement in honor of the 13 U.S. troops killed in the bombing at the Kabul airport and spoke by phone with U.S. veterans assisting ongoing efforts to resettle in the United States Afghans who helped the war effort.Biden on Sunday said an \u201cincredible debt\u201d was owed to the U.S. troops who served in Afghanistan as well as their families. More than 2,200 U.S. service members were killed and more than 20,000 were wounded over the course of the nearly 20-year war, according to the Pentagon.He also vowed that the nation will \u201cnever fail to meet the sacred obligation to you to properly prepare and equip those that we send into harm\u2019s way and care for those and their families when they come home \u2014 and to never, ever, ever forget.\u201dSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday criticized Biden\u2019s handling of the end of the war and noted that the country has spiraled downward under renewed Taliban rule since the U.S. withdrawal.\u201cNow, one year on from last August\u2019s disaster, the devastating scale of the fallout from President Biden\u2019s decision has come into sharper focus,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAfghanistan has become a global pariah. Its economy has shrunk by nearly a third. Half of its population is now suffering critical levels of food insecurity.\u201dThe president also remembered the words of comfort Queen Elizabeth II, who died last week, sent to the American people soon after the 2001 attacks: \u201cGrief is the price we pay for love.\u201d Biden said those words remain as poignant as they did 21 years ago but the weight of loss also remains heavy.\u201cOn this day, when the price feels so great, Jill and I are holding all of you close to our hearts.\u201d Biden said.Biden has recently dialed up warnings about what he calls the \u201cextreme ideology\u201d of former President Donald Trump and his \u201cMAGA Republican\u201d adherents as a threat to American democracy. Without naming Trump, Biden again on Sunday raised a call for Americans to safeguard democracy.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to stand up for democracy once a year or every now and then,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s something we have to do every single day. So this is a day not only to remember, but also is a day for renewal and resolve for each and every American in our devotion to this country, to the principles it embodies, to our democracy.\u201dFirst lady Jill Biden spoke to a crowd at the Flight 93 National Memorial Observance in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, where she recalled the concern she had about her sister Bonny Jacobs, a United Airlines flight attendant.She said the attacks showed that \u201cwith courage and kindness we can be a light in that darkness.\u201d\u201cIt showed us that we are all connected to one another,\u201d said Biden, who was joined by her sister in Shanksville for Sunday\u2019s commemoration. \u201cSo as we stand on this sacred and scarred earth, a record of our collective grief and a monument to the memories that live on each day, this is the legacy we much carry forward: Hope that defies hate.\u201dVice President Kamala Harris and her husband attended a commemoration ceremony at the National September 11th Memorial in New York.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Justice Department and Donald Trump\u2019s legal team proposed candidates Friday for the role of an independent arbiter in the investigation into top-secret documents found at the former president\u2019s Florida home, but the two sides differed on the scope of duties the person would have.Lawyers for Trump said they believe the so-called special master should review all documents seized by the FBI during its search last month of Mar-a-Lago, including records with classification markings, and filter out any that may be protected by claims of executive privilege.The Justice Department said it does not believe the arbiter should be permitted to inspect classified records or to take into account potential claims of executive privilege.U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon had given both sides until Friday to submit potential candidates for the role of a special master, as well as proposals for the scope of the person\u2019s duties and the schedule for his or her work.The Justice Department submitted the names of two retired judges \u2014 Barbara Jones, who served on the federal bench in Manhattan and performed the same role in prior high-profile investigations, and Thomas Griffith, a former federal appeals court jurist in the District of Columbia.The Trump team proposed one retired judge, Raymond Dearie \u2014 also the former top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of New York \u2014 and prominent Florida lawyer Paul Huck Jr.The back-and-forth over the special master is playing out amid an FBI investigation into the retention of several hundred classified documents recovered from Mar-a-Lago within the past year. Though the legal wrangling is unlikely to have major long-term effects on the criminal investigation or knock it significantly off course, it will almost certainly delay it and has already caused the intelligence community to temporarily pause a national risk assessment.Over the strenuous objections of the Justice Department, Cannon on Monday granted the Trump team\u2019s request for the special master and directed the department to temporarily halt its review of records for investigative purposes.She said the person would be responsible for sifting through the records recovered during the Aug. 8 search of Mar-a-Lago and filtering out any documents potentially covered by claims of attorney-client or executive privilege.Roughly 11,000 documents \u2014 including more than 100 with classified markings, some at the top-secret level \u2014 were recovered during the search. That\u2019s on top of classified documents contained in 15 boxes retrieved in January by the National Archives and Records Administration, and additional sensitive government records the department took back during a June visit to Mar-a-Lago.The Justice Department had objected to the Trump team\u2019s request for a special master, saying it had already completed its own review in which identified a limited subset of records that possibly involve attorney-client privilege. It has maintained that executive privilege does not apply in this investigation because Trump, no longer president, had no right to claim the documents as his.The department on Thursday filed a notice of appeal indicating that it would contest the judge\u2019s order to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. Officials asked the judge to lift her hold on their investigative work pending their appeal, as well as her requirement that the department share with a special master the classified records that were recovered.It is not clear whether Trump or anyone else will be charged.This is a developing story.

With three additional entries to the franchise in the works, Cameron was particularly delighted to finally showcase new scenes from the upcoming film.\u201cI\u2019m super excited to be finally finishing up movie two,\u201d Cameron told the audience. \u201cI know everyone\u2019s been waiting a long time.

The underwater sequences reportedly dazzled the crowd as viewers returned to the fictional world of Pandora.The original film, which saw the United States Marines invade an alien species named the Na\u2019vi, broke box office records and has since grossed nearly $3 billion.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 An ex-business manager for R. Kelly and his co-defendant at the singer\u2019s federal trial in Chicago expressed doubts on the witness stand Thursday about Kelly\u2019s insistence in the 2000s that he never sexually abused minors \u2014 testifying a day after the former employee told jurors he had had no reason to doubt his boss was telling the truth.Derrell McDavid\u2019s testimony, which could be a major blow to Kelly\u2019s hope of acquittal, came at the end McDavid\u2019s second day on the stand. He and the Grammy winner are charged with successfully fixing Kelly\u2019s 2008 child pornography trial by threatening witnesses and concealing video evidence. Both also face child pornography charges.Asked by his own lawyer, Beau Brindley, if he was in \u201ca different position\u201d now as far as assessing allegations against Kelly after sitting through government testimony by four Kelly accusers, McDavid responded solemnly: \u201cYes, I am.\u201d\u201cThe last (few) weeks \u2026 I\u2019ve learned a lot \u2026 that I had no idea about in 2008,\u201d he said. When he added that, \u201cas I stand here today, I\u2019m embarrassed\u2026 sad,\u201d Kelly\u2019s lead lawyer, Jennifer Bonjean, objected. Judge Harry Leinenweber sustained her objection.McDavid, who said earlier he once saw Kelly as a son, was also asked Thursday if he had wanted to believe Kelly in the 2000s and through to the end of Kelly\u2019s 2008 trial.\u201cI absolutely did,\u201d he answered, \u201cbecause I loved him and I believed in him.\u201dIt is in McDavid\u2019s interest to say he believed Kelly in much of the 2000s because it undermines the government\u2019s case that McDavid knew Kelly was guilty heading into the 2008 trial and would, if evidence wasn\u2019t suppressed, be convicted.With jurors out of the courtroom earlier, Bonjean said she was worried McDavid would \u2014 as he ended up doing \u2014 cast doubt about Kelly\u2019s believability. She said it would unfairly prejudice her client in jurors\u2019 eyes and, on some counts, seal his fate.Kelly\u2019s defense team has several times asked that Kelly\u2019s trial be severed from McDavid\u2019s and that Kelly be tried alone, saying their interests at a joint trial would inevitably conflict. Leinenweber has repeatedly rejected that request.Among the charges only Kelly faces at the current trial are five counts of enticing minor girls for sex \u2014 one count for five Kelly accusers. McDavid\u2019s testimony toward the end of the day Thursday could potentially lend credence to those accusations.Prosecutors are set to start what could be a blistering cross-examination of McDavid on Friday. McDavid\u2019s lengthy testimony seemed to open doors for prosecutors to ask him about otherwise barred topics, including evidence entered by state prosecutors at Kelly\u2019s 2008 trial.Earlier Thursday, McDavid also testified that a push to recover purported Kelly sex videos prior to the 2008 trial was driven, not by himself or Kelly, but by Kelly\u2019s now deceased-criminal lawyer, Ed Genson.With that testimony, McDavid sought to distance himself from decisions to aggressively pursue videos prior to the 2008 trial, including by offering six-figure payoffs for lost or stolen videos.The ongoing trial in Kelly\u2019s hometown is, in ways , a do-over of that 2008 trial. A single video, which state prosecutors said showed Kelly sexually abusing a girl of around 14, was at the heart of that trial. The same video is in evidence at the current trial.The girl in the video, then an adult, did not testify at that 2008 trial, which jurors said at the time was one reason they couldn\u2019t convict Kelly. She did testify at the current trial under the pseudonym, \u201cJane.\u201dThe otherwise dry, matter-of-fact McDavid sounded emotional for the first time in two days on the stand when asked Thursday how he felt when jurors at the 2008 trial acquitted Kelly on all charges.\u201cI was happy,\u201d he said, his voice appearing to break.During one lunch break during McDavid\u2019s testimony, McDavid stood next to Kelly sitting at his defense table \u2014 the two chatting amiably.On Thursday, McDavid told jurors he and Kelly began to grow apart in the years after the 2008 trial, friction between them highlighted by financial disputes. He quit working for Kelly in 2014, he testified.On Wednesday, McDavid told jurors he had seen Jane when she was a minor hanging around Kelly\u2019s studio in the late 1990s. He said Kelly angrily denied rumors he was sexually abusing Jane, who Kelly described as his god daughter.\u201cI believed him,\u201d McDavid testified.Testifying earlier, Jane, now 37, said Kelly sexually abused her hundreds of time starting when she was 14. She also said she was the girl in the video at the center of the 2008 trial and entered as evidence at the current trial. She said Kelly produced it.McDavid is the only one of the three defendants testifying in his own behalf. Both Kelly and Milton Brown, the third co-defendant, told the trial judge last week they would not testify.This trial follows a separate federal trial in New York, where the 55-year-old Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in June.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostLas Vegas police said Thursday that they have connected the DNA of a county official to the recent murder of investigative journalist Jeff German, whose coverage of alleged misconduct ultimately contributed to the official losing his primary election this summer.At a news conference, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo said that Clark County Public Administrator Robert Telles was arrested at his Las Vegas home and booked Wednesday night on a charge of murder with a deadly weapon. The 45-year-old Democrat was taken out of his home on a stretcher with what police said were self-inflicted wounds that were not life-threatening.Telles, 45, is accused of stabbing the Las Vegas Review-Journal reporter to death. Police said that they found German\u2019s body on Saturday morning outside of the reporter\u2019s house and that he was likely killed Friday morning.\u201cThis has been an unusual case from the beginning, the murder of an investigative journalist and the main suspect an elected official here in Clark County,\u201d Lombardo said. \u201cThis is a terrible and jarring homicide, one that has deeply impacted Las Vegas. Every murder is tragic, but the killing of a journalist is particularly troublesome.\u201dDori Koren, captain of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police\u2019s homicide division, said that a man was documented on surveillance images walking toward German\u2019s home on Friday and then to the side of his house. The man was wearing a straw hat, a bright orange long-sleeved shirt and gray sneakers, and was carrying a duffel bag. When German exited his house through the garage door and went to the side of the house, the intruder got into an altercation with him and the journalist was stabbed multiple times.Police identified a vehicle seen driving around German\u2019s neighborhood on the morning of the murder, prior to the murder and at the time of the murder. Koren also said that the man described by police had fled in that vehicle, a maroon GMC Yukon Denali SUV with chrome handles, a sunroof and a luggage rack.Telles became a person of interest because of his publicly expressed hatred toward the 69-year-old journalist and because a vehicle matching the description of the killer\u2019s car was parked in front of his home. Video evidence showed the car leaving Telles\u2019 home the morning of the homicide and arriving back shortly after the estimated time of the death. Police say they discovered Telles was driving the car that morning.When law enforcement searched Telles\u2019 home, vehicles and body, they said they found a pair of shoes matching the killer\u2019s clothing, splattered with blood and cut \u201clikely in a manner to destroy evidence.\u201d Police also said they recovered a straw hat matching the description, cut in a similar manner.(2/3) Telles was taken into custody on September 7, 2022 and is currently at the Clark County Detention Center. He has been charged with open murder with a deadly weapon. Click below for previously released photos of the suspect and vehicle. pic.twitter.com/cgnW1xlf8d\u201cOne of the most important aspects of this investigation was waiting on the DNA results, and we received positive DNA results that showed Robert Telles\u2019 DNA at the crime scene,\u201d Koren said.Lombardo said that police have not yet recovered a weapon but that the investigation is still active. Telles voluntarily was interviewed by police and chose not to retain a lawyer, according to the Las Vegas Police Department. He is being held at the Clark County Detention Center.\u201cJeff was a loving and loyal brother, uncle and friend who devoted his life to his work exposing wrongdoing in Las Vegas and beyond. We\u2019re shocked, saddened and angry about his death,\u201d German\u2019s family said in a statement obtained Thursday by the Review-Journal. \u201cJeff was committed to seeking justice for others and would appreciate the hard work by local police and journalists in pursuing his killer. We look forward to seeing justice done in this case,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe also want to thank everyone for the outpouring of love, support and recognition for Jeff and his life\u2019s work.\u201dGerman was a tenacious reporter who covered crime, courts, government corruption and mob figures for decades in Las Vegas. The journalist had launched a months-long investigation this year into Telles\u2019 office, which included allegations of abuses and an inappropriate relationship with an employee.German\u2019s investigation into the potential wrongdoing led to public outrage by Telles, who regularly tweeted his anger at the reporter. After a series of stories on Telles, the official lost his reelection bid in the June primary.According to police, Telles was likely also upset that German was conducting additional reporting on the official. The journalist recently filed public records requests for emails and texts between Telles and three other county officials \u2015 one of whom was identified in previous stories as the employee Telles allegedly had a relationship with, according to the Review-Journal.\u201cThe death of Jeff German was both shocking and tragic, and we join with our community in being stunned at how this situation has continued to evolve over the last few days,\u201d county spokesperson Stacey Welling said in a statement. \u201cClark County continues to cooperate with the LVMPD on this active investigation. Our condolences are with Jeff German\u2019s family, friends, and colleagues at the Review-Journal.\u201dThe county said it is \u201creviewing its options under the law regarding\u201d Telles\u2019 position as the public administrator, which is an elected office. The county has suspended Telles\u2019 access to county offices and property for \u201cthe safety of our county employees and the public\u201d and said that employees of the administrator\u2019s office are working remotely while the office remains closed \u201cuntil a determination is made about when it can open.\u201d\u201cWhen county management was made aware of the personnel issues at the public administrator\u2019s office a couple of months ago, the decision was made to no longer have staff in the public administrator\u2019s office report to Mr. Telles and this solution will be in place until the public elects a new Public Administrator in November,\u201d Welling said.Lombardo said Thursday that it was an \u201cinappropriate venue to speculate or opine on\u201d whether German\u2019s death is part of a nationwide normalization of violence against journalists.\u201cI think it needs to be stated and noted that it is troublesome because it is a journalist, and we expect journalism to be open and transparent and the watchdog for government,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when people take it upon themselves to create harm associated with that profession, I think it\u2019s very important we put all eyes on and address the case appropriately \u2015 such as we did in this case.\u201dReporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Trends ReporterWhen Norman Reedus suffered a concussion while filming the series finale of \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d in March, his publicist told EW he was \u201crecovering well\u201d \u2015 but in a new interview he said the injury left him in fear for his life and was far worse than the public knew.\u201cOh dude, that was horrible,\u201d Reedus told EW. \u201cThat whole ordeal for me personally was terrifying. I thought I was going to die.\u201dDetails about how the injury occurred have not been released.Just like his survivalist \u201cWalking Dead\u201d character Daryl Dixon, Reedus knows how to forge ahead. The actor has endured his fair share of injuries across 11 seasons of the hit AMC show, which will end in November. He once fell off a motorcycle, for instance, and cut his hand on a prop.On March 11, however, Reedus suffered a concussion so bad he had to be hospitalized for weeks. Details of the incident remained sparse and suggested Reedus was simply taking his time to recover. The actor himself, many of whose scenes were finished by a stand-in, now begs to differ.\u201cIt was very serious,\u201d Reedus told EW. \u201cIt was scary. I\u2019ve been hit in the face and the head a million times. I\u2019ve gone through car windows, but that one rung my bell.\u201d\u201cI had a neurologist.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior National Correspondent, HuffPostA proposal to protect abortion rights in Michigan is back on the November ballot, thanks to the state\u2019s Supreme Court.The proposal would amend Michigan\u2019s Constitution, codifying an array of reproductive rights that are currently in jeopardy thanks to this summer\u2019s U.S. Supreme Court decision overruling Roe v. Wade.With Roe no longer in force, states have the power to pass new laws prohibiting abortion or to enforce old bans that are still on the books. The latter is an especially real possibility in Michigan, where a 1931 law prohibits abortion at any stage of pregnancy and in almost all circumstances.The law is not being enforced at the moment, thanks to several lower court rulings that prevent prosecutors from bringing cases. But abortion rights opponents have appealed those decisions.The goal of the abortion rights amendment is to settle these questions once and for all, so that neither judges nor lawmakers could take away abortion access in Michigan. And that idea appears to have a great deal of support.In July, organizers submitted petitions supporting the amendment with more than 750,000 signatures from across the state. That was nearly twice as many as necessary, and consistent with the strong support for abortion rights among Michiganders that recent polling has detected.But opponents of the measure said those petitions were not valid, because of what was basically a series of typos: Spaces between some of the words were not readily visible, thanks to a glitch in the printing. This made the petitions incomprehensible, opponents claimed, and thus not valid as proof the amendment had enough support to qualify for the ballot.Last week, that argument prevailed with the two Republicans who sit on Michigan\u2019s four-person election board. The two Republicans voted against authorizing the amendment, producing a deadlock along party lines. If that had been the final word, the amendment would not be on the November ballot.But immediately after the elections board voted, the amendment\u2019s supporters asked the state Supreme Court to intervene, arguing that the meaning of the amendment was clear even with the compressed words \u2015 and that the elections board had no authority to block an initiative when it so clearly had enough public support.On Thursday, the court agreed that the amendment\u2019s meaning was clear, and ordered the election board to certify the amendment. The board next meets on Friday, which is also the deadline for county clerks to finalize November ballot designs.The vote on the seven-member court was 5-2, and in a brief, unsigned opinion, the majority explained that \u201cthe meaning of the words has not changed by the alleged insufficient spacing between them.\u201dBut several justices chimed in with more thoughts \u2015 including Chief Justice Bridget Mary McCormack, who was part of the majority and wrote a stinging concurring opinion.\u201cSeven hundred fifty three thousand and seven hundred fifty nine Michiganders signed this proposal \u2015 more than have ever signed any proposal in Michigan\u2019s history,\u201d McCormack wrote.Noting that the challengers produced no evidence that any voters were actually confused by the wording, McCormack accused those opponents of trying to \u201cdisenfranchise millions of Michiganders ... because they think they have identified a technicality that allows them to do so, a game of gotcha gone very bad.\u201dJustice Brian Zahra, one of the two dissenters, had some pointed words of his own. He protested the decision to issue a ruling without oral argument, then zeroed in on the substantive dispute \u2015 and why, in his opinion, it mattered.\u201cThe only thing more difficult to discern than the disputed portions of the text of the amendment is why the proponents of the amendment proceeded to circulate a petition that plainly did not conform to the form and content of the petition preapproved by the Bureau of Elections,\u201d Zahra wrote.The amendment\u2019s placement on the ballot could have a significant effect on the outcome of other races, by increasing turnout among voters who support abortion rights.That is likely to help candidates who also support abortion rights \u2015 including incumbent Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) and Attorney General Dana Nessel (D), both of whom are up for reelection and have made abortion a central focus of their campaigns.It could also help Democrats seeking U.S. House seats, including several in tightly contested races whose outcomes could effectively determine which party controls the chamber starting in January.The caveat is that the polls could be wrong: The amendment might not be as popular as it seems. Or sentiments could change as opponents hammer away at it.If that happens, then the amendment could fail and its supporters running for office could lose \u2015 which, in the case of the governor\u2019s race, would mean a victory for Republican Tudor Dixon.Dixon has said she supports the 1931 ban, including its lack of exceptions for rape and incest. If there\u2019s no new amendment in the state constitution and she\u2019s the one in the governor\u2019s office, then abortion might not be legal in Michigan for much longer.Senior National Correspondent, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Among the plaintiffs is Keith Martin, a 71-year-old a Portland resident who has used a wheelchair since having a stroke three years ago.\u201cI couldn\u2019t get to my breakfast in the morning because there was a tent covering the whole sidewalk,\u201d Martin said. \u201cI was forced onto the street and narrowly missed a streetcar that came around the corner.\u201dOregon\u2019s homelessness crisis has been fueled by a housing shortage, the coronavirus pandemic and high drug addiction rates. Federal data from the latest National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that 9% of teens and adults in Oregon had illicit drug use disorders in 2020. That year, the state also ranked last in access to drug addiction treatment, according to the survey.The class action suit seeks to require the city to clear all sidewalks of tent encampments and debris, and to \u201cconstruct, purchase, or otherwise provide for emergency shelters in which to house the unsheltered persons\u201d who may be affected.Such measures would make sidewalks accessible for people with disabilities in a safe manner while providing a safe place for unhoused people, DiLorenzo said.Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler\u2019s office said the mayor is meeting with the city attorney before providing comment.About 13% of Portlanders live with a disability, according to the lawsuit, including 6% with mobility impairments and 2.4% with visual impairments.Plaintiff Steve Jackson, 47, is legally blind and uses a cane to walk. He said tents prevent him from navigating the sidewalk and accessing bus stops.\u201cOften there\u2019s tents blocking the entire sidewalk, where I don\u2019t see them because they weren\u2019t there the day before, and I hit the tent and then people are mad at me and think I\u2019m attacking them,\u201d Jackson said during a news conference.There were about 3,000 unsheltered people living in Multnomah County, home to Portland, during the most recent point-in-time count in January 2022, county figures show.The Portland City Council declared a state of emergency on homelessness in 2015 and has extended it five times since then. The measure, now set to expire in 2025, reduces the bureaucratic hurdles surrounding the creation of homeless shelters.Despite the city\u2019s years-long emergency measure, the estimated number of people experiencing homelessness spiked 25% in the Portland area between 2020 and 2022, according to point-in-time counts reported to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.This year alone, Wheeler has issued four emergency declarations to address homelessness issues. Most recently in August, he expanded a previous declaration that prohibits camping along high-speed corridors such as highways to include key walking routes to K-12 schools.The state has wrestled with a debate over the best way to reduce homelessness. Some business groups have called for more encampment sweeps and stricter enforcement of anti-camping ordinances, while others want more investment in social services and affordable housing.Oregon lawmakers earlier this year approved a budget that includes $400 million to address homelessness and housing.____Claire Rush is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostDespite making up 25% of the global population, Muslims only account for 1% of characters on popular television shows, according to a report released Wednesday.The findings, which come from an analysis of 200 top-rated television shows aired in the U.S., U.K., Australia and New Zealand between 2018 and 2019, indicate yet again that the global entertainment industry has either sidelined Muslim voices entirely or cast Muslim actors in roles rooted in stereotypes. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is content creators and casting directors that have no imagination,\u201d said Stacy Smith, the founder of the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative and the lead author of the study.\u201cThis is people being lazy with a group of people that routinely are being dehumanized as either perpetrators or victims of violence, or with disparaging comments.\u201dSuch storylines can contribute to a host of concerns in the real world, including aggression toward and fear of Muslims, Smith said.The report, titled \u201cErased or Extremists: The Stereotypical View of Muslims in Popular Episodic Series,\u201d was released with support from the USC initiative, Pillars Fund and the Ford Foundation, as well as actor Riz Ahmed and his production company, Left Handed Films.Among the shows review as part of the study, 87% did not feature a single Muslim character. The 200 scripted series included just 98 Muslim characters out of 8,885 speaking roles \u2014 a ratio of about 1-to-90.When Muslim characters did make an appearance on screen, they were largely portrayed as violent or foreign, and referred to with words like \u201cterrorist,\u201d \u201cpredator\u201d and \u201cmonster.\u201d Thirty percent of the Muslim characters in the sample perpetrated violent acts against another character, and nearly 40% were targets of violence.Despite the fact that Muslims are the most racially and ethnically diverse religious group in the world, the majority of speaking Muslim characters were depicted as Middle Eastern or North African. Only 13% of all Muslim characters were shown as native to countries that are not majority Muslim. Meanwhile, two were depicted as immigrants.Of all the speaking Muslim characters in the scripted series, about 70% were male and 30% were female. Muslim girls and women on screen typically faced some sort of distress, including emotional duress or physical danger. \u201cWe didn\u2019t see them really leading their own storylines or showing them in empowering roles \u2014 which, again, creates this light that Muslim women cannot be leaders and they cannot be empowered,\u201d said Al-Baab Khan, one of the authors of the study.She said such depictions are harmful because they reinforce the image of Muslim women \u201cas being oppressed, as being fearful or as being less-than, which is not true.\u201dA separate study released by the same researchers last year found that fewer than 2% of movie characters with speaking roles were Muslim.\u201cWe see that even across all media content in film and TV ... Muslims are extremely erased on screen. And that poses a huge issue because when we think about Muslims in the real world, we make up a quarter of the world\u2019s population,\u201d Khan said.\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to even justify such a disproportionate representation on screen. And it\u2019s really sad because growing up in America, you want to be able to see your own community.\u201dThe issue isn\u2019t unique to Muslims. Hollywood has long faced criticism for its abysmal track record on diversity and the lack of Black, Asian, Hispanic and Latino actors in lead roles. Pillars, which issues financial grants to Muslim groups, put up a billboard in Los Angeles ahead of next week\u2019s Primetime Emmy Awards to highlight data from the new report and start an overdue conversation about the lack of Muslim representation in the industry.\u201cWe wanted to use Emmy Award season to have folks consider something else, which is that the quantity and quality of characters on screen has a huge impact on the daily lived experiences of Muslims around the globe,\u201d said Arij Mikati, the managing director of culture change at Pillars.But for decades, she said, television has not included the \u201cbeauty, joy, diversity, and richness of our communities and Muslim communities.\u201d\u201cRepresentation for representation\u2019s sake is certainly not our goal. The quality and content of characters on screen have a really massive impact on how people all around the world feel about Muslims and also how Muslims feel about themselves,\u201d she added.\u201cFilm can act as a way for audiences to identify with Muslims, and I really believe it\u2019s an opportunity to create greater empathy for and less prejudice towards Muslims off-screen.\u201dShows depicting Muslim lead characters with nuance are slowly becoming more common.\u201cMs. Marvel,\u201d which features the first Muslim superhero in Marvel Studios\u2019 \u201ccinematic universe,\u201d debuted on Disney+ earlier this year and quickly became one of the production company\u2019s highest-rated projects.Meanwhile, Netflix\u2019s \u201cMo\u201d \u2014 based on the life of Muslim comedian Mo Amer \u2014 documents the story of a Palestinian refugee in Houston. And last year, the British sitcom \u201cWe Are Lady Parts,\u201d which follows a punk band made up of Muslim women, premiered on Peacock.\u201cWe know that people are hungry for those stories. They are unique and relatable, and we\u2019re really excited to invite other Americans to learn more about our vibrant communities,\u201d Mikati said. \u201cThis is an opportunity for the industry to see the talent that has long existed in abundance.\u201dReporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostNo one knows exactly when the next recession will happen, but layoff victims will certainly fall into a safety net that is weaker than ever. After Congress turbocharged jobless benefits in response to the coronavirus pandemic, lawmakers in three states have already slashed the state-funded benefits that are the foundation of the unemployment insurance system. Lawmakers at the federal level, meanwhile, have lost all appetite for improving the system even after the pandemic exposed its flaws on a national scale. And it\u2019s hard to imagine Congress stepping in with another temporary expansion of benefits as Republicans continue to blame high inflation on the extra benefits Democrats approved last year. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen incredible gridlock in Congress to pass things that are overwhelmingly popular with the public, like the $15 minimum wage,\u201d Rebecca Dixon, director of the National Employment Law Project, told HuffPost. \u201cI think we could get to a place where there is a crisis and Congress can\u2019t get out of gridlock and address it.\u201dIn response to every recession since the 1950s, Congress has added additional weeks of benefits to the standard 26 provided by states. After lawmakers temporarily added 73 weeks of benefits in the wake of the Great Recession, Republicans in 10 states permanently cut the duration of their underlying state programs.The give-and-take pattern ramped up with the coronavirus pandemic. Congress added weeks of benefits in 2020 and also took the unprecedented steps of temporarily boosting the weekly value of benefits by $600 and expanding eligibility to include workers without traditional payroll jobs, such as rideshare drivers.Republican governors in 25 states then took the unprecedented step of rejecting extra federal benefits in 2021. State legislatures in 10 states also took up bills cutting benefits, according to Andrew Stettner, director of workforce policy at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank. \u201cThere was some bad activity last session and we expect some of these states will come back for more,\u201d Stettner said in an email. Only Iowa, Kentucky and Oklahoma permanently cut benefits in the last legislative session. Kentucky\u2019s new law also imposed stricter work search requirements; Iowa\u2019s requires unemployment recipients to accept jobs at lower wages. Iowa Republican state representative Michael Bousselot said the safety net should be less of a safety net and more of a trampoline that bounces layoff victims back into jobs. \u201cWhat we are proposing to do is to refocus unemployment on \u2018re-employment,\u2019 rather than just being a safety net,\u201d Bousselot said in March. Republicans at the state and federal levels blamed extra benefits for causing a \u201cworker shortage\u201d in 2021, but businesses have continued to complain of worker shortages long after the supplemental benefits disappeared. One of the most important changes Congress made in 2020 allowed the self-employed and independent contractors, such as Uber drivers, to apply for benefits for the first time in the history of the state-federal unemployment insurance system. The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program paid workers who were ineligible for regular unemployment because they didn\u2019t have a history of payroll earnings on file with their state government. A Bloomberg investigation showed that in the first year of the pandemic, Black workers in Georgia were more likely than their white counterparts to be denied regular benefits; the special pandemic benefits helped close some of the gap in benefits coverage. But the program might be better known for fraud than for reducing racial disparities.\u201cIt\u2019s so hard to bring attention to this program when there\u2019s not a crisis.\u201dProgressive Democrats want to reform the unemployment system so that it covers nontraditional workers, reduces variation among states and stops states from slashing benefits. And they want to upgrade out-of-date information technology used by many state workforce agencies. Some workers had to wait several months for benefits due to the strain an unprecedented surge in claims put on antiquated state systems.But Democrats omitted the proposals even from the most expansive version of the domestic policy bill they wound up whittling down and passing last month as the Inflation Reduction Act. There\u2019s no hope of its return in the immediate future. Dixon said it would likely take another crisis to create a window of opportunity for Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to bring attention to this program when there\u2019s not a crisis,\u201d she said. Many economists expect a recession and widespread job losses sometime in the next year as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates in order to tame inflation by slowing the overall economy. Job growth has remained strong, but there are potential warning signs. Matt Darling, an employment policy fellow at the Niskanen Center, a center-right think tank, has pointed to widening gaps between the unemployment rates for college-educated workers and those with no higher education, as well as between white workers and Black workers. Two of the numbers I track closely are the gaps between college and non-college educated workers, and the gap between black and white workers.Both are sharply up right now, which is concerning. #BeyondTheNumbers https://t.co/nxdD9uxhHX pic.twitter.com/WnDLiAeSSy\u201cIf we are seeing the effects of the Federal Reserve\u2019s [rate hikes], these are the places we\u2019d expect to see them first,\u201d Darling said in an interview. It\u2019s possible that the widening gaps represent \u201cnoise\u201d in the data, but it could be that layoffs have begun to increase for the more vulnerable members of the American workforce.Dixon said she didn\u2019t think a recession caused by interest rate hikes would be as bad as the one caused by the pandemic or the one caused by the financial crisis more than a decade earlier. But she does expect a familiar pattern in who gets hurt the most.\u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019ll necessarily be widespread pain from the recession, if we have one in the near term, but there will be pain,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the people who experience the most pain are also the ones who are most likely to be locked out of the UI system.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

At a press conference before the premiere, Styles was peppered with questions about his fans, his career and whether or not he would work with director Olivia Wilde again \u2014 neither of which he answered.In \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling,\u201d Styles plays Jack, who works for the mysterious Victory Project, run by Chris Pine\u2019s charismatic cult-like leader, in a mid-century-styled experimental community. Florence Pugh plays Jack\u2019s wife Alice, who gets every comfort in the world in exchange for not asking questions. But soon, she starts to see cracks in the veneer.\u201cI think it\u2019s fun to get to play in worlds that aren\u2019t necessarily your own. This world that is supposedly so perfect, it\u2019s really fun to play pretend in there,\u201d Styles said. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t too much acting.\u201dStyles took several days off from his Madison Square Garden appearances to attend the \u201cDon\u2019t Worry Darling\u201d premiere in Venice, with Wilde and co-stars Pine and Gemma Chan. But though he juggles two high-profile careers in the arts, he said he doesn\u2019t see many parallels between music and acting.\u201cPersonally I find them to be kind of opposite in a lot of ways. I think making music is a really personal thing,\u201d Styles said. \u201cThere\u2019s aspects of acting where you\u2019re drawing from experiences you\u2019ve had but for the most part you\u2019re pretending to play someone else. I think that\u2019s what I find the most fun about it: playing pretend.\u201dHe added: \u201cI think the fun part is you never know what you\u2019re doing. Music I\u2019ve done for longer, but what I like about acting is I feel like I have no idea what I\u2019m doing.\u201dFans were already gathering in front of the theater early Monday to get a prime perch in front of the red carpet for the premiere, hours in advance. Many had personal stories about how Styles\u2019 music impacted their lives.\u201cI\u2019m incredibly grateful to the people who\u2019ve supported me in my life and the fans in particular have always provided me with a place to be myself and feel comfortable doing so and express myself,\u201d he said about what it\u2019s like to mean so much to so many people. \u201cI would like to hope I can give that space back to them.\u201dBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "UVALDE, Texas (AP) \u2014 Elsa Avila slid to her phone, terrified as she held the bleeding side of her abdomen and tried to stay calm for her students. In a text to her family that she meant to send to fellow Uvalde teachers, she wrote: \u201cI\u2019m shot.\u201dFor the first time in 30 years, Avila will not be going back to school as classes resume Tuesday in the small, southwest Texas city. The start of school will look different for her, as for other survivors of the May 24 shooting at Robb Elementary School in which 21 people died, with an emphasis on healing, both physically and mentally. Some have opted for virtual education, others for private school. Many will return to Uvalde school district campuses, though Robb Elementary itself will never reopen.\u201cI\u2019m trying to make sense of everything,\u201d Avila said in an August interview, \u201cbut it is never going to make sense.\u201dA scar down her torso brings her to tears as a permanent reminder of the horror she endured with her 16 students as they waited in their classroom for an hour for help while a gunman slaughtered 19 children and two teachers in two adjoining classrooms nearby.Minutes before she felt the sharp pain of the bullet piercing her intestine and colon, Avila was motioning students away from the walls and windows and closer to her. A student lined up by the door for recess had just told her something was going on outside: People were running \u2014 and screaming. As she slammed the classroom door so the lock would catch, her students took their well-practiced lockdown positions.Moments later, a gunman stormed into their fourth-grade wing and began spraying bullets before ultimately making his way into rooms 111 and 112.In room 109, Avila repeatedly texted for help, according to messages reviewed by The Associated Press. First at 11:35 a.m. in the text to her family that she says was meant for the teacher group chat. Then at 11:38 in a message to the school\u2019s vice principal. At 11:45, she responded to a text from the school\u2019s counselor asking if her classroom was on lockdown with: \u201cI\u2019m shot, send help.\u201d And when the principal assured her that help was on the way, she replied simply: \u201cHelp.\u201d\u201cYes they are coming,\u201d the principal wrote back at 11:48 a.m.It\u2019s unclear whether her messages were relayed to police. District officials did not respond to requests for comment on actions taken to communicate with law enforcement on May 24, and an attorney for then-Principal Mandy Gutierrez was not available for comment.According to a legislative committee\u2019s report that described a botched police response, nearly 400 local, state and federal officers stood in the hallway of the fourth-grade wing or outside the building for 77 minutes before some finally entered the adjoining classrooms and killed the gunman. Lawmakers also found a relaxed approach to lockdowns \u2014 which happened often \u2014 and security concerns, including issues with door locks. State and federal investigations into the shooting are ongoing.The district is working to complete new security measures, and the school board in August fired the district\u2019s police chief, Pete Arredondo. Residents say it remains unclear how \u2014 or even if \u2014 trust between the community and officials can be rebuilt, even as some call for more accountability, better police training and stricter gun safety laws.Avila recalls hearing the ominous bursts of rapid fire, then silence, then the voices of officers in the hallway yelling, \u201cCrossfire!\u201d and later more officers standing nearby.\u201cBut still nobody came to help us,\u201d she said.As Avila lay motionless, unable to speak loud enough to be heard, some of her students nudged and shook her. She wished for the strength to tell them she was still alive.A light flashed into their window, but nobody identified themselves. Scared it might be the gunman, the students moved away.\u201cThe little girls closest to me kept patting me and telling me, \u2018It\u2019s going to be OK miss. We love you miss,\u2019\u201d Avila said.Finally, at 12:33 p.m. a window in her classroom broke. Officers arrived to evacuate her students \u2014 the last to be let out in the area, according to Avila.With her remaining strength, Avila pulled herself up and helped usher students onto chairs and tables and through the window. Then, clutching her side, she told an officer she was too weak to jump herself. He came through the window to pull her out.\u201cI never saw my kids again. I know they climbed out the window and I could just hear them telling them, `Run, run, run!\u2019\u201d Avila said.She remembers being taken to the airport, where a helicopter flew her to a San Antonio hospital. She was in and out of care until June 18.Avila later learned that a student in her class was wounded by shrapnel to the nose and mouth but had since been released from medical care. She said other students helped their injured classmates until officers arrived.\u201cI am very proud of them because they were able to stay calm for a whole hour that we were in there terrified,\u201d Avila said.As her students prepare to return to school for the first time since that traumatic day, Avila is on the way to recovery, walking up to eight minutes at a time on the treadmill in physical therapy and going to counseling. She looks forward to teaching again someday.Outside of a shuttered Robb Elementary, a memorial for the people killed overflows at the entrance gate. Teachers from across Texas stopped by this summer to pay their respects and reflect on what they would do in the same situation.\u201cIf I survive, I have to make sure they survive first,\u201d said Olga Oglin, an educator of 23 years from Dallas, her voice breaking.\u201cWhatever happens to a student at our school, it just happens to one of my kids,\u201d Olgin said, adding that as the person to greet parents, students and staff at the door in the mornings, she likely would be the first person shot.Ofelia Loyola, who teaches elementary school in San Antonio, visited with her husband, middle school teacher Raul Loyola. She was baffled at the delayed response from law enforcement, as seen on security and police video.\u201cThey are all kids. It doesn\u2019t matter how old they are, you protect them,\u201d she said.Last week, Avila and several of her students met for the end-of-year party they were unable to have in May. They played in the pool at a country club and she gave them each a bracelet with a little cross to remind them that \u201cGod was with us that day and they are not alone,\u201d she said.\u201cWe always talked about being kind, being respectful, taking care of each other \u2014 and they were able to do that on that day,\u201d Avila said.\u201cThey took care of each other. They took care of me.\u201d___This story was updated to correct that Uvalde is in southwest Texas, not in the state\u2019s southeast.___More on the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas: https://apnews.com/hub/uvalde-school-shooting\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 The Republican candidate for governor in Wisconsin endorsed by Donald Trump is calling for people to take up \u201cpitchforks and torches\u201d in reaction to a story that detailed his giving to anti-abortion groups, churches and others \u2014 rhetoric that Democrats say amounts to threatening violence.Tim Michels, who co-owns the state\u2019s largest construction company, faces Democratic Gov. Tony Evers in the battleground state. If Michels wins, he will be in position to enact a host of GOP priorities passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature leading into the 2024 presidential election. Evers has vetoed more bills than any governor in modern state history and is campaigning on his ability to serve as a check on Republicans.Michels, a multimillionaire, this week reacted strongly to a story published by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel detailing charitable giving by him and his wife\u2019s foundation, some of which went to anti-abortion groups and churches that have taken anti-gay positions.Since the story\u2019s publication, Michels has gone after not just Evers and Democrats, but also the Journal Sentinel and, more broadly, all reporters.\u201cI believe people should just, just be ready to get out on the streets with pitchforks and torches with how love the liberal media has become,\u201d Michels said Thursday on a conservative talk radio show.\u201cPeople need to decide: \u2018Am I going to put up with this? Am I going to tolerate this, taking somebody that gives money to churches or cancer research and use that as a hit piece in the media?\u2019 I\u2019m appalled. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201dThat\u2019s further than he went in a campaign website posting on Thursday when he encouraged people to \u201cGet involved. Push back. Speak up. Volunteer. Donate. Vote.\u201dEvers\u2019 spokesman, Sam Roecker, tweeted Friday that Michels had gone too far.\u201cInstead of explaining why he\u2019s funding groups working to ban access to abortion and contraception, Tim Michels is encouraging violence,\u201d Roecker wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s too radical for Wisconsin.\u201dHannah Menchoff, a Wisconsin Democratic Party spokesperson, accused Michels of threatening violence in an \u201cextreme attempt to pander to Donald Trump and the MAGA base.\u201dMichels\u2019 campaign spokesperson, Anna Kelly, on Friday downplayed his comments.\u201cOnly political hacks and media accomplices would freak out about Tim using a figure of speech to emphasize the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s ridiculous characterization of his donations to churches, nuns, and charitable causes as \u2018radical,\u2019\u201d she said.Michels, who has used the Journal Sentinel article in fundraising pleas, posted a lengthy response to the piece on his campaign website Thursday. He accused Evers and the \u201ccorrupt media\u201d of turning his charitable giving and faith \u201cinto something malicious.\u201d\u201cI will never, ever apologize for giving to charitable causes, or for being a Christian,\u201d Michels wrote. \u201cHowever, the Journal Sentinel should be ashamed of their anti-religious bigotry.\u201dMilwaukee Journal Sentinel executive editor George Stanley defended the article, noting that the paper ran a piece on the same day about security costs for the Democratic U.S. Senate candidate that his Republican opponent was urging people to read.\u201cMilwaukee Journal Sentinel reporters are independent of all political parties and special interest groups,\u201d Stanley said. \u201cWe are committed to accuracy so citizens can make up their own minds and stay in charge of their government.\u201dThe Timothy and Barbara Michels Family Foundation donated $1.66 million in 2020 alone, the Journal Sentinel reported. The bulk of it, $1 million, went to Cornell University in New York. where a faculty member pioneered a rare surgery that saved the life of Michels\u2019 daughter, who had a brain tumor at age 11.The Journal Sentinel published a story in March about that donation and the surgery that Michels\u2019 daughter had. That was one month before Michels announced his run for governor.Michels also gave $175,000 to Wisconsin Right to Life, Pro Life Wisconsin Education Task Force and Avail NYC, a New York City crisis pregnancy center.Pro Life Wisconsin wants to outlaw abortion and ban most common forms of contraception and birth control. It also wants to prohibit in vitro fertilization.The Michels\u2019 foundation also donated $10,000 to Christ Fellowship in Miami. The Journal Sentinel\u2019s story noted that the church\u2019s pastor, Omar Giritli, in June called arguments for exception to abortions in cases of rape or incest \u201cdeceptive reasoning.\u201dThe couple also donated $50,000 to Spring Creek Church in Pewaukee. Its pastor, Chip Bernhard, has suggested that people who have an abortion need forgiveness, and allowing transgender children to use the bathroom of their choice is \u201cawful.\u201dKelly, Michels\u2019 campaign spokesperson, did not immediately respond to questions about whether Michels supported those positions.Michels defended his giving to pregnancy resource centers, Wisconsin Right to Life and Pro Life Wisconsin, saying \u201cwe believe women who may feel overwhelmed by an unplanned pregnancy need and deserve compassion, love, support and options other than abortion.\u201cI apologize for none of it,\u201d Michels wrote.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Cipollone was the most senior member of the Trump administration inside the White House on Jan. 6, and attended meetings where the then-president and his allies strategized about overturning the 2020 election result.The news of their scheduled appearance was first reported by ABC News.Cipollone and Philbin had threatened to resign if Trump went ahead with his plan to install a loyalist as attorney general to look into his allegations of widespread election fraud in the 2020 presidential election.Marc Short, who served as Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff for two years, and Pence\u2019s counsel Greg Jacob have also provided testimony to the grand jury, according to The New York Times.Cipollone and his deputy have already appeared before the House select committee investigating the attacks on the U.S. Capitol for closed-door interviews.In excerpts from his interview aired during the committee\u2019s last public hearings, Cipollone can be heard admiting there was not sufficient election fraud to affect the outcome of the 2020 election. Cipollone also told the panel Trump should have conceded the election.Cassidy Hutchinson, a former aide to Trump\u2019s former chief of staff Mark Meadows, publicly testified that Cipollone did not want Trump to join his supporters at the Capitol on Jan. 6.\u201cPlease make sure we don\u2019t go up to the Capitol, Cassidy.

It is very important that everything that happened be preserved in these two centers.\u201dWhile Gorbachev didn\u2019t confirm how much he was paid, sources claimed he was reportedly paid nearly $1 million to do the advertisement, according to The New York Times. The commercial, which shows him dining at a Pizza Hut with his granddaughter Anastasia, debuted all over the world.However, in Russia Gorbachev was still unpopular at the time and the ad was not aired despite it being filmed in Moscow, The New York Times reported.Negotiations between Pizza Hut and Gorbachev took a bit of time because while he was willing to take the dough for the ad, he said \u201cnyet\u201d to eating the pizza on camera, according to reports.Hence, the casting of his granddaughter, who willingly chowed down on a slice to appease Pizza Hut executives, according to a 2019 deep dive into the commercial by Foreign Policy.Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, initially feared doing commercials would harm his reputation. But he ended up also doing a 2007 magazine ad for Louis Vuitton where he\u2019s sitting in a car next to remaining parts of the Berlin Wall.HuffPost reached out to Pizza Hut for comment, but no one immediately responded. Many Twitter users, on the other hand, had tons of saucy comments about Gorbachev\u2019s Pizza Hut past.My generation knew Communism was dead when we saw Gorbachev in a Pizza Hut commercial.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostFederal prosecutors on Tuesday revealed more explosive information about how former President Donald Trump and his team repeatedly failed to hand over classified documents, and how they may have even sought to obstruct the criminal investigation into the matter.How are members of his party responding to the government? By choosing to simply ignore the documents. A Twitter account run by the office of Rep. Jim Jordan (Ohio), the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, mocked a new photo prosecutors provided of some classified documents recovered at Trump\u2019s estate because it included a box of framed Time magazine covers that featured Trump.That TIME Magazine cover was huge threat to national security. \ud83d\ude44 https://t.co/yy0AOmxMEhRepublicans on the House Judiciary Committee glossed over the documents marked \u201ctop secret,\u201d which contain the most sensitive types of information, including some items related to the work of clandestine U.S. intelligence sources. The Department of Justice said that during the Aug. 8 search of Trump\u2019s estate, in some instances, \u201ceven FBI counterintelligence personnel and DOJ attorneys conducting the review required additional clearances before they were permitted to review certain documents.\u201dBut House Judiciary Republicans found this all much ado about nothing. The FBI agents, they claimed in a follow-up tweet, staged a \u201cphoto op\u201d and took the Time magazine covers \u201cas a souvenir.\u201dWhile other GOP lawmakers stayed silent immediately following the filing of DOJ\u2019s brief late Tuesday night, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem (R) suggested the FBI was either lying or had somehow planted the documents at Trump\u2019s estate \u2015 a favorite conspiracy theory among conservatives. \u201cYou can see folders, you can see big words on \u2015 do we know that that is really what President Trump brought to his home? Do we know that he put them there? Do we know what\u2019s inside?\u201d Noem posited in a Wednesday morning interview on Fox News. Noem is viewed as a potential 2024 presidential candidate and has already made several trips to early nominating states. These are only the latest GOP contortions in defense of Trump\u2019s refusal to return classified documents to the government in potential violation of the Espionage Act. GOP lawmakers previously suggested that FBI agents went rogue during the search, that maybe aliens had something to do with it, and that the secrets weren\u2019t that secret at all. And then there are their attempts to deflect by pointing to Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server. Trump on Wednesday claimed he \u201cdeclassified\u201d all of the documents found at his estate despite the fact that his own lawyers never said anything had been declassified during their months of negotiations with the government over the handling of the documents prior to the Aug. 8 search, per the Department of Justice. The former president also criticized how FBI agents presented the classified documents he kept at his estate in the photo the government provided on Tuesday.\u201cTerrible the way the FBI, during the Raid of Mar-a-Lago, threw documents haphazardly all over the floor (perhaps pretending it was me that did it!), and then started taking pictures of them for the public to see,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site, Truth Social.Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Prosecutors with the Justice Department filed a 36-page brief late Tuesday detailing the sensitive documents found at Mar-a-Lago, as well as efforts by the former president and his team to obstruct their criminal investigation.Prosecutors included an image of some of the documents discovered when the FBI executed a search warrant at Trump\u2019s residence. The photo shows five yellow folders on the floor marked top secret, as well as another that says \u201cSecret SCI,\u201d which means sensitive compartmentalized information.

A Monday filing from Digital World said voting for a yearlong delay in the merger would open Tuesday. The current deadline to take Trump Media public is Sept. 8, but Digital World has warned that it could be forced to liquidate if the deadline is not extended. The company noted in an earlier filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it lost $6.5 million in the first half of the year.The latest development follows news that Truth Social is grappling with other money and trademark issues as Trump deals with various personal legal problems.RightForge, a major web-hosting operator, claimed last week that Truth Social owes some $1.6 million in contractually obligated payments, reported Fox Business.In another setback this month, Truth Social\u2019s application for a trademark was turned down. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office found that Trump\u2019s company name was \u201cconfusingly similar\u201d to other entities.Digital World, already being investigated by the SEC over business dealings, also delayed its earning report earlier this month and warned in a filing last week that a dip in Trump\u2019s popularity could hurt the business. The Washington Post has reported that Truth Social\u2019s U.S. audience has plunged to about 300,000 views a day, down from nearly 1.5 million when it launched.The site is largely a platform for Trump, with heavy censorship, researchers and critics have found. Detractors say users are better served on competing right-wing social media sites like Telegram, Parler and Gab where there is a greater sense of a developed community with more discussion.Trump has posted a number of messages on Truth Social calling all negative information about his company in the media \u201cfake news.\u201d He has also posted messages asking people to join the site.Trends Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPostSecret Service Assistant Director Tony Ornato, who was at the center of bombshell testimony about former President Donald Trump\u2019s alleged outbursts during the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, has stepped down from the federal agency.Ornato, who at one point also served as a White House political adviser to Trump, retired Monday \u201cin good standing after 25 years of devoted service,\u201d Kevin Helgert, a special agent at the Secret Service, confirmed in a statement to HuffPost.In a message to CNN, Ornato said he is leaving the agency to pursue a career in the private sector.\u201cI long-planned to retire and have been planning this transition for more than a year,\u201d he told the network.He did not provide any details about his next move but did say that he is not taking up a role with Trump or any of Trump\u2019s businesses.Ornato\u2019s departure follows Cassidy Hutchinson testifying in June that he personally told the former White House aide about witnessing Trump lunge at a Secret Service agent who refused the president\u2019s request to drive him to the Capitol during the 2021 insurrection.\u201cThe president said something to the effect of, I\u2019m the f-ing president, take me up to the Capitol now. To which [Secret Service agent Bobby Engel] responded, \u2018Sir, we have to go back to the West Wing,\u2019\u201d Hutchinson recalled Ornato telling her at the time.\u201cThe president reached up toward the front of the vehicle to grab at the steering wheel. Mr. Engel grabbed his arm and said, \u2018Sir, you need to take your hand off the steering wheel, we\u2019re going back to the West Wing. We\u2019re not going to the Capitol,\u2019\u201d Hutchinson continued. \u201cMr. Trump then used his free hand to lunge towards Bobby Engel and when Ornato had recounted the story to me, he had motioned towards his clavicles.\u201dHutchinson\u2019s testimony came amid a yearslong investigation by a House select committee into the attack on the Capitol and efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.Ornato, a longtime Secret Service agent, took a break from his work with the law enforcement body in 2019 to serve as deputy chief of staff for operations at the White House. In this role, which he held for approximately a year, he helped organize Trump\u2019s political rallies and an infamous photo-op in which the then-president held a Bible outside the White House.This switch from serving as a protective agent to politics was unprecedented at the time. His eventual return to the Secret Service in late 2020 to oversee training would raise questions about agents\u2019 ability to loyally protect then-incoming President Joe Biden due to any political alignments with Trump.Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The teaser promises a sit-down with co-founder Nancy Salzman, who helped run the purported self-help group and was sentenced to three and a half years in prison. \u201cImagine you spent 22 years trying to build something, but everybody thinks it\u2019s the devil\u2019s work,\u201d says Salzman in the trailer. Directed once again by Jehane Noujaim, the second season seems to hint at exclusive access to various disgraced members, possibly including Raniere himself, who encouraged the documentarians to \u201ctalk to me\u201d in a chilling voice recording from prison in the finale\u2019s closing moments.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Politics Reporter, HuffPostSixteen years ago, amid a pitched battle to become Florida\u2019s governor, Charlie Crist unleashed a scathing TV ad highlighting the absenteeism of his opponent, then-Rep. Jim Davis (D), showing an empty office chair rolling past Washington landmarks.After the chair passes the Capitol, the Jefferson Memorial and the Washington Monument, the narrator asks, \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t show up for work now, why should we elect him governor?\u201d Crist, then a Republican, won by 7 percentage points.Almost two decades later, Crist, now a Democrat, has perfected something Davis could only dream about: being in two places at once, at least on paper.That\u2019s because of the U.S. House\u2019s continued use of proxy voting, in which lawmakers allow other lawmakers to cast their vote while they\u2019re absent. Crist used proxy voting to vote for the Inflation Reduction Act in mid-August, even as he had a full schedule of get-out-the-vote events set for the next day in Florida.With the heart of the midterm campaign season looming in September, Crist\u2019s case shows a tempting use of proxy voting for something other than public health: to allow lawmakers to skip being in the House in favor of being on the campaign trail.And with proxies becoming more widely used since 2020, this fall could see a rise in absentee voting as lawmakers weigh the practical value of being in the House chamber \u2014 where votes are usually seen as predetermined \u2014 versus pressing the flesh back home.Technically, House members are only supposed to use proxy voting when they are \u201cphysically unable to attend proceedings in the House Chamber due to the ongoing public health emergency.\u201d It\u2019s part of a rules change that was passed in May 2020 to allow members to cast votes even if they could not be present due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But there is no procedure to verify a member\u2019s reason for using it and no limits on how often proxy voting can be used. Crist was by no means alone in voting by proxy on the climate and tax bill. House records indicate some 158 members, or more than a third of the entire House, declared they were unable to attend due to COVID-19 on that Friday in August.And while Crist may be a prolific user of proxy voting, he is by no means alone or even the biggest user on the campaign trail. That title may belong to Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who is running for the U.S. Senate and had given his proxy 42 times in the current Congress, as of late August, compared with Crist\u2019s 23.Crist\u2019s office did not return a request for comment about his use of proxy voting while Ryan said \u201cremote voting\u201d should be a permanent option. \u201cThe year is 2022, we can walk and chew gum at the same time, and members of Congress should be able to use the technology at our disposal to do our jobs while also meeting face-to-face with the people we serve, taking care of kids, and more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to be together. We need to be looking at each other. We need to be talking to each other.\u201dThe job of a member of Congress pays $174,000 a year, usually requires in-person attendance at the Capitol only three to four days a week, and comes with plenty of formal and informal perks. Perhaps that\u2019s why proxy voting hasn\u2019t been embraced by some members, including some of the old guard.\u201cThe body needs to be in the building,\u201d Rep. Frank Lucas, a 15-term Oklahoma Republican told HuffPost before lawmakers left for their August break.\u201cWe need to be together. We need to be looking at each other. We need to be talking to each other. And if you\u2019re not physically able to do that for a two-year period, then maybe you should assess whether you\u2019re a member or not,\u201d he said.Republicans have argued House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has kept extending the temporary allowance of proxy voting to make it easier for Democrats to win close legislative votes with their narrow three-member majority, and House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) has vowed to end the practice if Republicans take control after November\u2019s midterms.\u201cIf you think about it, that\u2019s the story of this Democrat majority. They will destroy our economy and mortgage your future, but can\u2019t be personally bothered to show up to make the trip to D.C. to do their jobs. What a disgrace,\u201d McCarthy said during the Inflation Reduction Act debate.But while Democrats have been much more open to using proxy voting, many Republicans have lost their initial wariness and begun to embrace it. One Republican, Rep. Brad Wenstrup (Ohio), was spotted at a Washington area airport only hours after attending a press conference at the Capitol but before the Inflation Reduction Act vote, in which he voted by proxy. According to Brookings Institute researchers, 144 of the then-213 House GOP members had used proxy voting at least once in the current Congress through December of 2021, a number that\u2019s likely grown since. On average, Republicans voted by proxy 29 times during that period, compared with 54 times for Democrats.Rep. Steny Hoyer (Md.), the second-ranking House Democrat, told reporters in July he sees a need for proxy voting, even as he thinks its use may need to be tightened to prevent abuse.\u201cI\u2019m not one of those that\u2019s lathered up about proxy voting,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pandemic\u2019s not over.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt, however, that people are using it for convenience, not health. On both sides of the aisle,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cWe need to deal with it so we have a policy that is a rational one but also one that lets people be heard when they\u2019re sick or something, or when their family members are sick.\u201d\u201cSo it will only be in September that it will get bad, before the election.\u201dAs a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, Rep. Pete Sessions (Texas) has little doubt proxies will be used more this fall so members can keep campaigning. On the bright side, the House is already out of session until the second full week of September and is scheduled to be out for all of October.\u201cSo it will only be in September that it will get bad, before the election,\u201d he told HuffPost.Lucas, the Oklahoma Republican, said there are legitimate reasons to use proxy voting, and noted he used it himself after his wife had hip replacement surgery.But he warned about human nature.\u201cMembers of Congress are no different than normal people. Given an inch, most people will take a foot,\u201d he said.Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and other close associates of the men during \u201cmultiple\u201d trips and at various Mar-a-Lago functions, reported the Post-Gazette, which uncovered the story with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project.PG INVESTIGATION: Meet the 33-year-old woman who, while claiming to be a Rothschild, infiltrated Mar-a-Lago and former President Donald Trump's entourage.Now she's a subject of a widening FBI investigation.\u201cHow did they allow this?\u201dhttps://t.co/fV4Bsh7LTs\u201cIt was the near-perfect ruse and she played the part,\u201d John LeFevre, a former investment banker who met her with other guests around a club pool, told the newspaper.Yashchyshyn, 33, demonstrated \u201cthe ease with which someone with a fake identity and shadowy background\u201d could slip through security at Trump\u2019s club, \u201cone of America\u2019s power centers and the epicenter of Republican Party politics,\u201d noted the Post-Gazette.The FBI has obtained several records linked to Yashchyshyn as part of its investigation, including copies of two fake passports from the U.S. and Canada, the Post-Gazette reported. Investigators reportedly also have a Florida driver\u2019s license belonging to \u201cAnna de Rothschild\u201d with the address of a $13 million Miami Beach mansion where Yashchyshyn has never lived.No other details of the investigation were available, and Yashchyshyn could not be reached for comment.It wasn\u2019t until March of this year that members of Trump\u2019s entourage realized Yashchyshyn was an imposter, the Post-Gazette and OCCRP reported.In 2019, a Chinese woman with two different passports and who was loaded down with electronic equipment managed to slip past a Secret Service agent by saying she was headed to the Mar-a-Lago pool.Yujing Zhang received an eight-month prison sentence and was deported to China after being convicted of trespassing and lying to Secret Service agents.FBI officials early this month seized several boxes of White House material from Mar-a-Lago, including classified documents and some top-secret information that is so sensitive it\u2019s only supposed to be viewed in a secure government facility.Check out the full story by OCCRP and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.Trends Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Trends Reporter, HuffPostAttorneys for former President Donald Trump have filed an updated motion regarding the FBI\u2019s confiscation of government documents from his Mar-a-Lago estate after a judge ordered them to restructure it.The 12-page motion, filed in a federal court in Florida on Friday night, asks for the appointment of a neutral \u201cSpecial Master\u201d to review the documents taken from Trump\u2019s resort earlier this month to determine if any may be protected by executive privilege.The filing was characterized as \u201csupplemental\u201d to an initial motion presented earlier this week. It was newly filed on the same day that another court released the affidavit supporting the FBI\u2019s Aug. 8 search.Friday night\u2019s motion does not mention the hundreds of pages of classified documents seized during the search and other visits by investigators, Politico noted.It also fails to mention Trump\u2019s insistence that he declassified all the material before it was taken from the White House \u2014 a claim that he and ally Kash Patel, the former chief of staff to Trump\u2019s acting defense secretary, have made repeatedly.The motion cites a 1991 court decision concerning electronic communication, which determined that neither Congress nor the National Archives can \u201cveto\u201d a sitting president\u2019s \u201cdisposal decision\u201d regarding official records.The judgment doesn\u2019t, however, address issues concerning former presidents, nor does it say anything about certain legal violations around stashing White House records without the proper authority, Politico pointed out.Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon on Tuesday criticized the original motion for failing to answer several of her questions and gave attorneys until Friday to answer them. She even supplied a link to a \u201csample motion\u201d that they could consult.The boxes that FBI agents took from Mar-a-Lago this month included 11 packets of classified material, some of it top secret. Under the Presidential Records Act of 1978, such documents must be turned over to the National Archives when a president leaves office.Several legal experts appeared unimpressed with the updated motion.In a tweet, appellate attorney Ted Boutrous called it \u201cVery weak.\u201d\u201cThe crux of this motion\u2014a request for a special master to keep materials subject to executive privilege away from the Executive Branch\u2014remains nonsensical,\u201d tweeted former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti. \u201cAnd even if this motion is granted, it doesn\u2019t move the ball forward for Trump.\u201dVery weak, very moot https://t.co/uuchBxwQLAThe crux of this motion\u2014a request for a special master to keep materials subject to executive privilege away from the Executive Branch\u2014remains nonsensical.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPostThe sworn affidavit that prosecutors used to persuade a federal judge to let them search Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago home earlier this month says that classified documents would likely be found there as well as \u201cevidence of obstruction,\u201d according to a redacted version released Friday.\u201cThere is probable cause to believe that additional documents that contain classified NDI or that are Presidential records subject to record retention requirements currently remain at the PREMISES. There is also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found at the PREMISES,\u201d the heavily redacted, 38-page affidavit reads.NDI refers to National Defense Information \u2015 a category of documents considered highly sensitive.The Department of Justice\u2019s proposed redactions, and reasons for those redactions, were also released.The affidavit, filed by an FBI agent from the Washington, D.C., office with training in \u201ccounterintelligence and espionage investigations,\u201d says that the agency was brought in to investigate by the National Archives after officials there found that 15 boxes retrieved from Mar-a-Lago earlier this year included highly classified material.\u201cOf most significant concern was that highly classified records were unfoldered, intermixed with other records, and otherwise unproperly [sic] identified,\u201d the FBI agent wrote.The FBI did a preliminary review of the material in those boxes and found documents with classification markings in 14 out of the 15, the special agent wrote, describing the documents using a string of acronyms referring to classified material and \u201cFPOTUS\u201d for former President Trump:\u201cA preliminary triage of the documents with classification markings revealed the following approximate numbers: 184 unique documents bearing classification markings, including 67 documents marked as CONFIDENTIAL, 92 documents marked as SECRET, and 25 documents marked as TOP SECRET. Further, the FBI agents observed markings reflecting the following compartments/dissemination controls: HCS, FISA, ORCON, NOFORN, and SI. Based on my training and experience, I know that documents classified at these levels typically contain NDI. Several of the documents also contained what appears to be FPOTUS\u2019s handwritten notes.\u201dThe categories include HSC, which refers to \u201cintelligence information derived from clandestine human sources,\u201d and NOFORN, which means that material is not to be released to any foreign governments or nationals.The agent then quotes from a June 8 letter from the Department of Justice to Trump\u2019s lawyers that said the classified material was not being securely controlled.\u201cThey have not been handled in an appropriate manner or stored in an appropriate location. Accordingly, we ask that the room at Mar-a-Lago where the documents had been stored be secured and that all of the boxes that were moved from the White House to Mar-a-Lago (along with any other items in that room) be preserved in that room in their current condition until further notice,\u201d the letter read.Much of text of the affidavit is entirely blacked out to protect the names of investigators, witnesses and investigative techniques. The entirety of Pages 24 through 28 is just black lines, except for paragraph numbers and a subheading: \u201cThere is probable cause to believe that documents containing classified NDI and presidential records remain at the premises.\u201dDOJ prosecutors filed the redacted affidavit at the federal courthouse in West Palm Beach, Florida, late Friday morning after Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart ruled on Thursday that he had accepted the redactions prosecutors proposed to the affidavit as \u201cnarrowly tailored to serve the government\u2019s legitimate interest in the integrity of the ongoing investigation and are the least onerous alternative to sealing the entire affidavit.\u201dAn hour after the release of the affidavit, Trump posted another message on his social media network attacking the FBI, the Justice Department and the judge in the case.\u201cAffidavit heavily redacted!!! Nothing mentioned on \u2018Nuclear,\u2019 a total public relations subterfuge by the FBI & DOJ, or our close working relationship regarding document turnover - WE GAVE THEM MUCH. Judge Bruce Reinhart should NEVER have allowed the Break-In of my home,\u201d he wrote on Truth Social.The former president has publicly demanded the release of the unredacted affidavit but did not make that request in court.FBI agents searched Trump\u2019s tennis and social club in Palm Beach on Aug. 8 and took away boxes of material, including 11 packets of classified documents. Among that set was a batch labeled with the highest classification markings, meant for review only in secure government facilities.Trump, who had already been attacking the FBI and prosecutors for investigating his actions on and leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection has ramped up criticism of law enforcement since then.His followers have responded by threatening FBI agents and the Department of Justice, and one Trump supporter was killed in a shootout with police after he tried to attack the FBI\u2019s Cincinnati field office.In addition to the federal criminal investigations, a Georgia prosecutor is separately investigating Trump and his allies\u2019 attempts to coerce state officials into falsely declaring him the winner in that state.Trump, despite losing the election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College, became the first president in more than two centuries of elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol \u2014 his last-ditch attempt to remain in office \u2015 killed five, including one police officer, injured another 140 officers and led to four police suicides.Nevertheless, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024.In statements on his personal social media platform, Trump has continued to lie about the election and the House Jan. 6 committee\u2019s work, calling it a \u201choax\u201d similar to previous investigations into his 2016 campaign\u2019s acceptance of Russian assistance and his attempted extortion of Ukraine into helping his 2020 campaign.This is a developing story.

Trump has been using the platform much as he did with Twitter \u2014 to rail against enemies and complain he\u2019s being victimized.Last week, Digital World Acquisition Group, the special purpose acquisition company planning to merge with Truth Social to take it public on Wall Street, delayed its earnings report. The SPAC has been under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for possibly negotiating the merger deal before DWAC went public, which would violate the law.On Monday, Digital World warned in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that a dip in Trump\u2019s popularity could hurt the business.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 The judge presiding over a special grand jury that\u2019s investigating possible illegal attempts to influence the 2020 election in Georgia is wading into a fight over whether Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has to testify before the panel.Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who\u2019s supervising the special grand jury, scheduled a hearing for Thursday morning after a dispute between lawyers for the governor and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis\u2019 team of prosecutors escalated from tense emails to court filings in recent weeks.The increasingly heated rhetoric is playing out as the Republican governor, who is seeking reelection in the fall, seeks to avoid speaking to a special grand jury looking into whether former President Donald Trump and his allies broke any laws as they tried to overturn Trump\u2019s narrow election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Kemp\u2019s lawyers have accused Willis, a Democrat, of pursuing his testimony for \u201cimproper political purposes,\u201d an allegation the district attorney strongly denies.Willis\u2019 investigation was prompted by a January 2021 phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger during which the then-president suggested the state\u2019s top election official could \u201cfind\u201d the votes needed to overturn his loss.Raffensperger and some other state officials have already appeared before the special grand jury, but Kemp is one of a number of potential witnesses who are fighting orders to testify.U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., whose telephone calls to Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the election are of interest to prosecutors, was supposed to testify earlier this week, but a federal appeals court put that on hold while he fights his subpoena.A judge in Texas last week ordered Dallas-based lawyer and podcaster Jacki Pick to travel to Atlanta to testify, and her attempt to challenge that order was denied Tuesday by an appeals court. Pick, who\u2019s also known as Jacki Deason, gave a presentation before a Georgia legislative committee in December 2020 in which she alleged fraud by election workers at State Farm Arena in Atlanta.Willis has said she\u2019s considering summoning Trump himself to appear before the grand jury, a step that would surely set off a legal fight. The high-stakes investigation is one in a string of serious legal threats the former president is facing.Willis told Kemp attorney Brian McEvoy in a June email that she and her team wanted to ask the governor, among other things, about the call between Trump and Raffensperger. Trump also called Kemp in December 2020 asking him to order a special legislative session to secure the state\u2019s electoral votes for him.After an agreement to have the governor sit for a recorded interview fell apart, the district attorney\u2019s office got a subpoena to have the governor testify on Aug. 18, according to court filings. The day before he was to testify, Kemp\u2019s lawyers filed a motion to quash that subpoena.During Thursday\u2019s hearing, McBurney will determine whether Kemp has to abide by the subpoena.Kemp\u2019s lawyers argue that he is protected from testifying about his official duties by \u201csovereign immunity,\u201d a principle that says the state can\u2019t be sued without its consent. They also cited executive privilege, saying any material related to the governor\u2019s deliberative process and communications is protected. And they raised attorney-client privilege, saying the governor routinely sought advice from his office\u2019s attorneys in relation to the 2020 election and shouldn\u2019t have to testify about that.Willis\u2019 team has argued that sovereign immunity and executive privilege don\u2019t apply in this case and that they would avoid any topic that may be subject to attorney-client privilege.___Associated Press writer Jamie Stengle in Dallas contributed to this report.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostNEW YORK \u2015 With a slim lead over his nearest rival, Dan Goldman, the former federal prosecutor who led House Democrats\u2019 2019 impeachment case against then-President Donald Trump, declared victory on Tuesday evening in his race for the Democratic nomination in New York\u2019s 10th Congressional District.The primary election in the solidly Democratic seat has not been officially called by The Associated Press. \u201cThis has been an inspiring and humbling experience for a first-time candidate and to stand in front of you here today as your Democratic nominee for Congress,\u201d Goldman declared to cheering supporters at a brewery in Soho. \u201cAnd while we will appreciate and respect the democratic process and make sure that all the votes are counted, it is quite clear from the way that the results have come in that we have won.\u201dWhen Goldman made the announcement at 10:30 p.m., he had a lead of less than 2 percentage points over New York Assembly member Yuh-Line Niou. Niou announced around the same time that she would not concede in the race.\u201cI know that tonight\u2019s results aren\u2019t yet what we want to hear, but we will not concede until we count every vote,\u201d she told supporters.There may not be official results in the race for another week as outstanding absentee ballots are counted. In the Manhattan portion of the district, 10,679 people requested absentee ballots and just 3,881 had been returned as of Tuesday. And in the Brooklyn portion of the district, 10,823 people requested absentee ballots and just 3,968 had been returned.If a person returning an absentee ballot gets it postmarked by the Tuesday election day, it will still be eligible to be counted if it arrives by Aug. 30. With nearly 99% of the in-person ballots \u2015 and absentee ballots that have already arrived \u2015 counted, Goldman held a lead of just over 1,300 votes. That means there is technically a chance for Niou to win if there are a number of absentee ballots that come in in the coming days and they skew heavily toward Niou.Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), the five-term congressman who came in for criticism for trying to sneak into Afghanistan last year during the U.S. evacuation, won his party\u2019s primary election to succeed the retiring Sen. Jim Inhofe.Mullin, who owns a plumbing company in northeast Oklahoma, beat former state House Speaker T.W. Shannon to make it to the November ballot. He will face Democrat Kendra Horn, a former congresswoman from the Oklahoma City area, but the seat is considered safely Republican.In his five terms in the House, Mullin carved out a reputation as a defender of former President Donald Trump and a staunch critic of President Joe Biden.In a news conference with fellow Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee after the FBI\u2019s search of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida, Mullin asked why people should trust U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland.\u201cWhat has caused him to think that the American people should trust him? Is it the way that they handled Hillary Clinton\u2019s case with her emails? Is it the Russia collusion?\u201d he asked.Mullin also has bought into the false belief that Biden lost the 2020 election. In a televised debate with Shannon, Mullin said, \u201cIt\u2019s absurd to think that Joe Biden received more votes than any president in history. We have to fight to make sure every vote is counted accurately.\u201dBut Mullin may be best known for his actions in 2021 in the wake of the chaotic evacuation of U.S. troops and citizens from Afghanistan after the government fell surprisingly quickly to the fundamentalist Taliban. \u201cI\u2019m not Rambo. I never pretended to be Rambo.\u201dMullin tried to sneak into the country to help Americans who were trapped there and unable to get to the Kabul airport to evacuate. But his plan to hire a helicopter to fly into Afghanistan from neighboring Tajikistan went astray when a U.S. Embassy official in Tajikistan told the congressman he would not help him skirt limits on taking cash into the country, according to The Washington Post.Mullin defended himself against criticism he was showboating with the attempt, which included an Instagram post explaining he had gone radio silent for a few days and the hashtag #Ordinarypeopledoingextraordinarythings.\u201cI\u2019m not Rambo.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPostCharlie Crist on Tuesday won the Democratic nomination for Florida governor, giving him a second shot at the job he once held as a Republican.Crist easily defeated Nikki Fried, the sitting agriculture commissioner and currently the only Democrat in a statewide office, which now allows him to take on incumbent Gov. Ron DeSantis. The Florida Republican has spent recent months campaigning around the country as a prelude to a widely expected 2024 presidential run.Crist focused on that in the eight-minute victory speech he gave just 17 minutes after polls closed in the state\u2019s Panhandle counties located in the Central time zone. \u201cThis guy wants to be president of the United States, and everybody knows it. However, when we defeat him on Nov. 8, that show is over,\u201d he said to cheers. \u201cGov. DeSantis only cares about the White House. He doesn\u2019t care about your house.\u201dFried, who for much of the year-and-a-half primary campaign had lagged far behind in polling, seemed to gain momentum in recent weeks thanks to a surge of women voters angered by the U.S. Supreme Court striking down Roe v. Wade.That boost, though, proved ephemeral, as Democratic voters appeared to make a pragmatic decision about who would be best able to defeat DeSantis: Fried, who appealed the most to young and progressive voters, or Crist, preferred by older and more moderate Floridians.Crist won most of the state\u2019s large metro areas by two-to-one margins, including in Broward County, Fried\u2019s home base, and late Tuesday led statewide 60% to 35%.Four years earlier, Democrats picked the progressives\u2019 favorite, Andrew Gillum, over the more moderate Gwen Graham, only to see him lose narrowly to DeSantis in a strong year for Democrats.In his remarks Tuesday, Crist repeated a theme he hit often in the primary campaign: that he can create a coalition of voters, including moderate Republicans, who are turned off by DeSantis\u2019 aggressive style.\u201cWe can unite Democrats, independents, and many Republicans who care about our Florida, and we will defeat Ron DeSantis,\u201d he said.As he attempts to do this, though, Crist faces a steep climb.No sitting governor has lost reelection in Florida since 1990, and that only happened because Republican Bob Martinez was challenged by the immensely popular Lawton Chiles, who had already served three terms in the U.S. Senate.Crist also faces a staggering financial disadvantage heading into the general election just two and a half months away. Florida campaign finance records show that between his campaign and his political committee, Crist had just $1.5 million available to spend on Aug. 18, the close of the final pre-primary filing period, after having raised and spent a total of $15.2 million to defeat Fried.In contrast, DeSantis, who had no primary challenger, has a total of $132 million available to spend and is likely to raise many tens of millions more in the coming weeks.Whether Democrats in Florida and around the country will be willing to spend heavily on a long-shot race remains to be seen, particularly with winnable governor\u2019s races on the line in states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona.For Crist, meanwhile, Tuesday\u2019s win allows him a chance to end a losing streak of two statewide defeats in a row, starting with his failed U.S. Senate run in 2010, first as a Republican, then as an independent. He then lost a close race in 2014 as a Democrat trying to win back the governor\u2019s mansion that he had occupied from 2007-2011 as a Republican.Previously, in statewide races as a Republican, he lost a bid for U.S. Senate in 1998, won the education commissioner\u2019s job in 2000, and was elected state attorney general in 2002. He is currently a third-term Democratic congressman representing the St. Petersburg area.Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Responding to an increasing number of threats borne of conspiracy theories that agents were going to aggressively target middle income taxpayers, the Internal Revenue Service announced Tuesday that it was conducting a comprehensive review of safety at its facilities.The climate, healthcare and tax legislation signed into law by President Joe Biden last week included $80 billion in funding for tax collection efforts. Although Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen specifically directed the agency to not focus its attention on taxpayers with middle class incomes, misinformation spread rapidly on line that agents were going to crack down on taxpayers of all earnings levels.The baseless assertions also said the IRS would distribute firearms to employees authorized to used deadly force, prompting threats to the IRS employees.Now agency leadership has launched an examination of agency safety.\u201cWe are conducting a comprehensive review of existing safety and security measures,\u201d said Chuck Rettig, IRS commissioner about the agency\u2019s 600 office locations nationwide. \u201cThis includes conducting risk assessments,\u201d he said, by monitoring perimeter security, designations of restricted areas, exterior lighting, security around entrances of facilities and other measures.\u201cFor me this is personal. I\u2019ll continue to make every effort to dispel any lingering misperceptions about our work,\u201d Rettig said in a Tuesday letter to employees. \u201cAnd I will continue to advocate for your safety in every venue where I have an audience.\u201dRettig, whose term at the IRS ends in November, is tasked with developing a plan on how to spend the new infusion of funds included in the Inflation Reduction Act.Along with anonymous online forums, high-ranking Republican politicians have spread falsehoods about the IRS workforce and how the newly allocated funds would be spent.Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., sent an August 16 open letter to Americans, calling on them not to take any new IRS positions, reinforcing false information about open roles at the agency and their access to firearms.\u201cThe IRS is making it very clear that you not only need to be ready to audit and investigate your fellow hardworking Americans, your neighbors and friends, you need to be ready and, to use the IRS\u2019s words, willing, to kill them,\u201d he said in the letter.Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, said members have been vocal about their fears and worries about their safety.\u201cIRS employees are certainly very hard working and honest, they do the business of funding the government. They\u2019re saying they don\u2019t deserve to be treated as the enemy of the government,\u201d he said.He added that members who are of retirement age have expressed a greater desire to retire due to the increased attention on their jobs. More than half of the IRS\u2019 enforcement workforce of 80,000 is retirement eligible.Reardon said several workers have talked about being reminded of the 2010 Austin, Texas suicide attack, where Andrew Joseph Stack III deliberately crashed his single engine plane into the Echelon office building, killing himself and Internal Revenue Service manager Vernon Hunter.\u201cThe rhetoric we\u2019re hearing now is dangerous\u201d Reardon said. \u201cIt\u2019s putting these patriotic Americans at risk.\u201d\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Millions of Americans were waiting to learn the fate of their federal student debt on Wednesday as President Joe Biden was set to deliver on his campaign promise to provide $10,000 in debt cancellation for many Americans \u2014 and up to $10,000 more for those with the greatest financial need.Details of the plan have been kept closely guarded, but borrowers who earn less than $125,000 a year, or families earning less than $250,000, would be eligible for the $10,000 loan forgiveness, according to three people familiar with the decision. For recipients of Pell Grants, which are reserved for undergraduates with the most significant financial need, the federal government would cancel up to an additional $10,000 in federal loan debt, according to a copy of administration talking points obtained by the Associated Press.Biden is also set to extend a pause on federal student loan payments for what the White House calls the \u201cfinal time\u201d through the end of 2022.If his plan survives legal challenges that are almost certain to come, it could offer a windfall to a swath of the nation in the run-up to this fall\u2019s midterm elections. More than 43 million people have federal student debt, with an average balance of $37,667, according to federal data. Nearly a third of borrowers owe less than $10,000, and about half owe less than $20,000. The White House estimates that Biden\u2019s announcement would erase the federal student debt of about 20 million people.Proponents say cancellation will narrow the racial wealth gap \u2014 Black students are more likely to borrow federal student loans and at higher amounts than others. Four years after earning bachelor\u2019s degrees, Black borrowers owe an average of nearly $25,000 more than their white peers, according to a Brookings Institution study.Still, the action is unlikely to thrill any of the factions that have been jostling for influence as Biden weighs how much to cancel and for whom.Biden has faced pressure from liberals to provide broader relief to hard-hit borrowers, and from moderates and Republicans questioning the fairness of any widespread forgiveness. The delay in Biden\u2019s decision has only heightened the anticipation for what his own aides acknowledge represents a political no-win situation. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Biden\u2019s intended announcement ahead of time.The continuation of the coronavirus pandemic-era payment freeze comes just days before millions of Americans were set to find out when their next student loan bills will be due. This is the closest the administration has come to hitting the end of the payment freeze extension, with the current pause set to end Aug. 31.According to the administration\u2019s talking points, the Education Department will release information in the coming weeks for eligible borrowers to sign up for debt relief. Cancellation for some would be automatic, if the department has access to to their income information, but others would need to fill out a form.Current students would only be eligible for relief if their loans were originated before July 1, 2022. Biden is also set to propose capping the amount that borrowers pay monthly on undergraduate loans at 5% of their earnings.Wednesday\u2019s announcement was set for the White House after Biden returns from vacation in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.During the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden was initially skeptical of student loan debt cancellation as he faced off against more progressive candidates for the Democratic nomination. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had proposed cancellations of $50,000 or more.As he tried to shore up support among younger voters and prepare for a general election battle against President Donald Trump, Biden unveiled his initial proposal for debt cancellation of $10,000 per borrower, with no mention of an income cap.Biden narrowed his campaign promise in recent months by embracing the income limit as soaring inflation took a political toll and as he aimed to head off political attacks that the cancellation would benefit those with higher take-home pay. But Democrats, from members of congressional leadership to those facing tough reelection bids this November, have pushed the administration to go as broad as possible on debt relief, seeing it in part as a galvanizing issue, particularly for Black and young voters this fall.Democrats are betting that Biden, who has seen his public approval tumble over the past year, can help motivate younger voters to the polls with the announcement.Although Biden\u2019s plan is narrower than what he initially proposed during the campaign, \u201che\u2019ll get a lot of credit for following through on something that he was committed to,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who worked with Biden during the 2020 election.A survey of 18- to 29-year-olds conducted by the Harvard Institute of Politics in March found that 59% of those polled favored debt cancellation of some sort \u2014 whether for all borrowers or those most in need \u2014 although student loans did not rank high among issues that most concerned people in that age group.Some advocates say Biden\u2019s plan still falls short.\u201cIf the rumors are true, we\u2019ve got a problem,\u201d Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP, which has aggressively lobbied Biden to take bolder action, said Tuesday.\u201cPresident Biden\u2019s decision on student debt cannot become the latest example of a policy that has left Black people \u2014 especially Black women \u2014 behind,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not how you treat Black voters who turned out in record numbers and provided 90% of their vote to once again save democracy in 2020.\u201dJohn Della Volpe, who worked as a consultant on Biden\u2019s campaign and is the director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics, said the particulars of Biden\u2019s announcement were less important than the decision itself.\u201cIt\u2019s about trust in politics, in government, in our system. It\u2019s also about trust in the individual, which in this case is President Biden,\u201d Della Volpe said.Republicans, meanwhile, see a political upside if Biden pursues a large-scale cancellation of student debt ahead of the November midterms, anticipating backlash for Democrats \u2014 particularly in states where there are large numbers of working-class voters without college degrees. Critics of broad student debt forgiveness also believe it will open the White House to lawsuits, on the grounds that Congress has never given the president the explicit authority to cancel debt on his own.The Republican National Committee on Tuesday blasted Biden\u2019s expected announcement as a \u201chandout to the rich,\u201d claiming it would unfairly burden lower-income taxpayers and those who have already paid off their student loans with covering the costs of higher education for the wealthy.Biden\u2019s long deliberations have led to grumbling among federal loan servicers, who had been instructed to hold back billing statements while Biden weighed a decision.Industry groups had complained that the delayed decision left them with just days to notify borrowers, retrain customer service workers and update websites and digital payment systems, said Scott Buchanan, executive director of the Student Loan Servicing Alliance.It increases the risk that some borrowers will inadvertently be told they need to make payments, he said.\u201cAt this late stage I think that\u2019s the risk we\u2019re running,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just turn on a dime with 35 million borrowers who all have different loan types and statuses.\u201d___AP Education Writer Collin Binkley in Washington contributed to this report.___Follow AP\u2019s coverage of student loan debt at https://apnews.com/hub/student-loans.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostJerry Allison, a pioneering rock drummer who worked with rock legend Buddy Holly and his band The Crickets, died Monday at age 82.Allison\u2019s death was announced via a post on the official Buddy Holly Facebook page, which stated:\u201cJI was a musician ahead of his time, and undoubtedly his energy, ideas and exceptional skill contributed to both The Crickets, and rock n\u2019 roll itself, becoming such a success.\u201cBuddy is often heralded as the original singer-songwriter, but JI, too, wrote and inspired so many of the songs that would go on to be eternal classics.\u201dAllison was Holly\u2019s good friend and collaborator and co-wrote some of their most enduring songs, including \u201cThat\u2019ll Be The Day,\u201d \u201cNot Fade Away,\u201d and \u201cPeggy Sue,\u201d which was named after Allison\u2019s first wife.Born in 1939, Allison started playing the drums after his family moved to Lubbock, Texas, when he was 10, according to Variety.Allison told Lubbock Online in 2012 that he was inspired to \u201cwhack the drums\u201d after seeing a halftime show at a football game. Although he joined the school band, his musical career went in a different direction after he met Holly in junior high.\u201cWe met in the school yard at J.T. Hutchinson Junior High School. But we did not become best friends until some time in high school,\u201d Allison remembered. \u201cBuddy and [bassist] Bob Montgomery played for a school assembly program during my eighth-grade year, and it affected me like marching band in the fifth grade. It was the very best live music I had heard up to then.\u201dAlthough Allison did briefly play in the Texas Tech school band, he dropped out as his music career took off.\u201cBuddy got us a job backing Hank Thompson and George Jones and others for two weeks. We traveled 6,000 miles in two weeks,\u201d he told Texas Music Monthly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stay in college.\u201dHolly and Allison decided to name their band the Crickets after being inspired by a band called the Spiders.\u201cWe looked in the dictionary under insects and stopped at cricket. We had a lot of crickets in Texas that year, too,\u201d Allison said.Allison and Holly wrote the breakthrough hit \u201cThat\u2019ll Be The Day\u201d after seeing \u201cThe Searchers,\u201d a John Wayne Western that features the actor saying the line throughout the film.\u201cBuddy said, \u2018Let\u2019s write a song,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019ll be the day!\u2019 We worked on it for about half an hour,\u201d Allison recalled.Although legendary country music producer Owen Bradley dismissed the song as \u201cone of the worst\u201d he had ever heard, Brunswick Records\u2019 Bob Thiele signed Holly and the Crickets after he heard his kids playing the demo recording over and over again.Allison also helped Holly write \u201cPeggy Sue,\u201d which was originally called \u201cCindy Lou\u201d after Holly\u2019s niece. Allison convinced Holly to change the title to the name of his then-girlfriend and future wife, Peggy Sue Gerron.Allison approached percussion in innovative ways, such as by using a paradiddle beat on \u201cPeggy Sue,\u201d slapping his hands on his thighs for \u201cEveryday,\u201d and playing only tom-toms on the Everly Brothers\u2019 1960 hit \u201c(Till) I Kissed You,\u201d which was recorded after Holly\u2019s death.He also had a minor hit in 1958 with \u201cReal Wild Child,\u201d which he recorded under the name Ivan. After Holly died in a plane crash in 1959, Allison continued recording with the Crickets and writing songs, including \u201cMore Than I Can Say,\u201d which, in 1980, became a No. 2 hit for Leo Sayer.In addition, Allison and other members of the Crickets worked as Waylon Jennings\u2019 backup band in the 1970s, and Allison recorded with artists including Bobby Vee, Nanci Griffith and Paul McCartney.Although Holly was inducted into the first class of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, the Crickets weren\u2019t inducted until 2012. \u201cThat\u2019ll Be The Day\u201d was placed in the National Recording Registry in 2005.Allison last performed with the Crickets in 2016 before retiring to a farm outside Nashville.Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d star is doing his best to change the narrative about method acting, a practice that in recent years has included Jared Leto delaying \u201cMorbius\u201d filming by using fake crutches during pee breaks and \u201csnorting lines of arrabbiata sauce\u201d to prepare for \u201cHouse of Gucci.\u201d Garfield recently spoke out in defense of method acting, pushing back against \u201cmisconceptions\u201d about the infamous practice, which he said has worked for him.\u201cIt\u2019s not about being an asshole to everyone on set,\u201d Garfield said during an episode of Marc Maron\u2019s \u201cWTF\u201d podcast released on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s actually just about living truthfully under imagined circumstances, and being really nice to the crew simultaneously, and being a normal human being, and being able to drop it when you need to and staying in it when you want to stay in it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m kind of bothered by this idea that \u2018method acting is fucking bullshit,\u2019\u201d he continued, noting that critics have likely worked with \u201csomeone who claims to be a method actor but who actually isn\u2019t acting in the method at all.\u201dThe Oscar nominee said he prefers not to share the \u201cvery private\u201d process of creating a character internally.\u201cI don\u2019t want people to see how I\u2019m making the sausage,\u201d Garfield said. \u201cBut it really, really is profound work.\u201dThe actor did, however, touch upon the extreme lengths he took to prepare for his role as a Jesuit priest in Martin Scorsese\u2019s 2016 historical epic \u201cSilence,\u201d which he found to be a \u201can incredibly spiritual experience.\u201d\u201cI did a bunch of spiritual practices every day, I created new rituals for myself. I was celibate for six months, and fasting a lot, because me and [co-star Adam Driver] had to lose a bunch of weight anyway,\u201d Garfield recalled, noting the entire process lasted a year. \u201cIt was very cool, man. I had some pretty wild, trippy experiences from starving myself of sex and food at that time.\u201dWhile the process has paid off for Garfield, method acting has drawn some notable critics in recent years among a slew of actors, including David Harbour, Mads Mikkelsen, Sebastian Stan and Jon Bernthal.Harbour went as far to say that the process is \u201cdangerous,\u201d and \u201cdoesn\u2019t produce good work,\u201d while Stan described the approach as an \u201cirresponsible, narcissistic, kind of self-indulgent thing.\u201dMikkelsen, meanwhile, simply blasted method acting as \u201cbullshit.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Bowers\u2019 opponent David Farnsworth, who was endorsed by Trump, not only baselessly insisted the election Trump lost was rigged but that it was snatched by the \u201cdevil himself.\u201dBowers, a lifelong Republican who served in the Arizona House for 17 years, was one of the most compelling witnesses earlier this summer at a hearing before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.He recounted a high-pressure campaign by both Trump and Giuliani, who pushed him in a tense phone call to arbitrarily throw out the state\u2019s electoral votes for Joe Biden.Giuliani insisted to Bowers that \u201c200,000 illegal immigrants\u201d and more than 5,000 \u201cdead people\u201d voted in the state, Bowers testified. Bowers said he told Giuliani \u201cmultiple times\u201d that he needed proof and Giuliani had promised to provide it. But Bowers testified that he never received proof, not a single name of a fraudulent vote, he testified.\u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of theories but we don\u2019t have the evidence,\u201d Giuliani later admitted, Bowers testified.\u201cThere was no \u2015 no evidence being presented of any strength ... that would say to me, \u2018You have a doubt.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior National Correspondent, HuffPostDemocrats in Congress were thrilled when President Joe Biden signed a landmark climate and health care bill into law last week. But the moment felt bittersweet for some \u2015 among them, Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.). Dingell has been leading calls for a massive new investment in home and community-based services, or HCBS, which is the set of programs and supports that help the elderly and people with disabilities to live independently. The campaign has been personal for Dingell, who speaks frequently of the struggles she faced trying to find and coordinate care for her ailing husband, former Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), in his final years.Eighteen months ago, it looked like that campaign was on the cusp of success when a major HCBS proposal was part of Biden\u2019s \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d blueprint for coming legislation. And it wasn\u2019t just HCBS getting a White House push. Similarly sweeping proposals for child care and paid leave were also in the plan. Together, they formed a caregiving agenda, with a goal to create for the U.S. something that already exists in most economically advanced countries: a cradle-to-grave guarantee that people will have assistance and care at the most vulnerable periods of their lives. But with wafer-thin majorities and no realistic prospect of Republican support, Democratic leaders were at the mercy of more conservative members who wanted a smaller, less ambitious bill. The caregiving items were competing for resources alongside other initiatives and the pool of resources kept shrinking with each round of negotiations \u2015 until finally Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) made clear he would withhold his make-or-break 50th \u201cyea\u201d vote until Democrats dropped everything but the climate and health provisions.Dingell did her part to make sure the bill passed, celebrating the accomplishment with her colleagues. But she couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the missing caregiving pieces, including the HCBS initiative, especially in the last few weeks when the issue once again became personal: She was simultaneously trying to arrange ongoing care for her 88-year-old mother, who was about to leave the hospital following a cardiac emergency, and once again struggling to identify and hire caregivers. \u201cThis system is so broken,\u201d an exasperated Dingell told HuffPost in a phone interview, ticking off problems she\u2019d had finding caregivers. \u201cJust think about what this is like for somebody who doesn\u2019t already know how to be an advocate, how to get things organized, think about how much it costs and all the people who can\u2019t afford it.\u201dDingell said the experience has only reinforced her determination to get something done. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get it done, but I just look at that as an opportunity to begin again,\u201d she said. And she has plenty of company. In a series of interviews over the past two weeks, lawmakers, aides and advocates who worked on the caregiving agenda said they were in the same mindset, convinced that with more effort they could succeed.And they really might. Especially in recent history, success at major progressive reforms has followed high-profile, significant failures, whether it was the Affordable Care Act rising from the rubble of the Clinton health care plan or the new clean energy investments that Biden just signed emerging in the wake of the failed attempt to enact a \u201ccap and trade\u201d emissions program a decade ago.But that success didn\u2019t happen by accident. It happened, at least in part, because Democrats went through some serious introspection \u2015 taking stock of what went wrong and why, and how to avoid those problems in the future. The caregiving agenda supporters HuffPost interviewed all seemed to recognize this. They said those conversations are already taking place and that they already have some pretty good ideas about where the last effort came up short. But identifying problems is one thing. Solving them is quite another \u2014 especially when the political obstacles to progressive change of any kind remain so formidable.That\u2019s one reason the missed opportunity hurts so much: The political conditions of these past two years felt more favorable to enacting a caregiving agenda than ever before. The pandemic made clear how much families rely on paid care providers. It also illuminated underlying problems like the chronically low pay of care workers and the inability of providers to raise fees, which would allow them to boost pay, because the current prices max out so many families. One result has been widespread, well-publicized shortages of child care.\u201cAt least 16,000 programs have closed down permanently, while those that remain open are under immense strain from short-staffing pressures,\u201d Elliot Haspel, senior program officer for early childhood education at the Robins Foundation, told HuffPost. \u201cParents are hitting a wall of waitlists while those who can finagle a spot are paying even more exorbitant fees than before. It\u2019s not a complicated story: a fragile sector shattered.\u201dThe same basic dynamic of underpaid employees and employers who can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) pay them more is creating the shortage of home care workers that Dingell has seen firsthand and that has been generating headlines all across the country \u2014 in some cases, forcing seniors and people with disabilities to leave home and go back to institutional care settings.The pandemic has also thrown a spotlight onto the need for guaranteed paid leave, mainly by demonstrating what happens when workers don\u2019t have it. They go to work sick, infecting others, or lose their wages and sometimes their jobs.Advocates had something else going for them in the recent reform push. They were ready for the moment.They\u2019d been preparing for years, putting together plans and legislation. They also committed to working together, which was no small thing given past rivalries and tension over competition for limited resources. \u201cWe had an agreement that we would lift all of these issues together, that we would not be pitted against each other,\u201d Ai-jen Poo, president of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, told HuffPost. The unified front made them stronger and helped get buy-in from Democratic politicians, including the 2020 presidential candidates, all of whom included major caregiving proposals in their platforms. They also won support from the business community, mainly by demonstrating how care for children and elders, along with paid leave, helped to stabilize the workforce. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get it done, but I just look at that as an opportunity to begin again.\u201dBut even as the corporate community was cheering on the caregiving initiatives, it was fighting the tax increases to finance the new programs. \u201cI think that had a huge influence,\u201d said Vicki Shabo, a longtime paid leave advocate who is now a senior fellow at New America, a Washington-based think tank.And while the caregiving movement is a lot more organized than it was even a few years ago, it doesn\u2019t have the kind of advocacy or lobbying strength to overcome that kind of resistance \u2014 or even to ensure its priorities are something Democrats must address. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the sector still needs to build its power,\u201d said Haspel, who is also author of \u201cCrawling Behind: America\u2019s Childcare Crisis and How to Fix It.\u201d \u201cParents of young children are not feared as a constituency, and we simply don\u2019t have the money or political clout to throw around in the way that health care or climate or hedge fund managers do \u2014 the lobbying numbers are pretty meager.\u201dThe common rationale for federal action on child care, HCBS and paid leave is that society should take some collective responsibility for caregiving, through public programs, rather than letting it all fall on individual families. But that can be a difficult message to get across, when so many Americans are unaccustomed to their government playing that role.\u201cThere is still a misimpression [in the U.S.] that these programs and supports are not core to what the government should do,\u201d Shabo said.One way to change that impression is to publicize the instances where it is happening in the U.S. \u2014 which, for paid leave, means talking about states like California, Colorado and Maryland that have programs in place or are in the process of implementing them and documenting the results.Another is to try flipping the script on government action, which critics frequently portray as infringements on individual liberty.\u201cThese programs create freedom,\u201d Poo said. \u201cThey\u2019re enabling people\u2019s participation in the economy, freedom to help people with disabilities live independently and full, actual lives, whole lives. They free us from the guilt and the shame that comes with feeling like a failure when you can\u2019t afford or manage the care.\u201dAdvocates may also need to do a better job of simply conveying how far-reaching the impacts of caregiving are \u2014 partly to justify ambitious national action and partly to make sure people struggling in the current system realize it\u2019s not their fault.\u201cThere is still a misimpression [in the U.S.] that these programs and supports are not core to what the government should do.\u201d\u201cThis is not a niche issue,\u201d Poo said. \u201cFifty-three million family caregivers, and how many working parents who need child care? And then the number of boomers and older adults who are going to need these services in the next 10 to 15 years. ... The actual human cost and human impact of not moving on these issues and making progress, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s well enough understood.\u201d\u201cI feel like we were starting to chip away at this \u2026 but it is a deep, profound challenge,\u201d Poo said.For the caregiving agenda to become reality, its supporters may have to do more than rethink politics. They may need to rethink policy too, by subjecting their ideas to more outside scrutiny and contemplating major changes.One big question is the role of states. Both the child care and HCBS proposals put up a lot of federal money but depended on states taking the money and using it. The hope was that even conservative state officials would not turn down a chance to help so many constituents. This is more or less what\u2019s been happening during the pandemic, advocates noted: States have been accepting federal relief dollars to prop up child care without much political fuss. But the child care and HCBS proposals that were part of Build Back Better made the funds conditional on states making long-term changes to their programs, and committing to a small-but-ongoing contribution of state funding \u2014 which, as critics like Matt Bruenig of the People\u2019s Policy Project pointed out, sounds a lot more like the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion that to this day a dozen Republican-led states have rejected. \u201cI feel like we were starting to chip away at this\u2026 but it is a deep, profound challenge.\u201dFiguring out a way to avoid this problem, while still allowing for state flexibility where it makes sense as policy, is something advocates say they are already contemplating. \u201cWhatever we come up with for HCBS going forward, we want to make sure that every state, red or blue, gets the money,\u201d said Nicole Jorwic, chief of advocacy and campaigns at Caring Across Generations.A bigger question is whether to engage in some kind of more wholesale rethinking of the existing caregiving proposals, like whether programs should devote some money to subsidizing people who stay home and provide care directly for loved ones. This has been the one criticism conservatives and Republicans frequently make about Democratic child care plans \u2014 that they don\u2019t do enough for stay-at-home parents.Rethinking proposals is never easy; the difficult trade-offs of policy and politics inevitably lead to less-than-ideal solutions. But the lawmakers and activists who spoke to HuffPost all said they were willing to be flexible and compromise \u2014 and pointed to concessions they made this past year, as they tried to save elements of their agenda, as proof.\u201cI think sometimes there was sort of this idea that, you know, advocates were not willing to negotiate,\u201d Dawn Huckelbridge, director of Paid Leave for All, told HuffPost. \u201cAnd I think in each of our cases, that was absolutely not true.\u201d She noted that original proposals for paid leave envisioned 12 weeks and that, by the end, supporters in and outside Congress were willing to make do with as little as four \u2014 figuring that, once the plan was in place, they would have opportunities to expand it. \u201cWhat we often said was, for the majority of people in this country who have zero days of paid leave, this is transformative stuff,\u201d Huckelbridge said. \u201cSo of course we\u2019re not going to turn that down.\u201dThe lawmakers and advocates who have been working on the caregiving agenda also said they were open-minded about working with Republicans, whether it\u2019s on short-term fixes or longer-term plans. As evidence of potential Republican interest, several noted that two GOP senators (Richard Burr of North Carolina and Tim Scott of South Carolina) recently introduced a child care bill, while their Republican colleague from Florida, Marco Rubio, has long promoted his own version of paid leave.But a common theme in those GOP proposals is a lack of new funding. Under Rubio\u2019s proposal, for example, workers effectively pay for their own leave by giving up some of their future Social Security retirement benefits. \u201cAbsent real dollars, you\u2019re just squeezing a balloon, where either the workers or the families or both are sacrificing,\u201d said Melissa Boteach, vice president for income security and early learning/child care at the National Women\u2019s Law Center. Not that Democrats are always so helpful. Pledges never to raise taxes on the middle class can preclude social insurance schemes that rely on small payroll contributions, which is how Social Security and Medicare work \u2014 and how paid leave programs in the states work.\u201cI think the president\u2019s tax pledge created huge problems for us,\u201d Shabo said. All of that sounds like a lot of work ahead for the caregiving agenda\u2019s champions \u2014 and it probably is. But they\u2019ve also made a lot of progress already, coming within a few votes on Capitol Hill of enacting big pieces of their agenda. As recently as a few years ago, that would not have seemed possible. \u201cBecause of the countless families who shared their stories, Congress is finally paying attention to the caregiving crisis,\u201d said Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), another leader in the crusade for a new, more comprehensive HCBS program. \u201cFor the first time, Democrats all agree we need to invest in home care for seniors and people with disabilities and the workers who care for them.\u201dSen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), who has spearheaded the child care campaign for years, has also seen the difference. When she first got to the Senate in 1993, she said, nobody on Capitol Hill wanted to discuss child care \u2014 even though she knew, as a working parent and former preschool teacher, how many families were already struggling. \u201cIt was a silent epidemic,\u201d Murray told HuffPost.Now child care gets far more attention, Murray said. \u201cWe\u2019ve broadened the conversation, created a real movement, developed a knowledge base. That gives you such a head start in politics.\u201d At the same time, Murray added, whether that head start amounts to anything depends on picking up where this year\u2019s legislative effort left off. \u201cWe can\u2019t just vote on the last bill and call it a day,\u201d she said.Of course, the caregiving agenda\u2019s future will depend on one other, critical factor: whether a majority of lawmakers support and are willing to fight for it. The reality is that some version of the original caregiving proposals in Build Back Better might be law today if the House and Senate had even a handful of extra members who were committed to them.Rethinking policy, building coalitions, improving communications \u2014 all of that matters a lot. But ultimately success still depends on winning enough elections.Senior National Correspondent, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPostEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on Sunday said the U.S. will produce a record amount of gasoline next year as the Biden administration continues its efforts to reduce prices for Americans.But Granholm warned that consumers could still be affected by events overseas.\u201cAs you know, gasoline comes from oil,\u201d Granholm told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cOil is traded on a global market. So we are at the whim, if you will, of what happens globally.\u201dGranholm touted President Joe Biden\u2019s actions to boost the domestic supply of gasoline. That includes releasing one million barrels of oil per day from the nation\u2019s strategic reserves, which she called the \u201cbiggest tool at our disposal.\u201d\u201cThis is all about supply and demand,\u201d Granholm told Fox News\u2019 Trace Gallagher. \u201cWhen Russia invaded Ukraine, that pulled millions of barrels off of the global market. Since oil is traded globally, we have to make up for that lost amount of fuel.\u201dThe U.S. will produce a record amount of oil \u2014 12.7 million barrels per day \u2014 by next year, she said. The previous record was 12.2 barrels per day, according to The Hill.Gas prices started increasing in mid-2020 as the world adjusted to COVID, and went back up this year following Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine as Western countries sanctioned Russian oil, according to The Associated Press. Russia is one of the world\u2019s biggest oil producers.In early August, prices fell below $4 for the first time in five months, due to fears of a global recession, AP reported.The Energy Information Administration expects that by the fourth quarter of this year, gas prices will fall to $3.78 on average from the current $3.90 on average, Granholm said.\u201cThey\u2019ve fallen every single day of this summer,\u201d Granholm said of gas prices. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that that will continue.\u201dHowever, Granholm warned that China ramping up its economic activity could lead to prices rising again.China\u2019s \u201czero COVID\u201d policy has meant its economy \u2015 which is also facing separate challenges, including youth unemployment and a property crisis \u2015 has taken a hit, according to Bloomberg.\u201cIf China opens up significantly after COVID, there will be more pressure on demand,\u201d Granholm said. \u201cMore pressure on demand means upward pressure on prices. So we\u2019re watching what happens globally. But we are doing everything possible to try to stabilize supply and demand to keep those prices coming down.\u201dGranholm also spoke about how incentives included in the \u201cInflation Reduction Act\u201d \u2014 the Democrats\u2019 climate and health care law signed by Biden last week \u2014 could help the U.S. become energy independent by creating its own supply chain and energy ecosystem.\u201cThe president has said that we need to manufacture stuff in America, that we can\u2019t rely upon countries who don\u2019t share our values for the batteries for example for electric vehicles, which contain critical minerals, critical materials,\u201d she said.\u201cHe wants to re-shore manufacturing,\u201d Granholm added. \u201cIt\u2019s not just in electric vehicles, this Inflation Reduction Act provides credits to businesses to incentivize them to re-shore in America.\u201dPressed on whether clean energy sources, including solar and wind, are reliable, Granholm argued that the Democratic bill would help the U.S. fully take advantage of technology to enable that transition.\u201cThey are intermittent because the sun doesn\u2019t always shine and the wind doesn\u2019t always blow,\u201d Granholm said. \u201cBut the battery technology that stores that \u2014 that is also incentivized in this Inflation Reduction Act.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Leon Vitali, the \u201cBarry Lyndon\u201d actor who became one of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s closest associates, has died. He was 74.Vitali died Friday in Los Angeles, his family told The Associated Press Sunday. He passed peacefully surrounded by loved ones including his three children, Masha, Max and Vera.\u201cLeon was a special and lovely man driven by his curiosity, who spread love and warmth wherever he went,\u201d his children said in a statement provided by Masha Vitali. \u201cHe will be remembered with love and be hugely missed by the many people he touched.\u201dThough Vitali was often described as Kubrick\u2019s assistant, Tony Zierra\u2019s 2017 documentary \u201c Filmworker \u201d shed light on Vitali\u2019s enormous and largely unsung contributions to the work of one of cinema\u2019s greatest figures from \u201cThe Shining\u201d through \u201cEyes Wide Shut.\u201d He did everything from casting and coaching actors to overseeing restorations. Vitali even once set up a video monitor so that Kubrick could keep an eye on his dying cat.Matthew Modine, who starred in Kubrick\u2019s \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d tweeted his condolences Sunday.\u201cThere are people we meet who have a profound impact upon our lives. Leon Vitali was one such person in mine,\u201d Modine wrote. \u201cAn artist in every aspect of his life. A loving father & friend to so many. A kind, generous & forgiving nature. He exemplified & personified grace.\u201dFilmmaker Lee Unkrich also tweeted that he was, \u201cCompletely heartbroken to hear about the passing of Leon Vitali. He helped me (asterisk)enormously(asterisk) with my Shining book and I\u2019m gutted that he won\u2019t see it. He was a sweet, kind, humble, generous man and a vital part of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s team.\u201dBefore meeting Kubrick, Vitali was a rising actor in England, appearing in several British television shows including \u201cSoftly, Softly,\u201d \u201cFollyfoot,\u201d \u201cZ Cars\u201d and \u201cNotorious Woman.\u201d Then in 1974 he got his biggest break yet, when he was cast in \u201cBarry Lyndon\u201d as Lord Bullingdon, the son-in-law of Ryan O\u2019Neal\u2019s title character.Vitali was so fascinated by Kubrick and his processes that he made an unusual decision: He gave up on acting and devoted himself entirely to the famously demanding director for over two decades. His next Kubrick credit was as \u201cpersonal assistant to the director\u201d on \u201cThe Shining,\u201d though that\u2019s only part of the story \u2014 Vitali famously helped cast 4-year-old Danny Lloyd to play Danny Torrance and Louise and Lisa Burns as the creepy Grady twins (citing Diane Arbus as inspiration).\u201cI made one truly, truly radical change in my life and that was when I said, \u2018I\u2019m more interested in that\u2019 than I was in the acting,\u201d Vitali told the Associated Press in 2017. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest conscious decision I\u2019ve ever made. There were some sacrifices, but there were gains too.\u201dAfter Kubrick\u2019s death in 1999, Vitali oversaw restorations for many of Kubrick\u2019s films. He received a Cinema Audio Society award for his work. Vitali later worked with director Todd Field on his films \u201cLittle Children\u201d and \u201cIn the Bedroom.\u201dBefore making the documentary, Zierra said that he and many Kubrick-obsessed fans knew Vitali for his performances in \u201cBarry Lyndon\u201d and \u201cEyes Wide Shut,\u201d in which he played Red Cloak, and as a key member of Kubrick\u2019s inner circle. But when they finally met Vitali to make the film, they were struck by \u201chis kindness, humility and the fascinating scope of his story.\u201dZierra is working on a director\u2019s cut of \u201cFilmworker\u201d that will include new footage that he and Vitali wanted in the film, but couldn\u2019t get done in time for its Cannes debut in 2017.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A judge has declined to block a section of a Georgia election law that bans handing out food and water to voters waiting in line.The provision is part of a sweeping elections overhaul passed by Georgia lawmakers last year. Voting rights groups, who have filed a lawsuit challenging multiple parts of the law, argued that the provision infringes their free speech rights and should be immediately blocked while the case is pending.The 74-page order, which was issued Thursday, means that the provision will remain in effect for the closely watched November general election. Republican Gov. Brian Kemp is locked in a rematch with Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams, while Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock is trying to fend off a challenge from Republican Herschel Walker.The state had argued that the provision was necessary to protect against conditions at polling places that could raise worries over potential illegal campaigning or vote buying. State lawyers also argued it was too close to the upcoming election to make changes.U.S. District Judge J.P. Boulee said the voting rights groups may ultimately prevail on part of their challenge, but he agreed with the state that it\u2019s too close to the election to block any part of the provision. He noted that requiring different rules for the general election than those in place for the primaries earlier this year could cause confusion for election workers.Boulee said that voting rights groups had failed to show that prohibiting the distribution of food and drinks within 150 feet (45 meters) of a polling place violates their constitutional rights. But he said that another part of the provision that bars people from offering food and drink within 25 feet (7.6 meters) of any person in line is probably unconstitutional because that zone is tied to the location of voters and could stretch thousands of feet from the polling place.The voting rights groups expressed disappointment with Boulee\u2019s ruling but said they will continue to fight.\u201cWhile Georgia\u2019s cruel ban on line relief stands for now, we look forward to presenting our broader case against SB 202 at trial, where we will prove that many provisions in the legislation violate federal law and the Constitution,\u201d said ACLU of Georgia voting rights attorney Rahul Garabadu.Republicans have said high turnout and short lines in this year\u2019s primary elections show that the new law doesn\u2019t discourage or restrict voting. But critics say it disproportionately affects marginalized voters, and many Democrats have pledged to roll it back.The U.S. Justice Department has also filed a lawsuit alleging that the 98-page Georgia voting law is racially discriminatory, but it was not part of the request to immediately block the food and water provision.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) \u2014 Former Vice President Mike Pence said Friday that he didn\u2019t take any classified information with him when he left office.The disclosure \u2014 which would typically be unremarkable for a former vice president \u2014 is notable given that FBI agents seized classified and top secret information from his former boss\u2019s Florida estate on Aug. 8 while investigating potential violations of three different federal laws. Former President Donald Trump has claimed that the documents seized by agents were \u201call declassified.\u201dPence, asked directly if he had retained any classified information upon leaving office, told The Associated Press in an interview, \u201cNo, not to my knowledge.\u201dDespite the inclusion of material marked \u201ctop secret\u201d in the government\u2019s list of items recovered from Mar-a-Lago, Pence said, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t want to prejudge it before until we know all the facts.\u201dPence was in Iowa on Friday as part of a two day-trip to the state, which hosts the leadoff Republican presidential caucuses. It comes as the former vice president has made stops in other early voting states as he takes steps toward mounting a 2024 White House campaign.Pence also weighed in on Republican U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney\u2019s primary defeat earlier in the week to a rival backed by Trump. Cheney, who is arguably Trump\u2019s most prominent Republican critic, has called the former president \u201ca very grave threat and risk to our republic\u201d and further raised his ire through her role as vice chair of the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\u201cMy reaction was, the people of Wyoming have spoken,\u201d said Pence, who was targeted at the Capitol that day by angry rioters, including some who chanted, \u201cHang Mike Pence!\u201d \u201cAnd, you know, I accept their judgment about the kind of representation they want on Capitol Hill.\u201dPence said he has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for Cheney\u2019s father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served two terms under President George W. Bush.\u201cAnd I appreciate the conservative stance Congresswoman Cheney has taken over the years,\u201d Pence continued. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been disappointed in the partisan taint of the Jan. 6 committee from early on.\u201dPence\u2019s aides said the committee contacted his legal team months ago to see if he would be willing to testify. Although Pence has said he would give \u201cdue consideration\u201d to cooperating, he was adamant that the historic nature of such participation must be warranted and agreed upon.\u201cBeyond my concerns about the partisan nature of the Jan. 6 committee, there are profound constitutional issues that have to be considered,\u201d he said. \u201cNo vice president has ever been summoned to testify before the Congress of the United States.\u201dSpeaking further about the search of Mar-a-Lago, the former vice president raised the possibility, as he has previously, that the investigation was politically motivated and called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to disclose more details on what led authorities to conduct the search.\u201cThe concern that millions of Americans felt is only going to be resolved with daylight,\u201d Pence said Friday. \u201cI know that\u2019s not customary in an investigation. But this is unprecedented action by the Justice Department, and I think it merits an unprecedented transparency.\u201dThe Jan. 6 insurrection marked the first in a number of public breaks between Trump and his once devout No. 2. But Pence has been careful not to alienate Republicans who have supported Trump but might be looking for another candidate in the 2024 election. Despite his reluctance to criticize the former president, Pence has occasionally spoken out against Trump, criticizing the attack at the U.S. Capitol and more recently urging his fellow Republicans to stop lashing out at the FBI over the search of Mar-a-Lago.\u201cThe Republican Party is the party of law and order,\u201d Pence said Wednesday at a political breakfast in New Hampshire. \u201cOur party stands with the men and women who stand on the thin blue line at the federal and state and local level, and these attacks on the FBI must stop.\u201dPence said Friday that he would make a decision early next year about whether to run for the White House, a move that his aides have said will be independent of what Trump decides to do.Having visited the Iowa State Fair on Friday afternoon, Pence also headlined a fundraiser earlier in the day for Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and was scheduled to speak to a Christian conservative group and a northern Iowa county Republican Party fundraiser before leaving Saturday.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A Georgia judge on Thursday denied bond \u2014 again \u2014 for Atlanta rapper Young Thug, one of nearly 30 people charged in a 65-count indictment alleging he is the leader of a criminal street gang.Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville heard a slew of outstanding motions in the case against the musician, whose real name is Jeffery Williams. Rapper Gunna, whose legal name is Sergio Kitchens, is also charged in the racketeering and gang case. Both men have been in jail since their May arrests.The musicians are accused of conspiring to violate Georgia\u2019s criminal racketeering law, but the indictment outlines more serious crimes allegedly carried out by \u201cYoung Slime Life\u201d associates ranging from drug possession to murder.Of the 28 people charged, three remain at large, while at least eight who are in custody still don\u2019t have attorneys, prosecutors told the judge, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.So far, Glanville has not granted bond to any of the defendants, citing concerns about witness intimidation and the possibility that additional felonies may be committed ahead of January\u2019s trial. Williams\u2019 attorneys have repeatedly asked that their client be given an ankle monitor and allowed to await trial on house arrest.Appearing via video conferencing from the Cobb County jail, Williams smiled and blew kisses at relatives gathered in the courtroom during breaks in Thursday\u2019s proceedings.\u201cMr. Williams is an artist, a role model, a father and a son,\u201d attorney Brian Steel told the judge, urging the rapper be released.But his request was denied for the third time when Glanville sided with prosecutors to keep the musician behind bars.The decision came after Glanville heard of at least one associate planning to testify against Williams being placed in protective custody after a document posted online showed his willingness to cooperate.Fulton County prosecutor Don Geary asked the judge to further restrict the disclosure of certain evidence ahead of trial, saying a page from discovery that was recently shared online jeopardizes the witness\u2019 safety.\u201cWe found a lot of information concerning one of our witnesses on basically a (celebrity news) outlet,\u201d Geary told Glanville.Defense attorneys contend that YSL, or Young Stoner Life, is simply the name of Young Thug\u2019s record label, not a violent Atlanta street gang as prosecutors allege.Thursday\u2019s hearing wasn\u2019t the first time prosecutors have raised concerns about the safety of state\u2019s witnesses. Glanville previously issued a temporary order instructing defense attorneys to withhold witness contact information from their clients.But Kristen Novay, one of Kitchens\u2019 attorneys, asked prosecutors for proof that potential witnesses are actually being threatened.\u201cWe want to know what specific threats there are,\u201d Novay said. \u201cThere have been many allegations that there are threats to witnesses, and to date we have received no discovery, not a single shred of evidence from a witness who was actually threatened.\u201dIn June, an 18-year-old relative of one of the defendants was arrested after allegedly threatening to kill the Fulton County sheriff and his wife unless Williams were released, authorities said, the newspaper reported.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Attorneys for many of the nation\u2019s largest media companies will try to persuade a federal magistrate judge on Thursday afternoon to make public the affidavit supporting the warrant that allowed FBI agents to search former President Donald Trump\u2019s Florida estate last week.The Associated Press, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, the broadcast TV networks, CNN and others want U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce E. Reinhart to release the affidavit over the objection of the U.S. Justice Department, which says its investigation of Trump\u2019s handling of \u201chighly classified material\u201d would be compromised.The media companies argue the affidavit\u2019s release would help the public determine if the Justice Department had legitimate reasons for the search or if it was part of a Biden administration vendetta against Trump, as the former president and his backers contend. Trump, in a Truth Social post last week, called for the release of the unredacted affidavit in the interest of transparency.\u201cThe matter is one of utmost public interest, involving the actions of current and former government officials,\u201d wrote attorney Carol Jean LoCiero, who is representing the Times and others. \u201cPresident Trump decried the the search as an \u2018assault that could only take place in Third World Countries,\u2019 asserted agents \u2018even broke into my safe,\u2019 and otherwise challenged the validity of the search.\u201dJustice Department attorneys argued in a court filing that its investigation into Trump\u2019s handling of \u201chighly classified material\u201d is ongoing and that the document contains sensitive information about witnesses.The filing by Juan Antonio Gonzalez, the U.S. attorney in Miami, and Jay Bratt, a top Justice Department national security official, says making the affidavit public would \u201ccause significant and irreparable damage to this ongoing criminal investigation.\u201d\u201cIf disclosed, the affidavit would serve as a roadmap to the government\u2019s ongoing investigation, providing specific details about its direction and likely course, in a manner that is highly likely to compromise future investigative steps,\u201d they wrote.As of Wednesday afternoon, Trump\u2019s attorneys had not indicated on the court\u2019s docket that they plan to take part in the hearing.FBI agents searched Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate on Aug. 8, removing 11 sets of classified documents, with some not only marked top secret but also \u201csensitive compartmented information,\u201d according to a receipt of what was taken that was released Friday. That is a special category meant to protect the nation\u2019s most important secrets that if revealed publicly could cause \u201cexceptionally grave\u201d damage to U.S. interests.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The head of nation\u2019s top public health agency on Wednesday announced a shake-up of the organization, intended to make it more nimble.The planned changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 CDC leaders call it a \u201creset\u201d\u2014 come amid ongoing criticism of the agency\u2019s response to COVID-19, monkeypox and other public health threats. The changes include internal staffing moves and steps to speed up data releases.The CDC\u2019s director, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, told the agency\u2019s staff about the changes on Wednesday. It\u2019s a CDC initiative, and was not directed by the White House or other administration officials, she said.\u201cI feel like it\u2019s my my responsibility to lead this agency to a better place after a really challenging three years,\u201d Walensky told The Associated Press.The CDC, with a $12 billion budget and more than 11,000 employees, is an Atlanta-based federal agency charged with protecting Americans from disease outbreaks and other public health threats. It\u2019s customary for each CDC director to do some reorganizing, but Walensky\u2019s action comes amid a wider demand for change.The agency has long been criticized as too ponderous, focusing on collection and analysis of data but not acting quickly against new health threats. But public unhappiness with the agency grew dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts said the CDC was slow to recognize how much virus was entering the U.S. from Europe, to recommend people wear masks, to say the virus can spread through the air, and to ramp up systematic testing for new variants.\u201cWe saw during COVID that CDC\u2019s structures, frankly, weren\u2019t designed to take in information, digest it and disseminate it to the public at the speed necessary,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a health policy researcher at the Yale School of Public Health.Walensky, who became director in January 2021, has long said the agency has to move faster and communicate better, but stumbles have continued during her tenure.In April, she called for an in-depth review of the agency, which resulted in the announced changes. Her reorganization proposal must be approved by the Department of Health and Human Services secretary. CDC officials say they hope to have a full package of changes finalized, approved, and underway by early next year.Some changes still are being formulated, but steps announced Wednesday include:\u2014Increasing use of preprint scientific reports to get out actionable data, instead of waiting for research to go through peer review and publication by the CDC journal Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.\u2014Restructuring the agency\u2019s communications office and further revamping CDC websites to make the agency\u2019s guidance for the public more clear and easier to find.\u2014Altering the length of time agency leaders are devoted to outbreak responses to a minimum of six months \u2014 an effort to address a turnover problem that at times caused knowledge gaps and affected the agency\u2019s communications.\u2014Creation of a new executive council to help Walensky set strategy and priorities.\u2014Appointing Mary Wakefield as senior counselor to implement the changes. Wakefield headed the Health Resources and Services Administration during the Obama administration and also served as the No. 2 administrator at HHS.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s leading reproductive health care provider and abortion rights advocacy organization, plans to spend a record $50 million ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections, pouring money into contests where access to abortion will be on the ballot.The effort, which breaks the group\u2019s previous $45 million spending record set in 2020, comes months after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that created a constitutional right to have an abortion. It will be waged by the organization\u2019s political and advocacy arms and will focus on governor\u2019s offices, U.S. Senate seats and legislative races in nine states where abortion rights could be restricted or expanded depending on the outcome at the ballot.The historic proportions of the midterm campaign, when less money is usually spent, were made possible by a torrent of money raised after the decision by the high court\u2019s new conservative majority, touching off a tectonic shift in the politics of abortion. Now, for the first time, Republicans who have long campaigned against abortion and Roe v. Wade will face voters on an issue that is no longer hypothetical and carries real life consequences.Planned Parenthood says its spending will help remind voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin what\u2019s at stake in a bid to drive turnout by Democratic and independent voters.\u201cWho wins in these midterm elections will determine whether a state has access to abortion and potentially determine whether we will face a national abortion ban,\u201d said Jenny Lawson, the executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes. \u201cWe will be clear about who is on which side.\u201dA recent poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found a majority of Americans think Congress should pass a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide. More than half of the respondents said they feel at least somewhat \u201csad\u201d or \u201cangry\u201d about the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.Earlier this month in red-state Kansas, voters rejected by nearly 20 percentage points a constitutional amendment that would have allowed the legislature to advance a ban on abortion.Whether it truly is a galvanizing issue will become clear after Election Day, Nov. 8.\u201cWe say this every cycle: \u2018This is the important election,\u2019\u201d said Amy Kennedy, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Votes in Georgia. \u201cFor us, this really is the most important election cycle of our life.\u201dPlanned Parenthood says it intends to contact 6 million voters through door knocking, phone calls, digital advertising, mailers and radio ads. It has already run some TV ads in Wisconsin, where Republicans control the statehouse and where Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson are up for reelection.It also is launching a website, takecontrol2022.com.While the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in June effectively left setting abortion policy to the states, Planned Parenthood says it is also investing in U.S. Senate races because Republicans have expressed an interest in pursuing a national abortion ban, though such a measure would almost certainly be vetoed by President Joe Biden.Democrats and their allies have long tried, without much success, to energize supporters by focusing on abortion. But the Supreme Court\u2019s decision clarified the stakes as never before. In roughly a dozen states led by Republicans, abortion has already been banned or heavily restricted. Many more are expected to follow.\u201cWhen people go to vote this November, nearly half of the folks voting could be living in a state that either has already banned abortion or is quickly moving to ban abortion. These are entirely new circumstances,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cThere are a lot of issues people care about, certainly, but the state of abortion access is absolutely one of the defining issues this November.\u201d\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A federal judge on Monday said U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham must testify before a special grand jury in Atlanta that is investigating whether then-President Donald Trump and his allies broke any laws while trying to overturn his narrow 2020 general election loss in the state.Attorneys for Graham (R-S.C.) had argued that his position as a U.S. senator provided him immunity from having to appear before the investigative panel and asked the judge to quash his subpoena. But U.S. District Judge Leigh Martin May wrote in an order Monday that immunities related to his role as a senator do not protect him from having to testify. Graham\u2019s subpoena instructs him to appear before the special grand jury on Aug. 23, but he is expected to appeal the judge\u2019s ruling.Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis opened the investigation last year, and a special grand jury with subpoena power was seated in May at her request. Last month she filed petitions seeking to compel testimony from seven Trump advisers and associates.Prosecutors have indicated they want to ask Graham about phone calls they say he made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks following Trump\u2019s election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.Graham had argued that a provision of the Constitution provides absolute protection against a senator being questioned about legislative acts. But the judge found there are \u201cconsiderable areas of potential grand jury inquiry\u201d that fall outside that provision\u2019s scope. The judge also rejected Graham\u2019s argument that the principle of \u201csovereign immunity\u201d protects a senator from being summoned by a state prosecutor.Graham also argued that Willis, a Democrat, had not demonstrated extraordinary circumstances necessary to compel testimony from a high-ranking official. But the judge disagreed, finding that Willis has shown \u201cextraordinary circumstances and a special need\u201d for Graham\u2019s testimony on issues related to alleged attempt to influence or disrupt the election in Georgia.May, the judge, last month rejected a similar attempt by U.S. Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., to avoid testifying before the special grand jury. Former New York mayor and Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani had argued he couldn\u2019t travel to Atlanta to testify because of health issues, but Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who\u2019s overseeing the special grand jury, instructed him to appear on Wednesday.A Graham spokesperson, Kevin Bishop, said Monday the senator had no comment but referred to what Graham said when asked about the probe last week. During a news conference in Columbia, S.C., Graham said, \u201cWe will take this as far as we need to take it\u201d when asked about his efforts to fight his subpoena.\u201cI was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and had to vote on certifying an election,\u201d Graham told reporters. \u201cThis is ridiculous. This weaponization of the law needs to stop. So I will use the courts. We will go as far as we need to go and do whatever needs to be done to make sure that people like me can do their jobs without fear of some county prosecutor coming after you.\u201dIn calls made shortly after the 2020 general election, Graham \u201cquestioned Secretary Raffensperger and his staff about reexamining certain absentee ballots cast in Georgia in order to explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome for former President Donald Trump,\u201d Willis wrote in a petition.Graham also \u201cmade reference to allegations of widespread voter fraud in the November 2020 election in Georgia, consistent with public statements made by known affiliates of the Trump Campaign,\u201d she wrote.Republican and Democratic state election officials across the country, courts and even Trump\u2019s attorney general found there was no evidence of any voter fraud sufficient to affect the outcome of his 2020 presidential election loss.___Associated Press writer Meg Kinnard in Columbia, S.C., contributed reporting.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

David Leitch\u2019s assassin-crowded film, made for $90 million, has grossed $54.4 million in two weeks for Sony Pictures. Globally, \u201cBullet Train\u201d has grossed $114.5 million.Three new films went into wide release but none cracked the top five films. The slowdown \u2014 an expected but still acute late-summer downturn in big releases \u2014 gave plenty of airspace for the year\u2019s biggest movie, \u201cMaverick,\u201d to make another fly-by in theaters.Nearly three months after opening in May, Paramount Pictures put the \u201cTop Gun\u201d sequel back on a number of large-format screens and increased its theater count from 2,760 to 3,181.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, the Arizona Democrat who single-handedly thwarted her party\u2019s longtime goal of raising taxes on wealthy investors, received nearly $1 million over the past year from private equity professionals, hedge fund managers and venture capitalists whose taxes would have increased under the plan.For years, Democrats have promised to raise taxes on such investors, who pay a significantly lower rate on their earnings than ordinary workers. But just as they closed in on that goal last week, Sinema forced a series of changes to her party\u2019s $740 billion election-year spending package, eliminating a proposed \u201ccarried interest\u201d tax increase on private equity earnings while securing a $35 billion exemption that will spare much of the industry from a separate tax increase other huge corporations now have to pay.The bill, with Sinema\u2019s alterations intact, was given final approval by Congress on Friday and is expected to be signed by President Joe Biden next week.Sinema has long aligned herself with the interests of private equity, hedge funds and venture capital, helping her net at least $1.5 million in campaign contributions since she was elected to the House a decade ago. But the $983,000 she has collected since last summer more than doubled what the industry donated to her during all of her preceding years in Congress combined, according to an Associated Press review of campaign finances disclosures.The donations, which make Sinema one of the industry\u2019s top beneficiaries in Congress, serve a reminder of the way that high-power lobbying campaigns can have dramatic implications for the way legislation is crafted, particularly in the evenly divided Senate where there are no Democratic votes to spare. They also highlight a degree of political risk for Sinema, whose unapologetic defense of the industry\u2019s favorable tax treatment is viewed by many in her party as indefensible.\u201cFrom their vantage point, it\u2019s a million dollars very well spent,\u201d said Dean Baker, a senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal-leaning think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty rare you see this direct of a return on your investment. So I guess I would congratulate them.\u201dSinema\u2019s office declined to make her available for an interview. Hannah Hurley, a Sinema spokesperson, acknowledged the senator shares some of the industry\u2019s views on taxation, but rebuffed any suggestion that the donations influenced her thinking.\u201cSenator Sinema makes every decision based on one criteria: what\u2019s best for Arizona,\u201d Hurley said in a statement. \u201cShe has been clear and consistent for over a year that she will only support tax reforms and revenue options that support Arizona\u2019s economic growth and competitiveness.\u201dThe American Investment Council, a trade group that lobbies on behalf of private equity, also defended their push to defeat the tax provisions.\u201cOur team worked to ensure that members of Congress from both sides of the aisle understand how private equity directly employs workers and supports small businesses throughout their communities,\u201d Drew Maloney, the organization\u2019s CEO and president, said in a statement.Sinema\u2019s defense of the tax provisions offer a jarring contrast to her background as a Green Party activist and self-styled \u201cPrada socialist\u201d who once likened accepting campaign cash to \u201cbribery\u201d and later called for \u201cbig corporations & the rich to pay their fair share\u201d shortly before launching her first campaign for Congress in 2012.She\u2019s been far more magnanimous since, praising private equity in 2016 from the House floor for providing \u201cbillions of dollars each year to Main Street businesses\u201d and later interning at a private equity mogul\u2019s boutique winery in northern California during the 2020 congressional recess.The soaring contributions from the industry to Sinema trace back to last summer. That\u2019s when she first made clear that she wouldn\u2019t support a carried interest tax increase, as well as other corporate and business tax hikes, included in an earlier iteration of Biden\u2019s agenda.During a two-week period in September alone, Sinema collected $47,100 in contributions from 16 high-ranking officials from the private equity firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, records show. Employees and executives of KKR, another private equity behemoth, contributed $44,100 to Sinema during a two-month span in late 2021.In some cases, the families of private equity managers joined in. David Belluck, a partner at the firm Riverside Partners, gave a $5,800 max-out contribution to Sinema one day in late June. So did three of his college-age kids, with the family collectively donating $23,200, records show.\u201cI generally support centrist Democrats and her seat is important to keep a Democratic Senate majority,\u201d Belluck said, adding that his family has known Sinema since her election to Congress. \u201cShe and I have never discussed private equity taxation.\u201dThe donations from the industry coincide with a $26 million lobbying effort spearheaded by the investment firm Blackstone that culminated on the Senate floor last weekend.By the time the bill was up for debate during a marathon series of votes, Sinema had already forced Democrats to abandon their carried interest tax increase.\u201cSenator Sinema said she would not vote for the bill .. unless we took it out,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters last week. \u201cWe had no choice.\u201dBut after private equity lobbyists discovered a provision in the bill that would have subjected many of them to a separate 15% corporate minimum tax, they urgently pressed Sinema and other centrist Democrats for changes, according to emails as well as four people with direct knowledge of the matter who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.\u201cGiven the breaking nature of this development we need as many offices as possible weighing in with concerns to Leader Schumer\u2019s office,\u201d Blackstone lobbyist Ryan McConaghy wrote in a Saturday afternoon email obtained by the AP, which included proposed language for modifying the bill. \u201cWould you and your boss be willing to raise the alarm on this and express concerns with Schumer and team?\u201dMcConaghy did not respond to a request for comment.Sinema worked with Republicans on an amendment that stripped the corporate tax increase provisions from the bill, which a handful of vulnerable Democrats also voted for.\u201cSince she has been in Congress, Kyrsten has consistently supported pro-growth policies that encourage job creation across Arizona. Her tax policy positions and focus on growing Arizona\u2019s economy and competitiveness are longstanding and well known,\u201d Hurley, the Sinema spokesperson, said.But many in her party disagree. They say the favorable treatment does little to boost the overall economy and argue there\u2019s little compelling evidence to suggest the tax benefits are enjoyed beyond some of the wealthiest investors.Some of Sinema\u2019s donors make their case.Blackstone, a significant source of campaign contributions, owns large tracts of real estate in Sinema\u2019s home state, Arizona. The firm was condemned by United Nations experts in 2019 who said Blackstone\u2019s financial model was responsible for a \u201cfinancialization of housing\u201d that has driven up rents and home costs, \u201cpushing low-income, and increasingly middle-income people from their homes.\u201dBlackstone employees executives and their family members have given Sinema $44,000 since 2018, records show.In a statement, Blackstone called the allegations by the U.N. experts \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d and said all employee contributions are \u201cstrictly personal.\u201d The firm added that it was \u201cincredibly proud of its investments in housing.\u201dAnother major financial services donor is Centerbridge Partners, a New York-based firm that buys up the debt of distressed governments and companies and often uses hardball tactics to extract value. Since 2017, Sinema has collected at least $29,000 from donors associated with the firm, including co-founder Mark Gallogly and his wife, Elizabeth Strickler, records show.In 2012, Centerbridge Partners purchased Arizona-based restaurant chain P.F. Chang\u2019s for roughly $1 billion. After loading the struggling company up with $675 million of debt, they sold it to another private equity group in 2019, according to Bloomberg News. The company received a $10 million coronavirus aid loan to cover payroll, but shed jobs and closed locations as it struggled with the pandemic.Centerbridge Partners was also part of a consortium of hedge funds that helped usher in an era of austerity in Puerto Rico after buying up billions of dollars of the island government\u2019s $72 billion debt \u2014 and filing legal proceedings to collect. A subsidiary of Centerbridge Partners was among a group of creditors who repeatedly sued one of the U.S. territory\u2019s pension funds. In one 2016 lawsuit, the group of creditors asked a judge to divert money from a Puerto Rican pension fund in order to collect.A Centerbridge representative could not immediately provide comment Friday.Liberal activists in Arizona say they plan to make Sinema\u2019s reliance on donations from wealthy investors a campaign issue when she is up for reelection in 2024.\u201cThere are many takes on how to win, but there is no universe in which it is politically smart to fight for favorable tax treatment of the wealthiest people in the country,\u201d said Emily Kirkland, a political consultant who works for progressive candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely going to be a potent issue.\u201d___Associated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "PHOENIX (AP) \u2014 U.S. transportation officials announced $2.2 billion for local infrastructure projects on Thursday, paving the way for new bridges, roads, bike lanes, railways and ports in scores of communities across the country.The competitive grants are more than double the amount awarded the previous year under the same program. The influx comes from a $1 trillion infrastructure law backed by President Joe Biden, which provided an additional $7.5 billion over five years for the grants.Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the projects would help modernize America\u2019s transportation systems.\u201cThis is a program that recognizes many of the most interesting and compelling ideas and designs and plans aren\u2019t going to come from Washington, but more of the funding should,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re delivering here.\u201dButtigieg traveled to Arizona to highlight projects in Phoenix and Tucson, each of which are receiving the maximum $25 million. In Phoenix, the money will help build a new bike and pedestrian bridge over the Rio Salado, connecting the city\u2019s southern area with downtown.In Tucson, the money will revamp a prominent street and replace a 1960s-era vehicle bridge that\u2019s in poor condition. It also will add a separate bicycle and pedestrian bridge as part of what Mayor Regina Romero called \u201ca transformative investment in Tucson\u2019s infrastructure.\u201dWhile the Tucson project will expand the number lanes for motorists, some projects elsewhere will reduce them. For example, a $17 million grant will help narrow a five-lane road to three lanes in the Chicago suburb of Munster, Indiana, in an effort to decrease traffic crashes. The money also will fund a 10-foot-wide multi-purpose path along the street and plant more than 250 trees.For many road improvement grants, \u201cwe\u2019re doing it in mind of also benefitting the bike and pedestrian side,\u201d Buttigieg said.Other newly announced projects in the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity program also provide funding for bicycle and pedestrian paths.Texas and Kansas are each receiving about $25 million for hiking and biking trails. Huntsville, Alabama, is getting $20 million to improve a pedestrian corridor linking downtown to isolated neighborhoods. Another $20 million is helping finance a new bike and pedestrian bridge over the Potomac River between Arlington, Virginia, and Washington, D.C.Buttigieg said the U.S. Department of Transportation received about $13 billion in grant applications.A total of 166 projects across the country are getting a slice of the $2.2 billion. The funding marks a significant increase from the $983 million distributed among 90 projects in 2021. The allotment is the largest dating to 2009 for a program that has undergone multiple name and emphasis changes during the presidential administrations of Barack Obama and Donald Trump.Though still substantial, the funding doesn\u2019t have quite the buying power as anticipated when the infrastructure legislation passed Congress last year. That\u2019s because inflation has driven up the cost of key transportation construction materials, such as steel plates for bridges and asphalt for paving roads.This year\u2019s projects range from a new seawall and port improvements in Sitka, Alaska, to the construction of a four-lane parkway in the Virgin Islands.Among other projects, New Jersey is getting $20 million to elevate a roadway that serves as a main evacuation route for Atlantic City and its casino industry. In Louisiana, $20 million will go toward the design and construction of two train stations along a planned route between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. Whatcom County, Washington, will get $25 million to replace a 60-year-old ferry serving rural Lummi Island with an electric hybrid model.\u2014-Lieb reported from Jefferson City, Mo.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Politics Reporter, HuffPostDemocrats pulled off a fairly brilliant bit of marketing recently, rebranding their big domestic legislation (\u201cBuild Back Better\u201d) into the smaller Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The new name is easier to understand, addresses voters\u2019 driving economic worries and satisfied the needs of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), whose support was crucial.The legislation is substantial. It\u2019s the biggest federal investment in fighting climate change ever and the biggest change in Medicare since 2003. But when it comes to actually reducing inflation, as its name promises, budget experts say it leaves much to be desired. With the House set to pass it Friday and send it on to President Joe Biden for his signature, the bill will be one of the Democrats\u2019 primary defenses on the campaign trail when they\u2019re asked about what they did about rising prices. But Republicans have attacked the bill as actually doing little.\u201cThe country is running on Joe Biden and congressional Democrats\u2019 record. It is a miserable record with a cruel economy, and nothing they\u2019re going to do can change that because this will not tamp down inflation,\u201d Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) said Monday on Fox News.Brady\u2019s concern found a sympathetic ear in the unlikely form of Senate Budget Committee chair Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who was frustrated that Democrats didn\u2019t go further in their social agenda and push more ambitious legislation. During debate on the bill, which he ultimately voted for, Sanders went so far as to deride it as the \u201cso-called Inflation Reduction Act.\u201d The Republican National Committee even tweeted out video of Sanders\u2019 remarks. BERNIE SANDERS on the \u201cso-called Inflation Reduction Act\u201d: \u201cAccording to the CBO and other economic organizations that have studied this bill, it will, in fact, have a minimal impact on inflation.\u201d pic.twitter.com/gE9H2cJIggThe Penn Wharton Budget Model, a project of the University of Pennsylvania that aims to give Congressional Budget Office-type independent analyses of legislation, kicked off the criticism of the Inflation Reduction Act on July 29.It projected that the bill would actually boost inflation by 0.05 percentage point in 2024 and reduce it by 0.25 percentage point in \u201cthe late 2020s.\u201d\u201cThese point estimates, however, are not statistically different than zero, thereby indicating a very low level of confidence that the legislation will have any impact on inflation,\u201d according to the project\u2019s analysis.The nonpartisan CBO came to a similar conclusion. In a preliminary analysis released Aug. 4, CBO Director Phillip Swagel wrote, \u201cIn calendar year 2022, enacting the bill would have a negligible effect on inflation, in CBO\u2019s assessment,\u201d and in 2023 inflation would probably be 0.1 percentage point lower or higher than if the law was unchanged.The key, Swagel said, would be how the bill would affect various economic factors that determine inflation, including demand, the supply of workers, supply chain disruptions and the reaction by the Federal Reserve.And though the head of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, Kent Smetters, and Swagel both served in the George W. Bush administration (and in Swagel\u2019s case, also at the conservative American Enterprise Institute), their analyses have been seen as middle of the road. \u201cThese point estimates, however, are not statistically different than zero, thereby indicating a very low level of confidence that the legislation will have any impact on inflation.\u201d Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told HuffPost in an email that the inflation effects \u201care likely to be small.\u201dHowever, Goldwein said a side deal to loosen permitting restrictions on energy projects, such as pipelines and energy export facilities, would also help cut inflation.\u201cBut still, the effects are likely to be modest. And smaller in the final version of the bill than the original one,\u201d he said.Democrats say those projections are too pessimistic and don\u2019t give enough credit for the things the bill would do, like bring down prices on prescription drugs for seniors.\u201cI think that this gives us a chance to cut a lot of costs, and that\u2019s part of inflation,\u201d Senate Finance Committee chair Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) told reporters when the bill was on the Senate floor.For example, he said, \u201cas sure as night follows day,\u201d private insurers will want to negotiate prices with drugmakers after they see how much Medicare will be able to save by doing so.\u201cIf you\u2019re on the board of a private company and you look at what Medicare is doing, that board member will say to the CEO, \u2018You better go get me that. Medicare is doing it \u2014 why can\u2019t I have it?\u2019\u201d he said.The changes in the bill as it made it through the legislative process likely also reduced its effectiveness in something else Democrats have touted: cutting the budget deficit.The CBO initially scored the package as cutting more than $100 billion from the budget deficit over 10 years. For perspective, the last CBO baseline estimate projected $15.7 trillion in deficits over the next decade. CBO later revised down its estimate of the bill\u2019s effect to about $90.5 billion before the Senate began its debating. CRFB\u2019s Goldwein said the post-Senate version probably saw its deficit reduction cut even more, to somewhere around $70 billion.On Thursday, though, the CBO released a letter from Swagel saying the changes made since the bill\u2019s unveiling, which would include a narrowing of the prescription drug negotiation provision and a swapping out of tax provisions to preserve the carried interest loophole, meant they could not give it a final score for \u201ca few weeks.\u201dEven if one includes the extra $200 billion in tax revenue the CBO says can be expected from stepped up enforcement \u2015 which is prohibited from being in the formal score \u2015 the effect on the deficit would be relatively small.But Goldwein said the bill was significant in how it had been pared back from a more expensive proposal last year with much more gimmicky pay-fors.\u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act, though not perfect, moves in the direction of deficit reduction \u2015 something that hasn\u2019t happened in a serious way since 2011 (or 2013 relative to \u2018current policy\u2019),\u201d he said.Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPostTwo top House Democrats vying for New York\u2019s 12th Congressional District Democratic nomination on Wednesday expressed full-throated support for President Joe Biden\u2019s reelection as their party\u2019s 2024 nominee.Reps. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) last week dodged a debate question on whether Biden should seek a second term in office. But during Tuesday\u2019s debate hosted by PIX11 and Hunter College, both expressed confidence in another Biden run.\u201cI am supporting Joe Biden. He has announced that he is running,\u201d Maloney declared.Nadler, forced to run against Maloney in the newly redrawn congressional district, said Biden should \u201cabsolutely\u201d run in 2024.\u201cHe should be the Democratic nominee, and he should be reelected president,\u201d Nadler said. \u201cHe\u2019s done a magnificent job.\u201d While the White House and Biden himself have repeatedly said he intends to run, there has been no official campaign announcement.Last week, Maloney went on CNN to apologize to Biden for saying in an earlier debate she believed he would not pursue a second term.\u201cMr. President, I apologize. I want you to run,\u201d Maloney told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d Thursday. \u201cI happen to think you won\u2019t be running, but when you run or if you run, I will be there 100%.\u201dIn the same interview, Maloney insisted she had her own reasons for believing Biden would step down after the end of his current term.\u201cThat was just my own personal belief,\u201d Maloney told CNN. \u201cBut I will support him if he runs and it\u2019s totally his decision.\u201dNadler said in last week\u2019s debate that it was \u201ctoo early to say\u201d whether Biden should run again.Maloney and Nadler\u2019s reversal comes after a string of victories for Biden, including Senate passage a massive climate and health care bill Sunday, a successful U.S. operation killing al Qaeda Leader Ayman al-Zawahri, and a stunning U.S. jobs report showing U.S. employers restored all positions lost during COVID.Democrats hope the successes will help the party in this year\u2019s November midterm elections. Still, questions over a potential Biden 2024 campaign are not going away. Biden, America\u2019s oldest president, turns 80 in November and his approval rating remains low, hovering around 39%, according to FiveThirtyEight.Maloney, 76, Nadler, 75, and Suraj Patel, 38, are competing in the same Democratic primary race after a court struck down New York Democrats\u2019 redistricting lines.Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Political Reporter, HuffPostThe calls for transparency came quickly after Monday\u2019s FBI raid of Mar-A-Lago, the home and social club of former President Donald Trump in Palm Beach, Florida.Trump supporters in elected office demanded explanations from the Justice Department for the unprecedented search of the home of a former president \u2015 and potential electoral rival for the sitting president. \u201cWhy are the FBI and DOJ refusing to comment after raiding the private home of a former U.S. President?\u201d Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), a staunch Trump ally, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThe American people demand transparency \u2014 they do not want another political witch hunt of President Trump.\u201d Even Republicans who opposed Trump wanted more details \u2015 why was Mar-A-Lago raided? And why was it raided now? \u2015 out of the agency, often arguing the unprecedented move required the Justice Department to put aside standard procedure.\u201cThese are unprecedented circumstances that require unprecedented transparency and accountability from our government institutions,\u201d said Maryland GOP Gov. Larry Hogan, a frequent critic of Trump who is considering a 2024 presidential bid. \u201cThe American people deserve to know all the facts as soon as possible, and I call on the Biden administration to release \u2015 at a minimum \u2015 the documents authorizing the FBI search.\u201d The Justice Department, however, is sticking to its strict rules against discussing ongoing investigations, amid recent experiences seeing how violations of those rules can quickly create unintended consequences. The calls for transparency are likely to go unanswered, at least in the short-term.But there is someone who is free to provide more information: Trump. While Trump was not at Mar-A-Lago during the raid, FBI agents would have supplied one of his lawyers and employees with both a search warrant outlining the justification for the search and an inventory of everything agents ultimately seized. The former president is free to release those documents. Some details have leaked out, both from Trump and from unnamed sources with knowledge of the investigation. Trump said the FBI broke into his safe, for instance, and multiple news outlets have reported the search dealt with an investigation into Trump\u2019s decision to remove 15 boxes of White House documents, some of them classified, and bring them to Mar-A-Lago rather than with the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into the Jan. 6 insurrection.Tim Purdon, a former U.S. Attorney for North Dakota during the Obama administration, explained the Justice Department\u2019s relative silence this way: Imagine the opposite scenario.\u201cLet\u2019s say Merrick Garland had appeared at a press conference at the gates of Mar-A-Lago and told the American people all of the evidence that made up the probable cause warrant in this case,\u201d Purdon said. \u201cMany, many people would say \u2018How dare the AG, the Justice Department go on and say they have this evidence without filing an indictment? They\u2019re taking away the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u2019\u201dPurdon\u2019s imagined reaction does reflect the bad faith in which many Republican elected officials were certain to deploy if the Justice Department moved against Trump. But what about Trump opponents like Hogan, who feel an unprecedented step requires unprecedented disclosures and explanations? Purdon says they likely won\u2019t have to wait for long.\u201cThis seems to be the sort of investigatory, law enforcement action you take not at the beginning of an investigation, but very close to the end of an investigation,\u201d Purdon said. \u201cSo who\u2019s to say that the government is not going to speak and be transparent sometime in the short term here?\u201dAnd recent history shows the pratfalls of breaking from that policy: Former FBI Director James Comey, trying to maintain his independence from the Justice Department under then-President Barack Obama, repeatedly spoke out regarding the agency\u2019s investigation into the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The famous \u201cComey letter,\u201d released weeks before the 2016 election, may have tipped the election to Trump.After Trump fired Comey, now-FBI Director Christopher Wray said at his confirmation hearing he would not release derogatory information about suspects, satisfying both Democrats angry at the FBI\u2019s treatment of Clinton and Republicans frustrated with leaks regarding the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia. In the meantime, however, some Democrats \u2015 who did not want to openly comment on an investigation they know little about \u2015 are fretting that the silence from the FBI and Justice Department could be filled with misinformation generated by Trump and his allies. That\u2019s part of the reason why some Democrats have begun calling on Trump to release the warrant and inventory from the search, a step he\u2019s so far declined to take. \u201cDonald Trump has a copy of the search warrant. He\u2019d show us the warrant if he were so wronged,\u201d Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) wrote on Twitter. \u201cShow it or shut it.\u201dWhenever the public does learn more about the search \u2015 both its cause and results \u2015 Purdon is confident the Justice Department made the right move.\u201cThe top folks at DOJ are not exactly riverboat gamblers,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to be the most scrutinized search warrant in the history of the Justice Department.\u201dSenior Political Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Rudy Giuliani will not appear as scheduled Tuesday before a special grand jury in Atlanta that\u2019s investigating whether former President Donald Trump and others illegally tried to interfere in the 2020 general election in Georgia, his lawyer said.A judge last month had ordered Giuliani, a Trump lawyer and former New York City mayor, to appear before the special grand jury Tuesday.But Giuliani\u2019s attorney, Robert Costello, told The Associated Press on Monday that Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who\u2019s overseeing the special grand jury, had excused Giuliani for the day.Nothing in publicly available court documents indicates that Giuliani is excused from appearing, but McBurney has scheduled a hearing for 12:30 p.m. Tuesday to hear arguments on a court filing from Giuliani seeking to delay his appearance. In a court filing Monday, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis asked the judge to deny Giuliani\u2019s request for a delay and to instruct him to appear before the special grand jury as ordered.Willis opened an investigation early last year, and a special grand jury with subpoena power was seated in May at her request.Last month she filed petitions seeking to compel testimony from seven Trump advisers and associates, including Giuliani. Because they don\u2019t live in Georgia, she had to use a process that involves getting a judge in the state where they live to order them to appear.New York Supreme Court Justice Thomas Farber on July 13 issued an order directing Giuliani to appear before the special grand jury on Aug. 9 and on any other dates ordered by the court in Atlanta.Giuliani\u2019s legal team last week asked Willis\u2019 office to delay his appearance, saying he was unable to travel because of a medical procedure. That request was rejected after Willis\u2019 team found evidence on social media that he had traveled since his medical procedure.A Giuliani attorney then clarified to Willis\u2019s team that Giuliani is not cleared for air travel, but Willis still refused to postpone his appearance, the motion says.In her Monday court filing, Willis wrote that her team had obtained records indicating that between July 19 and July 21, Giuliani bought multiple airline tickets, including tickets to Rome, Italy, and Zurich, Switzerland, for travel dates between July 22 and July 29. Willis said her team offered to provide alternative transportation \u2014 including bus or train fare \u2014 if Giuliani wasn\u2019t cleared for air travel.Giuliani had also offered to appear virtually, for example by Zoom, his motion says.\u201cIt is important to note here that Mr. Giuliani is no way seeking to inappropriately delay, or obstruct these proceedings or avoid giving evidence or testimony that is not subject to some claim of privilege in this matter,\u201d the motion says, noting that Giuliani had appeared virtually before the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and testified for more than nine hours.\u201cMr. Giuliani is willing to do the same here under conditions that replicate a grand jury proceeding,\u201d the motion says.In the petition for Giuliani\u2019s testimony, Willis identified him as both a personal attorney for Trump and a lead attorney for his campaign.She wrote that he and others presented a Georgia state Senate subcommittee with a video recording of election workers that Giuliani alleged showed them producing \u201csuitcases\u201d of unlawful ballots from unknown sources, outside the view of election poll watchers.Within 24 hours of that hearing on Dec. 3, 2020, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger\u2019s office had debunked the video and said that it had found that no voter fraud had taken place at the site. Nevertheless, Giuliani continued to make statements to the public and in subsequent legislative hearings claiming widespread voter fraud using that debunked video, Willis wrote.Evidence shows that Giuliani\u2019s appearance and testimony at the hearing \u201cwas part of a multi-state, coordinated plan by the Trump Campaign to influence the results of the November 2020 election in Georgia and elsewhere,\u201d the petition says.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostA new book claims that former President Donald Trump verbalized his disdain for wounded veterans early on in his presidency.The authors of \u201cThe Divider: Trump in the White House, 2017-2021,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Peter Baker and The New Yorker\u2019s Susan B. Glasser, detailed an exchange Trump had with his then-chief of staff John Kelly in which the former president expressed interest in copying the grandeur he witnessed during a French military parade. He just wanted to make one key tweak, according to an excerpt published by The New Yorker.In 2017, Trump flew to Paris for Bastille Day celebrations held by Emmanuel Macron, the then-new French president. The celebration was also meant to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the American entrance into the WWI. Due to this, Macron apparently wanted to appeal to Trump\u2019s love for opulence with a grandiose military display, which included vintage tanks rolling down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es as fighter jets flew overhead.When Trump returned to Washington, D.C., he asked his generals to throw him an even showier military parade for July 4. Part of his vision for improving on France\u2019s spectacular martial display was apparently by barring veterans who were wounded or used a wheelchair from his parade.\u201cLook, I don\u2019t want any wounded guys in the parade,\u201d Trump allegedly told Kelly, noting with \u201cdistaste\u201d that visibly injured veterans were featured in the French parade. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t look good for me.\u201dKelly \u2014 a retired Marine Corps general \u2014 was apparently flabbergasted by the idea.\u201cThose are the heroes,\u201d Kelly told Trump, according to the book. \u201cIn our society, there\u2019s only one group of people who are more heroic than they are \u2014 and they are buried over in Arlington.\u201dThe book noted that Kelly did not mention that his son, Robert \u2014 a lieutenant killed in action in Afghanistan \u2014 was among those buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. \u201cI don\u2019t want them,\u201d Trump apparently repeated. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good for me.\u201dTrump \u2014 who dodged the Vietnam War draft \u2014 has a history of disrespecting veterans, especially those who have died or have been injured.In 2020, The Atlantic reported that Trump referred to American service members who died in WWI as \u201closers\u201d and \u201csuckers\u201d in conversations with his senior staff during a trip to France in 2018.While on the trip, he turned down a planned visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery \u2015 a WWI cemetery in Belleau, France, near the site of the Battle of Belleau Wood.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2015 In an odd spectacle on Sunday, Senate Democrats argued among themselves and overwhelmingly voted against one of their own top policy priorities before coming together to pass one of the landmark bills of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency.Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) tried to amend the bill to include an extension of the monthly child allowance that Democrats enacted on a temporary basis last year, but couldn\u2019t continue due to opposition from Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). \u201cPathetically, the United States has the highest child poverty rate of almost any major country on Earth,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cUnfortunately for the millions of working parents who benefited from this program, it expired in December.\u201dSens. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Michael Bennet (D-Col.), two of the strongest proponents of the child tax credit, rose in opposition to Sanders\u2019 amendment \u2015 not because they didn\u2019t like it, but because its adoption would have jeopardized the cheaper prescription drugs and billions for green energy promised by the Inflation Reduction Act. \u201cI ask my great colleagues to vote no because this will bring the bill down,\u201d Brown said. Nevertheless, Sanders persisted, asking Brown to explain how the child tax credit would harm the broader bill. Brown said that all 50 Senate Democrats supported the legislation and suggested that adding the child tax credit would cost them their unanimity. \u201cWe know that this is a fragile arrangement, and we\u2019ve got to pass it,\u201d Brown said. As the Senate\u2019s presiding officer explained Brown\u2019s time was up, the gravelly-voiced Ohio Democrat could be heard on C-SPAN grumbling about his colleague: \u201cCome on, Bernie,\u201d he said. The Sanders amendment then failed by a vote of 97 to 1 \u2015 one of dozens of amendments rejected by the Senate.The expanded child tax credit Democrats created in 2021 paid parents as much as $300 per child each month. For six months, the credit dramatically reduced child poverty and gave American parents a taste of the kind of child allowance that for decades has been a standard part of the welfare state in other rich countries. But Manchin complained that parents in his state wasted the money on drugs, and refused to go along with a bill continuing the benefit as part of the \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d agenda after 2021. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) continued negotiating with Manchin on the parts of Build Back Better that he could support, such as investments in green energy and allowing Medicare to negotiate prescription drugs, and their talks ultimately resulted in the Senate passing the Inflation Reduction Act on Sunday. Bennet said Sunday he would work with \u201cpeople on both sides of the aisle\u201d to make the enhanced child tax credit permanent, but it remains to be seen whether a critical mass of Republicans would ever support a monthly allowance for parents. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has proposed a different version of the Democrats\u2019 child tax credit with the cost of the program offset by consolidating and eliminating other safety net programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Romney\u2019s proposal would also exclude benefits for parents with no incomes, likely blunting some of its antipoverty impact. Romney has had informal conversations with Bennet and Brown and said he thought more formal negotiations could begin after the Senate\u2019s August recess. He also said he thought he could win over more than the two Republicans who had signed on to his proposal so far. \u201cWe\u2019re not in a big hurry,\u201d Romney told HuffPost. \u201cWe anticipate that this will probably be a number of months before something like this gets adopted.\u201dThe White House has \u201cshown interest\u201d in his proposal, Romney said, but he didn\u2019t know if President Biden would support it. The White House did not respond to a request for comment. It\u2019s not clear how much energy there will be to strike another bipartisan deal after senators previously collaborated on gun control and subsidies for the domestic computer chip industry. Republicans may prefer to avoid giving Biden another legislative victory ahead of midterm elections that could boost their ranks in the House and Senate. Romney wouldn\u2019t say if he thought the overturning of Roe v. Wade, and the loss of abortion access for millions of women, would spur more Republicans to support parents. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for our party to talk about not just poverty but about family and encouraging helping families that are having children,\u201d Romney said.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Political Reporter, HuffPostThe Senate failed to cap sky-high prices for insulin on sunday as part of the Democrats\u2019 climate and health legislation.A majority voted for it \u2015 57 senators \u2015 but it wasn\u2019t enough under the Senate\u2019s 60-vote rule for passage.Yet just a few hours later, the Senate successfully protected subsidiaries of private equity companies from a new 15% corporate minimum tax rate included in the legislation.It received the same number of votes as the insulin cap amendment, but this time the Senate rules required only a simple majority to pass it.The difference in fate between the two votes, both of which received support from same-sized majorities, shows how the Senate\u2019s arcane and frequently arbitrary rules often add to an already malapportioned legislative body\u2019s bias toward powerful interests. People with diabetes looking for help to afford lifesaving medication need a supermajority, while a simple majority is just fine for private equity managers looking to protect their fruitful investments.Most Democrats, up to a somewhat reluctant President Joe Biden, have been prepared to scrap or severely weaken the filibuster rule, the extra-constitutional provision requiring 60 votes to end debate in the Senate that has come to function as a supermajority requirement for almost all legislation. But Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) have blocked any attempted reforms. The combined effect of Senate rules is to create additional chokepoints for interest groups to exploit. It\u2019s not a coincidence that every major piece of economic legislation passed through the Senate during Biden\u2019s administration had the backing of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents America\u2019s largest and most powerful businesses, until Sunday\u2019s passage of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act. The bill raises taxes on investors and large corporations, and spends the cash reducing the deficit and investing in clean energy and health care subsidies, while also giving Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs. The House is expected to pass the legislation and send it to Biden later this week.Passing the bill on a party-line vote in the 50-50 Senate meant Democrats were relying on what\u2019s called budget reconciliation. But reconciliation requires every provision of the bill to have a direct and substantial effect on the federal budget, making it useless for many social policies and any economic ones without a direct effect on federal taxation or spending.The provision to cap insulin prices would have limited co-pays for insulin at $35 a month for people on private health insurance plans. But the Senate\u2019s parliamentarian, an unelected official accountable only to members of the upper chamber, ruled it fell outside of what\u2019s allowed under reconciliation.That meant the GOP could challenge it, and Democrats would need to round up 10 Republicans to keep it in the bill. Seven Republicans, all representing states with large swatches of rural poverty, joined Democrats: Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, John Kennedy and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi. But it wasn\u2019t enough.Insulin prices have spiked in recent years, and Americans pay as much as 10 times more than what the drug costs in other economically developed countries. Four-fifths of diabetics who take insulin say the cost of the drug causes them financial hardship. \u201cThis won\u2019t just save money, it will save lives,\u201d Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said on the floor before the vote. \u201cThis should not be a hard vote to cast.\u201dThe legislation still limits insulin co-pays to $35 a month for people who use Medicare, and Democrats have promised a stand-alone vote on legislation sponsored by Republican Susan Collins and Democrat Jeanne Shaheen (N.H.) to keep costs low. But unless three additional Republicans are willing to back the legislation, it will fail under the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold. Two of the world\u2019s largest drug companies, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, have been some of the biggest beneficiaries of rising insulin costs. Since the beginning of Democratic control of Congress in 2021, the two companies have spent massive sums lobbying against cost controls: Eli Lilly has spent $11.4 million, according to federal lobbying records, while Novo Nordisk has spent $5.8 million. The private equity amendment, on the other hand, was backed by a powerful industry with a powerful ally in Sinema, who had already forced Democrats to strip out an effort to tighten a loophole abused by the industry. The Arizona freshman feared the minimum tax would hit small- and medium-sized businesses with private equity backing, with a spokesman saying her goal was to \u201ctarget tax avoidance, make the tax code more efficient, and support Arizona\u2019s economic growth and competitiveness.\u201dOther Democrats said Sinema\u2019s concerns were nonsensical: Unless the businesses had more than $1 billion in revenue, they would be untouched. \u201cI don\u2019t know very many small businesses at home that have a profit of a billion dollars a year,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, told reporters on Saturday night. \u201cThis is a very small number of businesses.\u201dStill, with Sinema\u2019s support and the amendment\u2019s passage assured, six other Democrats facing potentially tough reelection battles in coming years \u2013 Mark Kelly of Arizona, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia, Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire \u2015 voted for it, hoping to avoid the industry\u2019s wrath in the future. Though Sunday\u2019s dueling votes provided a clear example, the powerful have long abused Senate rules. When senators were still chosen by state legislatures in the 1800s, wealthy men often bribed local officials to gain entrance to the chamber, a practice that culminated in Montana in 1899, when two mining magnates each spent $1 million on bribes hoping to win a Senate election. In the first half of the 20th century, Southern senators filibustered every single attempt at civil rights legislation.In more recent years, decisions by Democrats and Republicans to eliminate the filibuster for judicial and executive branch nominations has meant Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell could enact much of his agenda \u2015 passing tax cuts and appointing judges \u2015 with a simple majority, while more complicated Democratic goals, on issues from gun control to health care to voting rights, still require 60-vote pledges.As recently as December 2021, the Senate listened to cries of panic from business leaders and passed a one-time exception to the filibuster to raise the debt limit with fewer than 60 votes.The Senate is already far from a paragon of democracy: It grants states with small populations wildly disproportionate power over American politics, giving the typical rural American 37% more power than the average voter when it comes to determining control of the Senate. Small states are also far less racially diverse than bigger ones, meaning the typical Black voter has 17% less influence over who controls the Senate than an average voter, and a typical Hispanic voter has 33% less influence. The filibuster exacerbates the bias toward smaller states: The six senators who represent California, New York and Texas represent the same number of people as the 62 senators who represent the union\u2019s 31 smallest states, more than enough to sustain a filibuster. Senate rules also weaken the federal government\u2019s hands when it comes to combating state and local governments who abuse their powers: While GOP-controlled states passed a wave of voting rights restrictions this year, Democratic plans to pass legislation overriding them at the federal level were stymied by Manchin\u2019s and Sinema\u2019s insistence on protecting the filibuster.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The stylized action romp \u201cBullet Train,\u201d starring Brad Pitt, arrived with a $30.1 million opening weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday, as the last big movie of Hollywood\u2019s summer recovery landed in theaters.The \u201cBullet Train\u201d debut for Sony Pictures was solid but unspectacular for a movie that cost $90 million to make and was propelled by Pitt\u2019s substantial star power. Even if it holds well in coming weeks, movie theaters have no major studio releases on the horizon for the rest of August, and few sure things to look forward to in early fall.While late summer is always a quiet period in theaters, it will be especially so this year \u2014 and likely to sap some of the momentum stirred by \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d \u201cJurassic World: Dominion,\u201d \u201cMinions: The Rise of Gru\u201d and others. After a comeback season that pushed the box office close to pre-pandemic levels, it\u2019s about to get pretty quiet in cinemas.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be quieter, like the calm after the storm,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not going to be great movies out there and perhaps the good will generated by some of those films might be enough to buoy the box office until we get into the blockbuster corridor with \u2018Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\u2019 and \u2018Avatar 2\u2019 down the road. We have to expect that we\u2019re not going to be able to keep up the pace we had this summer.\u201dAs the last big summer movie to leave the station, \u201cBullet Train\u201d hopes to keep riding for the coming weeks. That would be in line with the playbook of some other original, August-released summer movies like \u201cFree Guy\u201d and \u201cCrazy Rich Asians.\u201d Directed by David Leitch (\u201cAtomic Blonde,\u201d \u201cDeadpool 2\u201d), \u201cBullet Train\u201d gathers a number of assassins (co-stars include Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry) together on a speeding train running from Tokyo to Kyoto.As one of the few original would-be summer blockbusters without big-name intellectual property behind it, the R-rated \u201cBullet Train\u201d might have come into the weekend with more momentum if reviews had been stronger. With a low 54% fresh rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes, \u201cBullet Train\u201d was only slightly better received by audiences, who gave the film a B+ CinemaScore. The film added $32.4 million in overseas box office.The weekend\u2019s other new wide release, \u201cEaster Sunday,\u201d struggled to catch on. The Universal Pictures comedy, starring comic Jo Koy as an actor attending his family\u2019s Easter Sunday celebration, won praise for its Filipino representation but drew even worse reviews than \u201cBullet Train.\u201d It opened with $5.3 million in ticket sales.Instead, \u201cBullet Train\u201d was trailed by a number of holdovers, including Warner Bros.\u2032 \u201cDC League of Pets.\u201d The animated release grossed $11.2 million in its second week of release.Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cNope,\u201d the Universal sci-fi horror release, continued to perform well, earning $8.5 million in its third weekend. With $98 million in tickets sold, \u201cNope\u201d will soon surpass $100 million at the domestic box office.Taika Waititi\u2019s \u201cThor: Love and Thunder,\u201d for the Walt Disney Co., came in fourth with $7.6 million in its fifth weekend. It\u2019s now up to $316.1 million, making it the highest grossing Thor movie domestically. With $699 million globally, \u201cLove and Thunder\u201d is less likely to catch the $854 million worldwide haul of 2017\u2032s \u201cThor: Ragnarok.\u201dIn limited release, A24\u2032s \u201cBodies Bodies Bodies\u201d launched on six screens in New York and Los Angeles with $226,525 in ticket sales, good for a per-screen average of $37,754. The horror comedy about rich 20-somethings at a remote house party, with a cast including Amandla Sternberg, Maria Bakalova and Pete Davidson, expands nationwide on Friday.Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior National Correspondent, HuffPostLisa McRipley has been living with multiple sclerosis for more than a decade. And although the condition eventually forced her to leave the workforce and move from California to be with family in Michigan, she has remained active \u2015 volunteering with MS advocacy groups, participating in church activities \u2015 with the help of medication that slows the disease\u2019s progression and reduces the severity of symptoms.But the treatment is expensive, and McRipley\u2019s drug coverage, through Medicare, leaves her on the hook for hundreds of dollars, and sometimes more than a thousand dollars, in out-of-pocket costs when she fills the prescriptions at the pharmacy. Paying is a real struggle on a fixed income, McRipley told HuffPost in an interview, but going without the medication isn\u2019t an option, as she discovered the hard way this summer, when she stopped taking some of her pills briefly and within a week started losing mobility, dexterity and her sense of balance. \u201cI lost my ability to even hold a fork or a spoon to eat \u2015 it was like night and day,\u201d McRipley said. McRipley has resumed taking the medication, but, as is often the case with relapsing and remitting forms of MS, she fears she will never get back to where she was. And although McRipley can\u2019t be sure the medication pause is the reason her condition got worse, she is sure about how the cost of her drugs affects her life even when she\u2019s able to take them. \u201cIt\u2019s really upsetting because I have to ask for assistance, for things like groceries,\u201d McRipley said. \u201cI\u2019m asking my parents \u2026 and I should be in a position where I\u2019m helping them at this time, not the other way around.\u201dMcRipley\u2019s story is by no means unusual or limited to people with MS. High cost also appears to discourage Medicare beneficiaries with cancer, hepatitis C and certain immune disorders from taking their medications, according to a major paper that appeared in the journal Health Affairs earlier this year. And it wasn\u2019t the first study to document such effects.Democrats have been promising to help people like McRipley, and they may be on the verge of fulfilling that promise with the Inflation Reduction Act, which party leaders hope to pass in the coming days and send to President Joe Biden for his signature. The legislation includes several provisions designed to reduce what people pay at the pharmacy counter. The best-known and most controversial of these would give the federal government power to negotiate the prices of drugs that Medicare covers, which is something that the governments of other economically advanced countries already do and a big reason why pharmaceutical prices in those nations are so much lower than they are here.But only a limited number of drugs would be subject to negotiation under a process that wouldn\u2019t lead to lower prices for those drugs until 2026. Even then, drug prices in the U.S. would likely remain significantly higher than they are in peer countries, which means that Medicare beneficiaries like McRipley would still need more help, ideally sooner rather than later.And they may get it. The other prescription drug reforms of the Inflation Reduction Act have gotten a lot less attention, but several could have a big impact, including one that would put a hard limit on out-of-pocket drug expenses. It would phase in over two years, starting in 2024, so that by 2025, beneficiaries like McRipley would pay no more than $2,000 a year for drugs that now cost them many times more than that.McRipley said the provision could be a \u201clifesaver,\u201d which, if the studies are correct, is literally true. But that all depends on the bill actually passing. As of this writing, that is still no sure thing.The story of why Medicare beneficiaries owe so much for prescriptions goes back to 2003, when President George W. Bush signed the law that created Medicare\u2019s drug benefit, which is known as Part D. The program addressed a huge need. Prior to that, Medicare beneficiaries frequently couldn\u2019t find drug coverage. But the program\u2019s chief architects were Republicans and conservative Democrats who refused to give the federal government leverage over drug prices and weren\u2019t willing to spend what it would take to finance the kind of comprehensive benefit many seniors needed. As a result, Part D has big gaps in its coverage, exposing seniors to significant deductibles, copayments and coinsurance.The Affordable Care Act, which President Barack Obama signed in 2010, addressed the problem partly by gradually eliminating one of the big gaps in coverage \u2015 or closing the \u201cdoughnut hole,\u201d as it had come to be known. The 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act, which President Donald Trump signed, accelerated the process.\u201cThese [drugs] aren't optional for people. These are what you need to extend your life or to prevent you from getting sicker.\u201dBut even with those reforms fully in place, Medicare beneficiaries remain responsible for a fraction of their drug costs with no limit on the total.The portion is small, just 5% once drug spending reaches a certain threshold. But some drugs have such high list prices \u2015 tens, even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year \u2015 that the 5% becomes punishing, enough to deter patients from taking the drugs altogether.\u201cI think there is this perception that just because someone is on Medicare, they\u2019re covered and most of their prescription drug costs and other kinds of costs are covered,\u201d said Amy Niles, executive vice president of the PAN Foundation, which provides financial assistance to people who can\u2019t afford their medical bills. \u201cBut when it comes to prescription medications, that\u2019s not the case. So for people on Medicare \u2026 there is no limit to what you might pay out of pocket for these medications.\u201dThe study that appeared in Health Affairs earlier this year shows just how severe the effects can be. Among Medicare beneficiaries who weren\u2019t eligible for extra government assistance, nearly 1 in 3 were failing to fill the new prescriptions, researchers found.\u201cWe know that these are critically important drugs, many of them the first-line treatment recommendation,\u201d Vanderbilt associate professor and lead author Stacie Dusetzina told HuffPost. \u201cSo these aren\u2019t optional for people. These are what you need to extend your life or to prevent you from getting sicker. The fact that it\u2019s nearly 1 in 3, that is just mind-blowing.\u201dNot all drugs that Medicare beneficiaries need translate to such high individual costs. It\u2019s mainly the drugs that individual beneficiaries purchase directly at pharmacies using their Part D coverage. Infusions and other drugs they get at doctor\u2019s offices and clinics usually fall under Medicare Part B, which pays for outpatient services, and the cost-sharing in Part B is typically much lower because most beneficiaries have supplemental coverage or out-of-pocket limits on medical spending.To illustrate the illogic of that distinction, Dusetzina has cited the example of breast cancer. The treatment for one common type, known as HER2-negative cancer, is a drug that people take orally. For Medicare beneficiaries, annual out-of-pocket costs can exceed $10,000. The treatment for a different variant, HER2-positive breast cancer, is an infusion, which for most Medicare beneficiaries will cost a fraction of that amount.\u201cIt means you might be feeling lucky that you have a cancer that\u2019s treated with infusions instead of pills,\u201d Dusetzina said. \u201cIt makes no sense at all.\u201dJoan Durnell Powell doesn\u2019t need a study to tell her about the high cost of drugs and the choices it forces upon patients. Powell is a retiree in California who in 2014 got a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes, a class of blood disorders. The medications she\u2019s taken have kept her alive, she said in an interview, but with out-of-pocket costs that run into four and frequently five figures.Like many Medicare beneficiaries, Powell has gotten help from several private charities, including the PAN Foundation, that assist people who can\u2019t afford their drugs. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for the support of these foundations, I literally wouldn\u2019t be living.\u201d But sometimes the grants expire or the paperwork doesn\u2019t get through, Powell said, and even when the money is there, it covers only some of the bills.Today, she said, she still has to come up with about $5,000 to $6,000 a year \u2015 on a fixed annual income of less than $30,000. \u201cAnytime I tell people about this, I say I don\u2019t have to worry about my disease. I have to worry about my co-pay.\u201dThe limits on what the charities can provide are why those organizations have lined up with Patients for Affordable Drugs, FamiliesUSA and other health care advocacy groups to support the proposed out-of-pocket cap. They are equally enthusiastic about some related provisions in the Democratic legislation, including a proposed expansion of support for Medicare beneficiaries with low incomes.Like all policy proposals, the Democratic legislation comes with some trade-offs, which, in the case of the out-of-pocket cap and the low-income assistance, is primarily in the form of new government spending. In other words, the reason Medicare beneficiaries like McRipley and Powell would soon pay less for their drugs under the Democratic proposal is that the federal government would be assuming more of the financial burden directly.That helps explain why those two provisions are part of the same bill that calls for government negotiation of drug prices. The negotiation and some related provisions of the legislation would reduce Medicare spending because as the prices of individual drugs came down, Medicare wouldn\u2019t have to lay out as much money for them. \u201cI don\u2019t have to worry about my disease. I have to worry about my co-pay.\u201dThe drug industry and its allies, including Republicans and some Democrats, have warned that forcing down drug prices would reduce drug company profits, making it harder for them to attract the investment capital they need to finance the research and development of new drugs. Potentially that could mean fewer breakthrough drugs, as in the kind that now treat McRipley\u2019s MS and Powell\u2019s blood disorder.But analysts at the Congressional Budget Office have said they think the Democratic bill would likely have only a small effect on innovation. And while plenty of researchers think the effects could be larger, Dusetzina is among a large group that thinks the CBO got it right. \u201cI think the bill does a nice job of finding a balance \u2015 putting in guardrails around what drugs are eligible for negotiation and also targeting only a small number of drugs to start,\u201d Dusetzina said. \u201cSo the pharma industry\u2019s claims related to the loss of cures, I think, are dramatically overstated.\u201dOf course, the proposal won\u2019t have any effect on innovation \u2015 or on drug prices \u2015 if the Inflation Reduction Act doesn\u2019t get through Congress. And though all 50 senators in the Democratic caucus have now said they support the bill, clearing the way for passage, the drug industry is making one last, desperate push to break up the coalition.A lot is riding on the outcome. For some Medicare beneficiaries, it might even be a matter of life or death.Senior National Correspondent, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Politics Reporter, HuffPostIf Donald Trump runs for president a third time, Republicans on Capitol Hill will have to face all sorts of things they had hoped were gone forever \u2014 constantly having to answer for his tweets, worrying about being the target of his tweets and a return to the chaos parade that characterized his administration.But there\u2019s another possible twist that, so far at least, most Republicans in the Senate don\u2019t even want to think about: Trump running and then getting indicted for his Jan. 6 conduct. That would give the nation a modern political first \u2014 a major party candidate with a realistic chance of winning the nomination while facing a felony criminal charge.Republican senators say that so far, they have not given the idea much thought \u2014 at least not that they\u2019re willing to admit \u2014 and declined to say if an indictment for breaking the law would be disqualifying for a person vying to be constitutionally charged with carrying out the nation\u2019s laws.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about supposition. Wait till things happen and then we\u2019ll talk, OK?\u201d Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama told HuffPost this week.\u201cWow, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what the rules are,\u201d said Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio. \u201cI just haven\u2019t thought about it.\u201dThe possibility is not as far-fetched as it might sound. Trump has seemingly all but announced plans to run again, hinting broadly his supporters will be happy with his decision.At the same time, signs have emerged that the Department of Justice is further along than had been thought with its investigation of the Jan. 6 attempted insurrection and what role Trump played in it. On July 26, Washington Post reported that Trump was being investigated for possible crimes related to Jan. 6, and CNN reported recently that Trump\u2019s lawyers were in contact with the Justice Department about the probe and had warned Trump he could be charged.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about supposition. Wait till things happen and then we\u2019ll talk, OK?\u201d\u201cTrump\u2019s legal defense team has warned him that indictments are possible,\u201d CNN said, citing unspecified sources.As for Portman\u2019s question whether catching an indictment would be against the rules, there is nothing in the Republican Party\u2019s official rules that mentions indictments or charges, nor in the last party platform adopted in 2016.That\u2019s different from even the House Republicans\u2019 rules, which explicitly say members of the party have to resign from their committee seats if indicted. In other words, an indictment could force a rank-and-file House Republican to resign from the third-tier House Budget Committee but have no formal impact on who can run for the party\u2019s presidential nomination.Of GOP senators who had an opinion on what should happen if Trump runs as an indicted candidate, the feelings ranged the full spectrum. Sen. Rick Scott (Fla.), who heads the National Republican Senatorial Campaign charged with winning back the chamber for the GOP, said the call whether to run was Trump\u2019s.\u201cThis is a choice that President Trump gets to make and that the voters get to decide,\u201d he told HuffPost.Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), a 2016 candidate for president, said an indictment would just be akin to criminalizing political differences.\u201cI think prosecuting someone for their political beliefs or stances is not appropriate in a democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether or not you think the governor should approve the electors or the Secretary of State or the state legislature sounds like a political point of view.\u201dSen. Lisa Murkowski, the Alaska Republican in a battle for reelection against a Trump-endorsed opponent, said talk of an indicted Trump running was \u201ctalking about scenarios way far down the road.\u201dBut asked if she thought an indictment would be disqualifying, Murkowski said, \u201cSure.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201dFlorida\u2019s Marco Rubio, another GOP presidential candidate Trump defeated in 2016, declined to comment, saying \u201cI\u2019m not doing any of that speculative stuff.\u201dGOP leaders were also quiet on the question. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s (Ky.) office declined to comment, though McConnell has hinted in the past Trump may be a nonissue for the GOP because it will have a \u201ccrowded field\u201d of potential 2024 nominees.A request for comment with House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s office was not returned.One former Democratic presidential candidate did have an opinion, though. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), one of the last of the 2020 Democratic candidates to fall before President Joe Biden won the party\u2019s nomination, said it shouldn\u2019t take a formal charge to bar Trump.\u201cTrump should be disqualified by the American voters who, by this point, should be appalled by all that has come out,\u201d she said.\u201cIf the Republicans want to embrace a person under indictment for treasonous acts against the United States of America, then no one can stop them,\u201d Warren added.\u201cThe Republicans have gone so far out that the American people \u2014 and that includes Democrats, Republicans and independents \u2014 have said, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going there with you.\u2019\u201dPolitics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

But the new song, which the singer has yet to confirm or deny is about the \u201cThat \u201970s Show\u201d alum, paints a decidedly different picture and contains lyrics about a troubling relationship with a much older boyfriend seemingly aimed at Valderrama.\u201cPetal on the vine / Too young to drink wine / Just five years of bleeders, student and a teacher,\u201d she sings on the track, which was posted on TikTok by Demi_Artistry. \u201cFar from innocent / What the fuck\u2019s consent? / Numbers told you not to / But that didn\u2019t stop you.\u201d\u201cFinally 29 / Funny, just like you were at the time / Thought it was a teenage dream, just a fantasy / But was it yours or was it mine? / 17, 29.\u201dLovato, who recently announced is once again using she/her pronouns, previously shared how the two first crossed paths while filming a PSA together back in 2010, when she was 17 and \u2015 yes, you guessed it \u2015 he was right around 29 years old. \u201cOf course, I was like, \u2018Oh my god.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 The husband of U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi pleaded not guilty Wednesday to misdemeanor driving under the influence charges related to a May car crash in Northern California wine country. Paul Pelosi, 82, did not appear in person at Napa County Superior Court Wednesday. His attorney Amanda Bevins entered not guilty pleas for him on charges of driving under the influence of alcohol causing injury and driving with a .08% blood alcohol level or higher causing injury.State law allows for DUI misdemeanor defendants to appear through their attorney unless ordered otherwise by the court. He was arrested following a May 28 crash in Napa County, north of San Francisco, after a DUI test showed he had a blood alcohol content level of .082%. The blood sample was taken about two hours after the collision occurred at 10:17 p.m., the Napa County District Attorney\u2019s Office said in a statement.Pelosi was driving a 2021 Porsche into an intersection near the wine country town of Yountville that was hit by a 2014 Jeep, according to the California Highway Patrol.Prosecutors filed the case as a misdemeanor because of the injuries sustained by the 48-year-old driver of the Jeep. They have not described the injuries or provided more information about the other driver, saying the person has requested privacy. Pelosi was released on $5,000 bail after his arrest.If convicted, Pelosi faces up to a minimum of five days in jail and up to five years of probation. He would also be required to complete a drinking driver class and install an ignition interlock device in his vehicle \u2014 a breathalyzer that requires the driver to blow into it before operating the vehicle, prosecutors said. Pelosi has been married to the powerful Democratic speaker since 1963. She is traveling in Asia this week. \nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Pitt, who co-produced the movie, weighed in on the conversation during a recent stop of his linen-forward press tour for his action comedy film \u201cBullet Train.\u201d\u201cShe is phenomenal in it,\u201d Pitt told Entertainment Tonight about de Armas on Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough dress to fill.\u201dThe Oscar winner went on to impress just how key de Armas was to making the film work, given how other actors, including Jessica Chastain and Naomi Watts, were all previously attached to star as Monroe in the film. \u201cIt was 10 years in the making,\u201d Pitt said of the project, which was based on the novel by Joyce Carol Oates of the same name. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until we found Ana that we could get it across the finish line.\u201dThe film, which has received a rare NC-17 rating, took an unflinching approach to exploring the psyche of the screen legend, weaving both fictional and historical strands into a story about trauma and exploitation.Many have been skeptical of de Armas\u2019 casting from the onset, but the scrutiny only intensified after the official trailer revealed how the star recreated Monroe\u2019s signature breathy tone. Some fans were up in arms over de Armas\u2019 accent appearing to break through in certain moments.On the heels of the trailer\u2019s release, Monroe\u2019s estate, which is owned by a conglomerate of brands, came to her defense amid the controversy.\u201cAny actor that steps into that role knows they have big shoes to fill,\u201d Marc Rosen, president of entertainment at Authentic Brands Group (ABG), told Variety in a statement. \u201cBased on the trailer alone, it looks like Ana was a great casting choice as she captures Marilyn\u2019s glamour, humanity and vulnerability. We can\u2019t wait to see the film in its entirety!\u201dThe 34-year-old has previously spoken about the lengths she went to prepare for the role, including how she worked extensively to perfect the character\u2019s voice before even stepping onto the set. \u201cIt took me nine months of dialect coaching, and practicing and some ADR sessions,\u201d de Armas told The UK Times. \u201cIt was a big torture, so exhausting. My brain was fried.\u201dViewers will have their chance to judge de Armas\u2019 performance when \u201cBlonde\u201d arrives in the fall, but at least she also has \u201cKnives Out\u201d co-star Jamie Lee Curtis in her corner. The actor, whose father, Tony Curtis, famously starred alongside the real Monroe in \u201cSome Like It Hot,\u201d heaped praises upon de Armas after seeing an early cut of the film. \u201cI dropped to the floor,\u201d Curtis told Vanity Fair. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. Ana was completely gone. She was Marilyn.\u201dSee for yourself when \u201cBlonde\u201d hits Netflix on Sept. 28.Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostThe Senate on Tuesday passed a bill to expand health care and disability benefits to millions of veterans \u2014 less than a week after more than two dozen Republicans blocked it and drew outrage from the veterans\u2019 community, comedian Jon Stewart and others.The Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act, or the PACT Act, passed in a 86-11 vote. It now heads to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk to be signed into law.It should have passed the Senate last week. A similar version of the PACT Act passed the Senate in June, in an 84-14 vote. It\u2019s not particularly controversial: It would allow soldiers, sailors and airmen exposed to pits of burnt waste in combat zones to be covered by the Veterans Affairs health care system for related illnesses. Many of these vets got sick from exposure to burn pits during the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars.But last Wednesday, right after the news broke that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) had struck a deal on a massive tax and climate change package, 25 Republicans unexpectedly blocked the PACT Act despite previously voting to advance it. It made no sense, except in the context of Republicans having a full-blown tantrum about a Democratic deal they didn\u2019t like and taking out their anger on a totally unrelated veterans bill.Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) led the GOP effort to block the bill, saying he wanted to add an amendment related to budgetary spending.The GOP vote to block the bill spurred veterans to show up outside the Capitol in protest, some of whom had been camped outside of the building for days. Stewart, who has advocated on behalf of veterans for years, joined them and tore into Republicans as \u201cstab-vets-in-the-back senators.\u201d\u201cIf this is America first, then America is fucked,\u201d Stewart fumed.But on Tuesday, Republicans folded and agreed to move forward on the bill on the condition that they could get votes on three GOP amendments. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) wanted to reduce aid to other countries to help pay for the PACT Act. Toomey wanted to classify funding for the PACT Act as discretionary versus mandatory. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) wanted to shift veterans care into private community care.All of the amendments failed.Just before the bill passed, Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), the bill\u2019s sponsor, tweeted a video of Stewart hugging him and thanking him outside the Capitol for getting the bill done.\u201cMy man, pots and pans!\u201d Stewart shouted at Tester. \u201cYou brought this thing through and you made this happen,\u201d he said, walking with his arm around the senator. \u201cAnd these guys know that, and they appreciate it.\u201dSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostA multi-candidate Democratic primary in Manhattan has tightened considerably in recent weeks due to gains made by challenger Suraj Patel, according to a poll commissioned by Patel\u2019s campaign in late July.The survey of Democratic primary voters in New York\u2019s 12th Congressional District found that after providing respondents a one-paragraph description of the three top candidates, Reps. Carolyn Maloney and Jerry Nadler each enjoy 31% support ahead of Patel with 25% support. Patel, an attorney and business ethics lecturer, is highlighting his improved standing since early June when an internal poll showed him with 19% support after providing respondents a brief description of Patel. \u201cWe\u2019ve tapped into both a moment and an argument for change here against two incumbents who are running campaigns that are very, very much backwards-looking at a time when people are looking for hope and light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d Patel told HuffPost.Patel\u2019s advance in his internal polling follows a month of television advertising. He beat Maloney and Nadler to the airwaves with his first ad in late June.The campaign\u2019s poll, conducted by Whitman Insight Strategies, used live phone and text-to-web questions among 300 likely Democratic primary voters. The margin of error was plus or minus 5.65 percentage points.There is a major caveat when assessing the significance of Patel\u2019s July poll, however.In June, Whitman Insight Strategies tested Patel\u2019s support without describing his candidacy, as well as after describing his candidacy. Without a description of his candidacy, Patel registered just 11% support in June.For the late July survey, the pollster decided to ask respondents about how they planned to vote only after describing Patel\u2019s candidacy. That decision suggests the campaign wanted to highlight only the number that would make Patel look more competitive.Primaries are often difficult to accurately poll. A race in late August decoupled from statewide intra-party contests could be especially tough to survey. (A federal judge required New York to postpone congressional primaries for about two months so candidates would have enough time to campaign in the new districts.)In New York\u2019s 12th, polling has been accordingly sparse. Maloney led Nadler by 10 points and Patel had just 4% support in a May survey conducted by Emerson College for PIX11.The primary in New York\u2019s 12th has been dominated by very public sniping between Nadler and Maloney, both of whom are approaching 30 years in Congress. Nadler has argued that he is more progressive than Maloney, noting his support for the Iran nuclear agreement and opposition to the Iraq War. Maloney has drawn on her career as a trailblazing female elected official to argue that she is best-equipped to confront the country\u2019s challenges following the Supreme Court decision overturning a federal right to abortion. She concludes her first TV ad with the words, \u201cYou cannot send a man to do a woman\u2019s job.\u201dPatel, an East Village resident who identifies as a \u201cpragmatic progressive,\u201d has proposed a suite of policies designed to combat inflation that he calls \u201dthe abundant society.\u201d He also espouses a non-interventionist foreign policy that is closer to Nadler\u2019s than Maloney\u2019s in orientation, and has attacked Maloney for previously amplifying skepticism of childhood vaccination regimens.Patel\u2019s main focus, however, has been in appealing to voters interested in a new generation of leadership, especially people living in parts of Manhattan that neither Maloney nor Nadler currently represent. The election will be a \u201creferendum on their effectiveness contrasted with a message for the future,\u201d Patel predicted.This is Patel\u2019s third consecutive campaign to unseat Maloney, who lives on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side. The contest fundamentally changed in April, however, when New York\u2019s top court struck down New York Democrats\u2019 redistricting lines and ordered the drawing of nonpartisan congressional and state Senate boundaries. The new, court-ordered maps that emerged in May placed Patel, Maloney and Nadler, a resident of Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side, in the same district. Rana Abdelhamid, a left-wing Google employee from Astoria, Queens, subsequently withdrew from the race, leaving the newcomer lane to Patel and Ashmi Sheth, a former bank regulator at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Maloney, Nadler and Patel are due to compete in a televised debate at 7 p.m. Tuesday on NY1.Early voting begins in New York\u2019s congressional primary elections on Aug. 13. Election Day is Aug. 23.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "OLATHE, Kan. (AP) \u2014 A rare Democrat in a deeply Republican state, U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas is one of the most vulnerable incumbents seeking reelection this year. In the final months of her congressional campaign, she is focusing on Republicans\u2019 strict opposition to abortion rights.An online ad she released last week highlights how Amanda Adkins, the Republican favored to emerge from Tuesday\u2019s primary for a rematch with David in November, opposed abortion without exceptions. The ad points to Adkins\u2019 support of an amendment to the Kansas Constitution on the ballot Tuesday that would make clear there is no right to abortion in the states.\u201cThere were a lot of people who would not have known that I have an opponent who is extreme on this issue,\u201d Davids, who beat Adkins in 2020, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s not hypothetical anymore.\u201dThat\u2019s a sign of how the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in June to repeal a woman\u2019s federal constitutional right to abortion has scrambled the political dynamics heading into the fall elections, when control of Congress is at stake. A half-dozen of the most vulnerable House members \u2014 all of them women, all representing swaths of suburban voters \u2014 see the issue as one that could help them win in an otherwise difficult political climate.In addition to Davids, these incumbents include Reps. Angie Craig of Minnesota, Cindy Axne of Iowa, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria of Virginia, and Susan Wilds of Pennsylvania. They all face Republican opponents who support the high court\u2019s abortion ruling. Some are contending with rivals who back efforts to ban abortion in all circumstances, including when the mother\u2019s life is at risk.It\u2019s unclear whether the focus on abortion alone may be enough to mean reelection for many of these Democrats, who are running at a time of high inflation and frustration with President Joe Biden\u2019s performance.\u201cIn a close, toss-up election, which I think all of these are, it can make a difference,\u201d said national pollster Christine Matthews, a self-described moderate who has worked for Republicans. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be what drives everyone to make a vote choice, but it will drive some people to make a vote choice.\u201dTwenty-two percent of U.S. adults named abortion or women\u2019s rights in an open-ended question as one of up to five problems they want the government to address in the next year, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in June. That has more than doubled since December.Since the Supreme Court decision, as state governments have moved to act on abortion rights, AP-NORC polling has found a majority of people in the United States saying they want Congress to pass legislation guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide.Overwhelming majorities also think states should allow abortion in specific cases, including if the health of the pregnant woman is endangered or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.Like those questioned overall, a majority of suburbanites think abortion should be legal in most or all cases, according to AP-NORC polling. Suburbanites also were slightly more likely than city residents and significantly more likely than people living in rural areas to say abortion or women\u2019s rights are among the top issues for the government to address, according to the AP-NORC poll from June.That\u2019s particularly important in districts such as Axne\u2019s in Iowa, which includes Des Moines\u2019 teeming suburbs. Dallas County, west of Des Moines, has been one of the country\u2019s fastest-growing counties since 2000, with the cornfields from decades ago now covered in new homes, schools and commercial developments.In an interview, Axne was adamant that she would make abortion a central theme of her campaign. Axne\u2019s GOP opponent is state Rep. Zach Nunn, who indicated in a primary debate that he opposes abortion without exceptions.\u201cI can\u2019t even believe I have to say this. I have an opponent who would let a woman die to bear a child,\u201d Axne said. \u201cThis is crap we don\u2019t see in this country. This is the stuff we talk about in other countries and women not having rights.\u201dIn Michigan, Rep. Elissa Slotkin faces state Sen. Tom Barrett, who supports only an exception to save a woman\u2019s life.\u201cThat\u2019s more extreme than the 1931 law that\u2019s on our books,\u201d Slotkin said in an interview. \u201cSo I think that that\u2019s an important contrast to make.\u201dThe Adkins, Barrett and Nunn campaigns did not reply to telephone, email and text messages seeking comment for this story.In Virginia, Yesli Vega, the Republican challenging Spanberger in a district that spans the suburbs of Washington, D.C., and Richmond, has not dismissed the debunked theory that pregnancy is unlikely in cases of rape. In audio published by Axios late last month, Vega was asked during a campaign event in May whether \u201cit\u2019s harder for a woman to get pregnant if she\u2019s been raped.\u201dVega responded, Axios reported, \u201cMaybe, because there\u2019s so much going on in the body. I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen any studies. But if I\u2019m processing what you\u2019re saying, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me, because it\u2019s not something that\u2019s happening organically. Right? You\u2019re forcing it.\u201dThe answer was reminiscent of what Todd Akin, a Missouri congressman who was the Republican nominee for Senate in 2012, said during that campaign. In discussing his opposition to exceptions for rape victims, Akin claimed, \u201cIf it\u2019s legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut the whole thing down.\u201dThe comments were viewed as a major contributor to his loss to Democrat Clare McCaskill, a vulnerable incumbent.In Virginia, Spanberger released a digital ad last week declaring that Vega\u2019s \u201cviews don\u2019t represent Virginia.\u201dEarlier, Spanberger had said Vega\u2019s comment was \u201cextreme and ignorant\u201d and \u201chorrifying and disrespectful to the millions of American women who have or will become pregnant due to sexual violence.\u201dOne of the Spanberger\u2019s campaign digital posts used this headline: \u201cRepublican congressional candidate pulls a Todd Akin on abortion.\u201dRepresentatives for Vega did not respond to messages seeking comment.Some Republicans warn that Democrats risk overplaying their hand.In Minnesota, for example, Craig is facing Republican Tyler Kistner, whom she narrowly beat in 2020 in a district that covers Minneapolis\u2019 southeastern suburbs.Craig has begun running digital ads attacking Kistner, who opposes abortion, but would allow for exceptions in cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother.\u201cTyler Kistner wants to take away our rights,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice proclaims in an ad.Kistner consultant Billy Grant said Craig is \u201ctrying to scare you\u201d and noted that the Republican\u2019s team is weighing a counter to the attack that portrays him as \u201cpro-life, but who understands both sides.\u201d\u201cThe rest of America really is not a single-issue voter on that and they are concerned about the economy,\u201d Grant said.___Follow AP for full coverage of the midterms at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections and on Twitter, https://twitter.com/ap_politics\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "The summer box office showed signs of slowing down this weekend as the animated \u201cDC League of Super-Pets\u201d opened in theaters across North America.The superhero spinoff about Superman\u2019s dog earned $23 million from 4,314 locations, according to studio estimates Sunday. Though slightly less than expected, it was still enough to capture the first-place spot and knock Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cNope\u201d into second place in its second weekend.Analysts had pegged \u201cDC League of Super-Pets\u201d for a $25 million launch, which was on the lower end for animated openings this summer. In June, the $50.6 million for \u201cLightyear\u201d was considered underwhelming for the $200 million Disney/Pixar movie. Then in early July, Universal\u2019s \u201cMinions: The Rise of Gru\u201d captured $107 million in its first three days.But \u201cSuper-Pets\u201d is more comparable to Universal\u2019s \u201cThe Bad Guys,\u201d which netted out with around $97 million domestic after a $23 million opening, and it\u2019s much, much stronger than Paramount\u2019s \u201cPaws of Fury: The Legend of Hank\u2019s\u201d $6.3 million debut several weeks ago.\u201cThis opening is a huge win for DC fans, the box office, WB and our filmmakers,\u201d said Jeff Goldstein, the studio\u2019s president of domestic distribution.\u201cDC League of Super-Pets\u201d was not intended to be a midsummer release. Originally, \u201cSuper-Pets\u201d had been slated for May, while this weekend was reserved for \u201cBlack Adam,\u201d Warner Bros.\u2019 other Dwayne Johnson superhero pic. But postproduction delays due to a backup at VFX houses forced \u201cBlack Adam\u201d to move back to October. Instead of giving up the prime date, the studio filled the open spot with a family-friendly title with an all-star voice cast, including Kevin Hart, John Krasinski, Keanu Reeves and Kate McKinnon as an evil guinea pig.\u201cSuper-Pets\u201d has several summer vacation weeks left with little significant competition, and the hope is that it will continue to grow steadily thanks to positive feedback from audiences this weekend.\u201cThe interest is red hot,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cWord of mouth is exceptional.\u201dSecond place went to Universal\u2019s \u201cNope,\u201d which fell 57% from its debut last weekend and earned an additional $18.6 million. The North American grosses for \u201cNope\u201d are now sitting at $80.6 million before it begins its international expansion in August.\u201cThor: Love and Thunder\u201d took third place with $13.1 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its domestic total to $301.5 million. Its global total is now sitting at $662 million, without a release in China.\u201cMinions: The Rise of Gru\u201d stuck its heels in fourth place in its fifth weekend with $10.9 million. Worldwide, it has now earned $710.4 million.And rounding out the top five was \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d which made an additional $8.2 million in its 10th weekend, bringing its domestic total to $650.1 million.New theatrical releases were limited this weekend. Focus Features debuted the film \u201cVengeance\u201d in 998 locations this weekend, where it earned an estimated $1.8 million. B.J. Novak\u2019s directorial debut follows a podcaster (Novak) who travels from New York to west Texas to investigate the death of his girlfriend. The well-reviewed thriller features Issa Rae and Ashton Kutcher. And Bleecker Street opened the Sundance charmer \u201cA Love Song,\u201d starring Wes Studi and Dale Dickey, in four theaters, where it earned an estimated $18,702.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Trends ReporterOlivia Troye, a former Department of Homeland Security and counterterrorism adviser to former Vice President Mike Pence, said Friday there\u2019s a reason she \u201cwent very public\u201d about quitting her job in 2020 \u2015 and suggested current investigations into the missing Secret Service text messages involve the same person.Troye appeared on CNN as part of a panel alongside former CIA agent Phil Mudd and government ethics expert Norm Eisen when she made these claims. News anchor Jim Sciutto asked Troye why the missing messages, which are linked to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, weren\u2019t actively preserved.\u201cIt\u2019s a little surprising,\u201d said Troye. \u201cI have worked technical migrations in the government, and I find it a little bit confusing that people were not aware that these messages were going to disappear, especially with the amount of planning that goes into these migrations. I can tell you that firsthand having done it.\u201dWhile DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari\u2019s office planned to contact all Homeland Security agencies to assist in recovering the missing messages in February 2021, sources told The Washington Post it decided not to collect the phones or review any data later that month.\u201cI came from DHS,\u201d Troye told CNN. \u201cWhen you work at the senior levels in the Trump administration \u2026 you know exactly where people\u2019s loyalties lie. I know [Ken] Cuccinelli and Chad Wolf and all these people and Cuffari very well.\u201d (Cuccinelli and Wolf were the acting leaders at DHS at the time.)Cuffari notably waited more than one year to report that messages were missing to the House Jan. 6 committee. However, he first learned of the messages in May 2021 \u2014 seven months before alerting them, according to CNN.Troye, who famously quit the Trump administration in 2020 over its lacking COVID-19 pandemic response, then linked that experience to the DHS inspector general\u2019s office \u2015 which was led by Cuffari at the time.\u201cThere is a reason that I went very public with my concerns about the Trump administration, rather than going through the traditional whistleblower process, which would have led me through the inspector general\u2019s office at DHS,\u201d Troye said Friday on CNN.\u201cAnd I\u2019ll just say that. So, there\u2019s a level of trust there that you understand.\u201dAs for the missing messages, the texts were seemingly lost when the Secret Service switched devices and migrated to a new internal data system.A senior forensics analyst in Cuffari\u2019s office had already prepared to collect some of the relevant phones when one of the deputies who \u201creport to Cuffari\u2019s team\u201d emailed investigators on Feb. 18 and instructed them not to move forward, sources told The Washington Post.\u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you, being a Trump admin person, most of the administration communicated on encrypted signal apps, apps like Signal,\u201d said Troye. \u201cSo, a lot of the times, these messages were likely disappearing. So ... it\u2019s a little bit suspect.\u201dTroye went on to add: \u201cYou can either turn in your government phone \u2015 was there an encrypted app on it? Was it on their personal phone? In any case, it seems these messages are gone either way.\u201dMudd, a CNN counterterrorism analyst, called the handling of the situation \u201cbeyond incompetence.\u201d Mudd joined the CIA in 1985 as an analyst specializing in the Middle East and South Asia during President Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration.\u201cHow can the inspector general go to Congress now and say that you can trust me to conduct ongoing investigations when there are these gaps of reporting to you? I think the inspector general has to go,\u201d Mudd said.\u201cWhat the heck was the chief information officer at DHS doing?\u201d Mudd added. \u201cIf you\u2019re migrating data, the first question you have for someone who grew up with a manual typewriter is, is that data backed up? Not only because you are supposed to do that, but because the law says you have to do that.\u201dEisen, a CNN legal analyst, went even further in suggesting that the Justice Department is \u201cundoubtedly\u201d considering serious penalties for those potentially involved in the alleged negligence \u2014 or possible cover-up on behalf of the Trump administration.\u201cHow many coincidences are we going to have involving DHS and the Secret Service and these missing messages on the most crucial period of time that our nation has confronted in decades?\u201d Eisen asked.\u201cI mean, it just strains belief,\u201d he added. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to prejudge, but [the] DOJ is undoubtedly taking a hard look at some of the federal penalties that can include criminal penalties if we find that this was not an accident, that it was not negligence, that was not coincidence after coincidence \u2014 but something intentional was going on here.\u201dTrends Reporter\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPostThe Jan. 6, 2021, text messages of two Department of Homeland Security leaders during Donald Trump\u2019s final days as president are missing, The Washington Post reported, citing four unnamed sources and email records.The government phones of Chad Wolf, former acting DHS secretary, and Ken Cuccinelli, an acting deputy secretary, reportedly were \u201creset\u201d when they left the government in January 2021, wiping their texts.The DHS Office of Inspector General was notified of the missing texts in February, but failed to inform Congress and made no efforts to recover the records, the Post reported. This is not the first time Joseph Cuffari\u2019s office has been criticized for withholding information from congressional lawmakers. Cuffari reportedly knew that Secret Service agents deleted almost all text messages from Jan. 6, 2021, for months, but did not tell lawmakers until recently.The chair of the House Jan. 6 committee called the deletions \u201ctroubling.\u201d\u201cIt is extremely troubling that the issue of deleted text messages related to the January 6 attack on the Capitol is not limited to the Secret Service, but also includes Chad Wolf and Ken Cuccinelli, who were running DHS at the time,\u201d committee Chair Bennie Thompson (R-Miss.) told the Post in a statement.The missing texts could have helped the panel\u2019s efforts to piece together the events leading up to Jan. 6.\u201cIf the Inspector General had informed Congress, we may have been able to get better records from Senior administration officials regarding one of the most tragic days in our democracy\u2019s history,\u201d Thompson continued.Cuccinelli was interviewed by the committee in December. He was involved in Trump meetings related to efforts to overturn the election, according to CNN.The New York Times has reported that Trump instructed his lawyer Rudy Giuliani to call Cuccinelli and inquire about seizing voting machines. Cuccinelli reportedly told Giuliani that DHS did not have the authority do so.The committee has contacted Wolf, The Associated Press reported.The latest revelation of missing texts comes as the committee has been zeroing in on Trump\u2019s Cabinet. The panel reportedly interviewed Steve Mnuchin, Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, and Mick Mulvaney, a former White House chief of staff and special envoy to Northern Ireland who resigned following the insurrection.The committee also is negotiating with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for a closed-door interview that could happen as soon as this week, CNN reported.You can read the full Washington Post story here.Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostAs the Alabama Department of Corrections prepared to execute Joe Nathan James Jr. on Thursday night, against the wishes of his victim\u2019s family members, an agency official told a journalist that she would not be allowed to witness the killing because her skirt was too short.The journalist, AL.com\u2019s Ivana Hrynkiw, had worn the skirt to previous executions \u201cwithout incident,\u201d she wrote in a statement. Even after pulling the skirt down to her hips to make the hemline fall lower, she was still told it was \u201cnot appropriate,\u201d she wrote. Determined to do her job, Hrynkiw borrowed waterproof fisherman\u2019s wader pants from a photographer she had never met, stuffing the suspenders under her shirt to keep the pants from falling down.The Department of Corrections spokesperson determined this was a more professional outfit, but proceeded to take issue with Hrynkiw\u2019s open-toe high-heeled shoes, claiming they were \u201ctoo revealing.\u201d After changing into tennis shoes she had in her car, Hrynkiw was finally permitted to cover the execution. \u201cThis was an uncomfortable situation, and I felt embarrassed to have my body and my clothes questioned in front of a room of people I mostly had never met,\u201d Hrynkiw wrote. I sat down, tried to stop blushing, and did my work. As women often have to do.\u201dAnother reporter who was present, Lee Hedgepeth, of the local CBS affiliate, confirmed on Thursday that the department told a reporter her skirt was too short to witness the execution, prompting her to borrow pants from a colleague.The Alabama Department of Corrections did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Media witnesses serve a vital role in bringing a modicum of transparency to executions, which are shrouded in secrecy. Corrections departments typically keep secret the identities of the executioners and the source of the drugs used \u2014 which are sometimes purchased in cash to avoid a paper trail. The few media witnesses allowed in the room bear witness to state-sponsored killings, alerting the public to unusual delays, breakdowns in protocol and signs of pain \u2014 although autopsies of individuals who have been executed suggest that even those who appear to have died peacefully may have experienced torturously painful deaths. Observations from media witnesses have been used in federal litigation challenging the constitutionality of execution protocols.Corrections departments heavily restrict media access to executions, typically allowing only a small number of pre-selected journalists in the room. They are often only let in the room after the individual being killed has been strapped down to the gurney, sometimes with an obstructed view of the killing. Witnessing executions is a traumatic experience, and the journalists who do it describe feeling incredible pressure to accurately capture details while watching someone be killed.On Thursday, Hrynkiw had to do that difficult work, wearing ill-fitting clothes loaned to her by a stranger, while a government official policed her appearance in front of her colleagues.Because of Hrynkiw and the other witnesses to James\u2019 execution, we know the killing was delayed by more than three hours and that the Alabama Department of Corrections has refused to explain why. On Friday, after multiple inquiries from reporters, the agency put out a vague statement suggesting there was an issue setting the intravenous lines.The state killed James by lethal injection as punishment for killing his ex-girlfriend Faith Hall in 1994. Earlier this month, Hall\u2019s daughter and several family members asked Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey (R) to stay the execution. Ivey denied the request and James was pronounced dead at 9:27 p.m. on Thursday.\u201cJustice has been served,\u201d Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall claimed after the killing.But Hall\u2019s family members, who declined to attend the execution, didn\u2019t see it that way. \u201cWe hoped the state wouldn\u2019t take a life simply because a life was taken and we have forgiven Mr. Joe Nathan James Jr. for his atrocities toward our family,\u201d they said in a statement.

To commemorate the release, the music superstar has shared an open letter on her website to fans, which contains a never-before-seen photo of her three children with her husband Jay-Z.In the adorable selfie, Beyonce cuddles in bed with Blue, 10, Rumi, 5, and Sir, 5, who are all fast asleep.\u201cI want to give a special thank you to Rumi, Sir and Blue for allowing me the space, creativity, and inspiration,\u201d she wrote in the message. \u201cAnd a special thanks to my husband and muse, who held me down during those late nights in the studio.\u201dThe singer explained that she worked on the \u201cthree-act project\u201d for three years. Forever keeping us on our toes, Beyonc\u00e9 has yet to reveal exactly what the other two acts will contain. \u201cCreating this album allowed me a place to dream and find escape during a scary time for the world,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTo feel free and adventurous in a time when little else was moving. My intention was to create a safe place, a place without judgment. A place to be free of perfectionism and overthinking. A place to scream, release and feel freedom.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Environment Reporter, HuffPostThe climate and clean energy provisions in the surprise reconciliation package Democrats announced late Thursday are far smaller than the $555 billion in climate spending eyed in the initial \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan that President Joe Biden unveiled last year.Still, at a whopping $369 billion, it would be the most significant investment the U.S. has ever made to confront fossil fuel-driven climate breakdown and its mounting impacts. \u201cThis will be, by far, the biggest climate action in human history,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said in a statement shortly after Democrats struck the deal. \u201cThe planet is on fire. Emissions reductions are the main thing. This is enormous progress. Let\u2019s get it done.\u201dSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said it will be \u201cthe greatest pro-climate legislation that has ever been passed by Congress.\u201d And in Thursday remarks at the White House, Biden called it \u201cthe most significant legislation in history to tackle the climate crisis and improve our energy security right away.\u201dThe new agreement, now dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act and which is expected to come up for a vote as early as next week, would set the U.S. on course to slash its greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030, according to the one-page summary of the bill. The package comes on the heels of an analysis that found without additional policy actions, the U.S. is on pace to reduce planet-warming emissions 24% to 35% below 2005 levels by the end of the decade \u2014 far short of Biden\u2019s 50% to 52% goal. The bill includes more than 100 climate and energy provisions. The bulk of the spending comes in the form of clean energy tax credits, grants and loans. It provides $30 billion in incentives for companies to manufacture solar panels, wind turbines and batteries, as well as to process critical minerals. There\u2019s another $10 billion in tax credits for the construction of new clean technology manufacturing facilities, up to $20 billion in loans to build clean vehicle manufacturing plants, and $500 million in Defense Production Act funds for heat pumps and critical minerals processing. The package would lower the cost of electric vehicles for low- and middle-income Americans, with $7,500 tax credits for new EVs and $4,500 for used ones, and invest billions to electrify low-income households. Additionally, the bill earmarks $60 billion to confront legacy pollution and invest in low-income and communities of color; $27 billion for a so-called \u201cgreen bank\u201d to boost clean energy and slash emissions, with a particular focus on disadvantaged communities; $20 billion for climate-friendly agriculture; and $5 billion in forest conservation grants. It would also establish a fee on emissions of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas that is released from a number of sources, including oil and gas operations. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) shocked Democrats and Republicans alike on Thursday when he gave his blessing to the scaled-down, $740 billion spending package, which will raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy to pay for investments in both climate and health care. The decision came just two weeks after Manchin, who has proven himself a relentless thorn in Democrats\u2019 side, seemingly torpedoed what was widely seen as a last chance for the party to pass meaningful climate legislation. In a lengthy statement Thursday and a subsequent interview Friday with West Virginia radio host Hoppy Kercheval, Manchin made it clear that his support hinged on support for fossil fuels.\u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 invests in the technologies needed for all fuel types \u2015 from hydrogen, nuclear, renewables, fossil fuels and energy storage \u2015 to be produced and used in the cleanest way possible,\u201d he said in his statement. \u201cIt is truly all of the above, which means this bill does not arbitrarily shut off our abundant fossil fuels.\u201d Among other things, the bill would reinstate oil and gas leases that companies obtained during a November 2021 auction and which a federal judge later vacated after concluding that the Biden administration had failed to properly account for the climate impacts of the lease sale. It also ties future renewable energy projects on federal lands to ongoing oil and gas development, requiring the Interior Department to offer at auction at least 2 million acres onshore and 60 million acres offshore to oil and gas interests before it can proceed with wind, solar and other renewable lease sales.Manchin also said he received a commitment from Biden, Leader Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to reform the federal permitting process for energy infrastructure, including pipelines. \u201cI\u2019m saying straight to you, without permitting reforms, without the ability for America to do what it does best \u2014 produce \u2014 there is no bill,\u201d Manchin told Kercheval on Friday. \u201cThat is totally agreed upon and understood.\u201dEven with those fossil fuel concessions, climate advocates and environmental groups largely celebrated the package.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Social Justice ReporterThe sheriff\u2019s department in Houston released body camera footage last weekend that shows a deputy holding down a Black man and fatally shooting him at close range after receiving 911 calls about an alleged shoplifting and assault at a Dollar General store.Sgt. Garrett Hardin of the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office pinned Roderick Brooks to the ground on July 8 after a foot chase and shot him, the video shows. Sadiyah Evangelista Karriem, an attorney for Brooks\u2019 family, told HuffPost that the deputy shot the 47-year-old near where his head and neck met.Brooks\u2019 family has alleged police brutality and misuse of force, and on Tuesday called for the Texas Rangers and U.S. Department of Justice to investigate the shooting.They believe the law enforcement footage tells only part of the story. Demetria Brooks-Glaze, Brooks\u2019 sister, said witnesses told the family that the officer hit Brooks several times and that it was not shown in body camera footage released by the department.\u201cThe world needs to see what they are doing. In this case, they are not showing everything,\u201d she said, calling the shooting a \u201cracist act.\u201d\u201cWhat gives you the right to take someone\u2019s life by shooting them in the back of the head and neck?\u201d Brooks-Glaze added.Law enforcement said security video, which has not been released to the public, shows Brooks arriving at the Dollar General and then leaving without paying for items he grabbed from the shelves. A female employee confronted him at the exit, according to police. At 6:04 p.m., the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office received a call from a woman who said a \u201cBlack man in a blue shirt, gray shorts and baseball cap\u201d had taken items from the store without paying and hit her. \u201cA customer is running out of the store and he hit me on the way out,\u201d the woman said during the 911 call, a recording of which has been released by the police. \u201cHe pushed my arm out of the way.\u201d The woman said she did not need emergency medical services.\u201cI just want him to get arrested because he is literally running to the back of the building right now,\u201d she told the dispatcher. The woman later told the dispatcher that she didn\u2019t believe the man had a weapon, and she did not think he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The dispatcher asked if the deputies would face any threats once they arrived on the scene, and the woman said no. One man called 911 twice, saying had seen a man leave the store with detergent and alleging the man had \u201cpushed a lady down\u201d on his way out.Footage released by the police shows Hardin approaching Brooks in his car and stopping in front of a gas station. \u201cCome here, dude,\u201d the officer says as he leaves his vehicle. He then chases Brooks through the parking lot. \u201cStop, dude, I\u2019m going to tase you!\u201d Hardin says. He tells Brooks to get on the ground several times.The officer then stuns Brooks, taking him to the ground. The footage goes dark briefly. When it returns, Brooks is on the ground and the officer has his hand on his neck. The stun gun is on the ground, close to Brooks\u2019 head. \u201cWhy did you tase me?\u201d Brooks asks Hardin. \u201cPlease get off me, man.\u201d The two begin to struggle. While pinned to the ground, Brooks grabs the Taser in front of him.\u201cI\u2019m going to shoot you. Put that down,\u201d Hardin says. \u201cI will fucking shoot you.\u201dThe body camera footage shows that Brooks did not point the Taser toward the officer, and that he let go of it while Hardin reached for his gun. Hardin then shot Brooks in the base of his head and neck while holding him to the ground.Attorneys representing Brooks\u2019 family are also working to file a lawsuit against Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office and Hardin.\u201cThis is what we see when we continuously have a lack of honest policing in this country. It is a failure from top to bottom,\u201d Justin Moore, an attorney representing Brooks\u2019 family, told HuffPost. \u201cRoderick should be alive today if it wasn\u2019t for the rogue officer to be out here in these streets.\u201d \u201cWhat we saw on raw footage shows the officer was fully out of control and failed to follow policy,\u201d Moore added.Moore said Brooks never posed a threat to the deputy, even after the officer lost possession of his Taser during the struggle. \u201cThe Taser issue is a red herring, and if you see the video, he grabs the Taser but he releases it multiple times,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHe never grabs it and points it at the officer. He tried to get it to stop electrocuting him.\u201d Hardin is on paid administrative leave while the department investigates the shooting.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostDemocratic legislation that would protect the right to birth control and other contraceptives was blocked by Senate Republicans on Wednesday, a little more than a month after the Supreme Court reversed nearly 50 years of precedent and overturned abortion rights. Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) objected to a request to pass the bill via unanimous consent. If any senator opposes such a request on the Senate floor, it is rejected.Ernst claimed the Democrats\u2019 bill \u201cpurposefully goes far beyond the scope of contraception\u201d and said it could fund abortion providers and protect abortion-inducing drugs.The House passed the Right to Contraception Act last week amid fears that the high court may come for reproductive health care next. Democrats pointed to an opinion from Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas suggesting the court should reexamine precedent that guaranteed the right to contraception. The legislation would create a statutory right for people to obtain and use contraceptives, as well as codifying protections for physicians who provide them. In the House, 195 Republicans opposed the measure.Ernst on Wednesday sought to pass her own bill that would expedite over-the-counter access to birth control. Democrats objected, saying it wouldn\u2019t prevent states from restricting or even banning access to birth control.\u201cHer bill would not ensure access to birth control, and it fails to codify the constitutional right to birth control across the United States,\u201d Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) said.The right to buy and use contraceptives is currently protected by the 1965 landmark Supreme Court decision in Griswold v. Connecticut. But Republicans who downplayed the threat to the 1973 abortion decision before the Supreme Court struck it down are similarly dismissing the threat to other rights, like contraception and same-sex marriage. Some state legislatures have introduced bills to restrict access to contraceptives, though they have not passed.It\u2019s unclear whether the bill protecting contraception will get a vote on the Senate floor amid the busy calendar, with many other competing priorities on the Democrats\u2019 agenda. A bill protecting same-sex marriages has picked up steam in the Senate with several GOP endorsements, but it doesn\u2019t yet have enough GOP votes to break a filibuster, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.).Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

He was ultimately given a stern warning before having his passport returned: \u201cYou better.\u201dIn his conversation with Fallon, Quinn expounded further on the beauty of the \u201cStranger Things\u201d fandom. He said he was moved by how strongly fans at Comic-Con identify with his character.\u201cI think it\u2019s probably the fact that he\u2019s an outsider, a little bit kind of on the fringes of society,\u201d said Quinn. \u201cIt\u2019s so moving to see how much he means to people.\u201dQuinn read one of Munson\u2019s monologues, switching accents from Scotland, Liverpool, Australia, New York City and Wales from one line to the next.Fallon reminded Quinn that his rendition of Metallica\u2019s \u201cMaster of Puppets\u201d during a vital \u201cStranger Things\u201d scene landed the song on the Billboard charts for the first time in decades. Quinn joked that he didn\u2019t share any royalties, but did get a shoutout from his acting idol Jack Black.Jack Black is an Eddie Munson stan, and that's how I know all is good in this world.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A judge in Atlanta has rejected an appeal by a group of voters and affirmed the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s decision that U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is eligible to run for reelection.The five voters from Greene\u2019s district sought to have her removed from the ballot, saying that she played a significant role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress\u2019 certification of Biden\u2019s presidential victory. That was a violation of a rarely invoked provision in the 14th Amendment against insurrection or rebellion, they argued.Represented by Free Speech for People, a national election and campaign finance reform group, the voters filed a complaint with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in March.Greene was questioned extensively during a daylong hearing in April before Georgia Administrative Law Judge Charles Beaudrot, who ruled on May 6 that Greene should not be disqualified. Raffensperger immediately affirmed the decision.The voters appealed in Fulton County Superior Court, where Chief Judge Christopher Brasher affirmed Raffensperger\u2019s adoption on Monday.The voters said Beaudrot made four legal errors, but Brasher found that Beaudrot acted properly.Free Speech for People said in a statement that Brasher ruled \u201cwith minimal legal analysis,\u201d and that it has not decided whether to appeal to the Georgia Supreme Court.The challenge to Greene\u2019s eligibility was based on a section of the 14th Amendment that says no one can serve in Congress \u201cwho, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress ... to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.\u201dRatified shortly after the Civil War, it was meant in part to keep representatives who had fought for the Confederacy from returning to Congress.Beaudrot found that the voters hadn\u2019t produced sufficient evidence that Greene\u2019s actions before, during and after the Capitol siege encouraged and helped facilitate a violent attack on the U.S. government and democracy in violation of the U.S. Constitution.Greene won about 70% of the vote in the May Republican primary, easily defeating five challengers who tried to unseat her. She faces Democrat Marcus Flowers in November\u2019s general election.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Former Trump campaign adviser Steve Cortes vowed on the podcast that Trump\u2019s \u201cnext\u201d term would be \u201cfar more consequential\u201d than his last one.

He was 83.His publicist Roger Neal said he died Monday morning of natural causes at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. Sorvino had dealt with health issues over the past few years.\u201cOur hearts are broken, there will never be another Paul Sorvino, he was the love of my life, and one of the greatest performers to ever grace the screen and stage,\u201d his wife, Dee Dee Sorvino, said in a statement. She was by his side when he died.In his over 50 years in the entertainment business, Sorvino was a mainstay in films and television, playing an Italian American communist in Warren Beatty\u2019s \u201cReds,\u201d Henry Kissinger in Oliver Stone\u2019s \u201cNixon\u201d and mob boss Eddie Valentine in \u201cThe Rocketeer.\u201d He would often say that while he might be best known for playing gangsters, his real passions were poetry, painting and opera.Born in Brooklyn in 1939 to a mother who taught piano and father who was a foreman in a robe factory, Sorvino was musically inclined from a young age and attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in New York where he fell for the theater. He made his Broadway debut in 1964 in \u201cBajour\u201d and his film debut in Carl Reiner\u2019s \u201cWhere\u2019s Poppa?\u201d in 1970.With his 6-foot-4-inch stature, Sorvino made an impactful presence no matter the medium. In the 1970s, he acted alongside Al Pacino in \u201cThe Panic in Needle Park\u201d and with James Caan in \u201cThe Gambler,\u201d reteamed with Reiner in \u201cOh, God!\u201d and was among the ensemble in William Friedkin\u2019s bank robbery comedy \u201cThe Brink\u2019s Job.\u201d In John G. Avildsen\u2019s \u201cRocky\u201d follow-up \u201cSlow Dancing in the Big City,\u201d Sorvino got to play a romantic lead and use his dance training opposite professional ballerina Anne Ditchburn.He was especially prolific in the 1990s, kicking off the decade playing Lips in Beatty\u2019s \u201cDick Tracy\u201d and Paul Cicero in Martin Scorsese\u2019s \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d who was based on the real-life mobster Paul Vario, and 31 episodes on Dick Wolf\u2019s \u201cLaw & Order.\u201dHe followed those with roles in \u201cThe Rocketeer,\u201d \u201cThe Firm,\u201d \u201cNixon,\u201d which got him a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination, and Baz Luhrmann\u2019s \u201cRomeo + Juliet\u201d as Juliet\u2019s father, Fulgencio Capulet.Beatty would turn to Sorvino often, enlisting him again for his political satire \u201cBulworth,\u201d which came out in 1998, and his 2016 Hollywood love letter \u201cRules Don\u2019t Apply.\u201d He also appeared in James Gray\u2019s \u201cThe Immigrant.\u201dSorvino had three children from his first marriage, including Academy Award-winning actor Mira Sorvino. He also directed and starred in a film written by his daughter Amanda Sorvino and featuring his son Michael Sorvino.When he learned that Mira Sorvino had been among the women allegedly sexually harassed and blacklisted by Harvey Weinstein in the midst of the #MeToo reckoning, he told TMZ that if he had known, Weinstein, \u201cWould not be walking. He\u2019d be in a wheelchair.\u201dHe was proud of his daughter and cried when she won the best supporting actress Oscar for \u201cMighty Aphrodite\u201d in 1996. He the Los Angeles Times that night that he didn\u2019t have the words to express how he felt.\u201cThey don\u2019t exist in any language that I\u2019ve ever heard \u2014 well, maybe Italian,\u201d he said.But he wanted to be seen for more than what he was on screen and took particular pride in his singing. In 1996, \u201cPaul Sorvino: An Evening of Song\u201d was broadcast on television as a part of a PBS fundraising campaign. Songs performed included \u201cTorna A Sorriento,\u201d \u201cGuaglione,\u201d \u201cO Sole Mio,\u201d \u201cThe Impossible Dream\u201d and \u201cMama.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a pop singer in the sense Mario Lanza was,\u201d Sorvino said in an interview the Tampa Tribune. \u201cIt astonishes me that no American male singer sings with a full voice anymore. Where have all the tenors gone?\u201dThe weight of his voice, he thought, made it difficult to train.\u201cIt\u2019s like trying to park a bus in a VW parking space,\u201d he said.He also ran a horse rescue in Pennsylvania, had a grocery store pasta sauce line based on his mother\u2019s recipe, and sculpted a bronze statue of the late playwright Jason Miller that resides in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Sorvino had starred in Miller\u2019s Tony and Pulitzer-winning play \u201cThat Championship Season\u201d on Broadway in 1972 and its film adaptation.In 2014, he married political pundit Dee Dee Benkie and said that a goal of his later life was to \u201cdisabuse people of the notion that I\u2019m a slow-moving, heavy-lidded thug.\u201dAs with most who starred in \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d the image would follow him for the rest of his life which he had complex feelings about.\u2019Most people think I\u2019m either a gangster or a cop or something,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is I\u2019m a sculptor, a painter, a best-selling author, many, many things \u2014 a poet, an opera singer, but none of them is gangster....

It is believed responsible for the vast majority of coronavirus cases in the country. He has been isolating in the White House residence since then.Administration officials have emphasized that his symptoms are mild because he has received four vaccine doses, and he started taking the antiviral drug Paxlovid after becoming infected.The White House has not released any photos or video of Biden since Friday, when the media watched him participate in a virtual meeting with economic advisers.Jha pledged that the White House would keep giving updates on the president\u2019s condition and whether he might have long-term symptoms.\u201cWe think it\u2019s really important for the American people to know how well their president is doing,\u201d he said.\u201cObviously if he has persistent symptoms, obviously if any of them interfere with his ability to carry out his duties, we will disclose that early and often with the American people.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Politics Reporter, HuffPostPHOENIX \u2014 It was a sweltering Arizona evening in late June, and Kari Lake was standing on a stage in a church community center in front of a giant poster of Kari Lake. The promotional material for Lake\u2019s campaign for governor featured Lake\u2019s head and shoulders, floating alongside Donald Trump\u2019s head and shoulders, with a quote from Trump: \u201cKari Lake is fantastic. She is going to win big.\u201dTrump\u2019s endorsee was about to be interviewed by a reporter for a Japanese TV station in Gold Canyon, an upscale Phoenix suburb at the base of a mountain. Lake\u2019s own video team hovered in the background, capturing her every move. It was a million degrees and Lake was dry as a cactus. It wasn\u2019t long into the interview that Lake turned to two of her favorite subjects: Trump and the media.\u201cPeople of this country love Donald Trump,\u201d Lake said. \u201cIt\u2019s the corrupt, rotten media that\u2019s been trying to tell them and brainwash them into believing that people don\u2019t like him.\u201dLake\u2019s remarks about a \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201crotten\u201d media are especially breathtaking considering the source: a former newscaster who, less than two years ago, was still delivering the news in one of the nation\u2019s largest media markets. \u201cI want you to know if the Arizona \u2018Repugnant,\u2019 as I\u2019ve taken to calling it\u201d \u2014 Lake\u2019s derisive nickname for the Arizona Republic newspaper \u2014 \u201cif CNN and MSNBC are attacking people, those are the people you want to vote for,\u201d Lake told the crowd at a candidate forum just prior to her interview with the Japanese station.How Lake came to leave the media \u2014 or at least the story she tells about why she left the media \u2014 is the foundational story of her outsider campaign for governor. It also mirrors the trajectory of the far right\u2019s accelerating break with reality during the COVID pandemic and in the aftermath of the 2020 election, a rupture driven by actual fake news and propaganda.Lake, whose previous job involved discerning fact from fiction, is now closely aligned with the cowboy-hat-sporting state lawmaker Mark Finchem, a Trump-backed promoter of election falsehoods running for the role of chief elections officer. Together they help form the ranks of candidates who claim the 2020 election was \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cstolen,\u201d and both recently suggested, without credible evidence, that 2022\u2019s results may be compromised, too. Lake has also been endorsed by a slate of extremist figures tied to Trump, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn, U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar (Ariz.), MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, and Arizona state Sen. Wendy Rogers \u2014 the fringes of the fringe.Earlier this year, Lake was featured in promotional materials for the America First Political Action Conference, the extremist gathering organized by 23-year-old white nationalist Nick Fuentes. Lake responded that she was \u201cnot taking part\u201d in the event and called it a \u201cfalse photo.\u201d Fuentes\u2019 followers turned on Lake, but Fuentes defended her. \u201cThere was a scheduling mix-up with Kari Lake! Just a misunderstanding. Take it easy on her we support her,\u201d he posted on Telegram after the dust-up.There\u2019s at least one commonly agreed-upon reality in this race: Lake is resonating with the GOP base. With two weeks to go until the Aug. 2 primary, Lake has consistently led in polling of the GOP field. Although more recent polling suggests the race tightened after Doug Ducey, Arizona\u2019s moderate, term-limited Republican governor \u2014 who also leads the national fundraising campaign for GOP governors \u2014 endorsed her main rival, developer Karrin Taylor Robson, a move that fanned the flames of Ducey\u2019s proxy war with Trump. On Monday, former Vice President Mike Pence also threw his support behind the more establishment-friendly Taylor Robson.\u201cShe\u2019s a diva of her own persona \u2014 the television news personality who just doesn\u2019t believe the news.\u201dIf Lake wins the Republican nomination, she will likely face Democratic Secretary of State Katie Hobbs in a general election that Republicans are signaling they may use to relitigate, for the umpteenth time, the 2020 election results in a state that became known for its widely discredited election audit. In a debate this month, Lake pushed the stolen election narrative as a litmus test for the GOP field. In April, she and Finchem sued state and county officials to try and ban the use of electronic voting machines in this year\u2019s election. \u201cIt\u2019s election denier against election defender,\u201d said Chuck Coughlin, a veteran GOP strategist in Arizona, framing the hypothetical matchup between Lake and Hobbs.Lake, 52, is a charismatic, made-for-TV candidate entirely in Trump\u2019s mold \u2014 if Trump happened to be a woman with high cheekbones and a pixie haircut. Like Trump, Lake has spent decades on TV. Unlike the former president, Lake was primarily a local news anchor, spending a majority of her career at Fox\u2019s Phoenix station. Lake even interviewed Trump twice before following him down the golden escalator. Combative, hard-right MAGA warrior is a new look for Lake, and as a necessary feature of that image, Lake has turned against the reporters who were once her colleagues. \u201cIt\u2019s a vitriolic relationship with the media. She won\u2019t talk to anybody without it being on her terms,\u201d said Coughlin. \u201cShe\u2019s a diva of her own persona \u2014 the television news personality who just doesn\u2019t believe the news.\u201dLake\u2019s remarks about her former profession make you wonder how she stuck it out for as long as she did. Lake has called the media \u201ccriminal\u201d and said that some journalists \u201cprobably should be locked up.\u201d After leaving her job at Fox in March of last year, Lake launched her campaign for governor three months later by bashing a set of TVs and declaring, \u201cit\u2019s time to take a sledgehammer to the mainstream media\u2019s lies and propaganda.\u201dLake now likes to turn the tables on her former industry colleagues.Last month, Lake\u2019s video team captured and edited a clip of her declining an interview with a CNN reporter outside of an event. The clip went viral, and the reporter\u2019s face during the interaction became a meme on the right. Lake\u2019s campaign suggested to me a day earlier that Lake actually had plans to sit down with the network, but the campaign is known for baiting reporters, then packaging the resulting cringe into viral clips. Lake\u2019s ever-present video team is led by her husband, Jeff Halperin, who owns a video production company. Lake\u2019s teenage daughter is also paid to consult on her campaign, the Arizona Republic reported.HuffPost sent Lake a detailed request for fact-checking and comments for this piece, but Lake\u2019s campaign declined to provide answers to any specific questions: \u201cIt is very obvious that HuffPost is gearing up for a smear piece. Your line of questioning has zero truth behind it ... Dr. Evil\u2019s Washington Post tried the same type of smear. And it backfired. Do you leftist rags not realize that voters see this and laugh at you?\u201d\u201cWhy won\u2019t you write about Kari\u2019s policies? Her homeless policy? Her border policy? Her education policy?\u201d the response continued. \u201cYou exist solely as a Propaganda Mill for the Left and no one is buying your BS. Run your trash story, the people of Arizona know Kari Lake look [sic] forward to electing her Governor.\u201d In Arizona, Lake agreed to a 10-minute interview with HuffPost, on the implied condition that her campaign be allowed to record it, positioning us squarely in Lake\u2019s wheelhouse. Lake and I sat stiffly facing each other on a bench outside the church building in Gold Canyon. Asked if there was a specific moment when it became clear to her she could no longer be a journalist, Lake went back to the start of the pandemic.\u201cI\u2019ve always seen that modern-day journalism in America has really pushed to the left, obviously. But I felt that I was a voice of reason in the newsroom,\u201d Lake told me, at the same time that she seemed to be fishing for an opening to meme me.\u201cReally during COVID is when I went, \u2018What is going on here?\u2019 Things weren\u2019t making sense.\u201dWatching them now, Lake\u2019s two MAGA rally-adjacent interviews with Trump don\u2019t give any inkling of what was ahead \u2014 except when in early 2020 Trump seems to override his handlers to give Lake extra time to ask him questions (Lake also interviewed President Barack Obama in 2016).But at work and online, Lake was gaining a reputation for amplifying conspiracy theories that would touch on the election and the coronavirus. Lake was also promoting her presence on far-right social media sites, like the now-defunct Parler and Gab, a platform favored by anti-Semites.Lake\u2019s connection to a fact-based world became even more tenuous when she began running for office. She has since been linked to Ron Watkins, the rumored leader of the QAnon movement, which believes the nation\u2019s elites are running a secret child sex trafficking ring. The man alleged to be \u201cQ\u201d himself (Watkins has strongly denied being the voice behind Q\u2019s writings, but has admitted his general involvement in the QAnon movement) is also running for office as a Republican in Democrat Tom O\u2019Halleran\u2019s eastern Arizona congressional district. Watkins posted a photo on Telegram last year claiming he had dinner with Lake. Lake\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about her relationship with Watkins or Nick Fuentes.The events of recent years provide a striking contrast to how Lake describes her younger self to audiences. As a 24-year-old rising TV anchor, Lake drove her \u201cpacked, late-model used car\u201d from Iowa to Arizona to pursue a career in journalism, leaving behind a family with seven sisters and a brother. Lake told HuffPost she got into journalism because she \u201cloves telling people\u2019s stories. I like being in the middle of what\u2019s happening. And it really was a wonderful career for most of the time. But it just got to the point where it was becoming propaganda, and when I realized that I had to get out.\u201dScott Jones, a former TV news director who runs FTVLive, a gossip blog covering the cable news industry, said Lake was \u201ccertainly big and well-liked in Phoenix. And for a long time while she was doing the job, she was a real journalist. And then slowly this change happened, where she became infected with the radical right-wing disease.\u201d That change unfolded publicly over the latter half of Trump\u2019s presidency, according to people in Lake\u2019s personal and professional orbit who\u2019ve followed her career.In 2018, while Lake was still at Fox, she tweeted that a grassroots movement to raise teacher pay was actually cover for a ploy to legalize pot. Lake later deleted the tweet and apologized. Another time, Lake was caught on a hot mic ridiculing the Phoenix New Times, calling the city\u2019s spunky alt-weekly a \u201crag for selling marijuana\u201d after they reported on her joining Parler.\u201cLake was starting to make these statements, usually on Twitter or somewhere on social media. She would get in trouble and go off the air for a little while. Fox would never say if they suspended her or not,\u201d Jones said.\u201cThey\u2019re embarrassed by the mud she splashed on the station, and they\u2019re mad with management who let her continue to get away with it, especially late in her career.\u201dLake\u2019s station wouldn\u2019t elaborate on her tenure there, beyond confirming her final day of employment on March 1, 2021. Lake\u2019s campaign also wouldn\u2019t comment on her extended breaks or the specifics of her departure.While Lake was taking family medical leave from her job in early 2021, Jones reported that she was spotted at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Florida (which Lake attended this year as a featured speaker). Lake announced her resignation from Fox 10 not long after.Lake left the station with people \u201ccompletely embarrassed by her,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey\u2019re embarrassed by the mud she splashed on the station, and they\u2019re mad with management who let her continue to get away with it, especially late in her career.\u201dDiana Pike, a former HR director for Fox who was one of Lake\u2019s supervisors for 20 years, said Lake generally had good performance reviews and doesn\u2019t ever recall her being formally reprimanded. But Lake\u2019s wielding of social media to share her opinions eventually became a headache for her managers.\u201cThat\u2019s where 2018 and 2019 start to become real hot for her with regards to her posting information on Parler. We had to talk to her and say, \u2018You can\u2019t say this,\u2019 \u2018You can\u2019t say any of this stuff,\u2019\u201d said Pike, who retired from the station in 2019. Pike said Lake was told \u201cshe couldn\u2019t represent Fox with radical comments.\u201dAnother former station employee said Lake was \u201creally good\u201d in a supportive role with her former co-anchor. \u201cI don\u2019t have any ill will toward her or any negative feelings about her personally. All I can say is that I\u2019m perplexed, like a lot of people, why she turned into this mean girl. She\u2019s like a mean girl in middle school.\u201dLake\u2019s long career allowed her to enter politics with a recognizable name and brand, although a number of Republicans at GOP events questioned Lake\u2019s conservative credentials. Borrowing liberally from her personal reserves to fund her campaign, Taylor Robson has run several ads underscoring for voters that Lake was a registered Democrat from 2008 to 2012. Lake also gave money to Barack Obama and John Kerry under her married name, contributions she described to local media outlets as being on behalf of her family.But more were won over by Lake\u2019s disavowal of a corporate media industry that\u2019s viewed on the right with intense skepticism, if not outright scorn.\u201cI\u2019ve always liked Kari and I\u2019ve always liked what she has to say because she\u2019s articulate and she understands the business of the media.\u201d\u201cAll we want is the truth and we don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re getting the truth,\u201d said Gold Canyon GOP co-chairman Pam Burks, who was impressed with Lake and introduced her to the group as a \u201csymbol of truth in journalism.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always liked Kari and I\u2019ve always liked what she has to say because she\u2019s articulate and she understands the business of the media,\u201d said Kevin Brislawn, a retired 70-year-old who also heard from Finchem and Senate candidate Jim Lamon, an Alabama-born businessman, at the forum.\u201cCommunication is a gift of hers,\u201d another attendee said of Lake. \u201cI feel like she\u2019s going to speak the truth and not be so aggressive about it.\u201dWhile Lake throws bombs in her primary, Katie Hobbs, Arizona\u2019s Democratic secretary of state and the presumed front-runner for her party\u2019s nomination for governor, has been trying to steer clear of the wreckage.Hobbs is also someone you\u2019d recognize from TV. At the height of the circus surrounding the 2020 election and the GOP\u2019s partisan election audit, Hobbs was on the cable news circuit, providing commentary as Arizona\u2019s top election official, and blasting the partisan audit as a \u201cjoke.\u201dI met Hobbs last month for morning coffee in an artsy neighborhood on the outskirts of downtown Phoenix. Hobbs, 52, wears her hair in a silver-gray bob with cat-eye glasses. She was friendly but guarded. It was clear Hobbs understands how the race will be framed if she and Lake are opponents.\u201cI don\u2019t want to say overshadow, but the 2020 election is playing such a huge role in this race \u2014 and not just the election overall, but this race in particular,\u201d Hobbs said, adding that Lake is \u201cthe biggest cheerleader promoting Trump\u2019s lies about the election and my role defending all that.\u201dHobbs\u2019 role \u201cdefending all that\u201d has become an all-consuming aspect of the job the former social worker has held since 2019. \u201cThat\u2019s the situation I\u2019ve been in for a while,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not gonna back down from telling the truth of what happened \u2014 that our elections were conducted with integrity and according to the laws that are in place, that every voter can have confidence that the results are accurate, and there\u2019s literally no evidence to the contrary.\u201dDefending the election also means that Hobbs routinely faces violent threats, which began pouring in regularly after her criticism of the partisan audit. Hobbs usually travels with a private security detail paid for by Every Eligible American, a nonprofit. Against that backdrop, Hobbs paid extra close attention to a man who started scaling a parking structure in the middle of our interview. It was weird, but also not the kind of city occurrence you would necessarily bat an eye at unless you happened to be a frequent recipient of death threats. Hobbs looked rattled.\u201cI don\u2019t think about it,\u201d Hobbs said of the specific threats she\u2019s faced since the 2020 election, \u201cor else I would never leave my house.\u201dWhile Hobbs is well positioned for the Democratic nomination, her campaign has been dogged by a yearsold discrimination case brought by a former Black female staffer for state Senate Democrats, and the campaign\u2019s bungled response. As the Arizona Senate\u2019s top Democrat at the time, Hobbs apologized for the staffer\u2019s firing, but it has become a potent line of attack for Hobbs\u2019 primary opponent, former Nogales mayor Marco Lopez. Hobbs told HuffPost that she has taken \u201cresponsibility\u201d and \u201caccountability\u201d for her role in the firing.Even with a candidate that some consider flawed, Democrats have a better shot of winning the governorship against a polarizing Republican like Lake, who may have a tougher time pulling together a coalition of moderates and independents to win a general election in a diversifying state. The presumptive GOP front-runner has tried to strengthen her appeal with plans to tackle border security and homelessness.Lake has mastered messaging around \u201cthe media is bad, Trump was cheated out of the election, big brother\u2019s forcing us to wear a mask, as all that. That\u2019s her game. She talks it up better than anybody,\u201d said Tyler Montague, an Arizona-based GOP operative. \u201cBut she\u2019s a quarter-inch deep. She literally can\u2019t get off those topics, otherwise she\u2019s in trouble.\u201dCarolina Rodriguez-Greer, the Arizona director for Latino GOTV organization Mi Familia Vota, said people are sick of looking back to the 2020 election, when Joe Biden won the state by less than a percentage point, setting off all manner of election conspiracy.\u201cWe still have people that believe that the election results were not true, even though we\u2019ve already gone through two audits that have been paid for by the taxpayers,\u201d she said. \u201cThat narrative is extremely dangerous.\u201dProbably one of the more unexpected narratives to arise from the governor\u2019s race came last month, when Phoenix drag star Barbra Seville, aka Richard Stevens, released photos and private messages he exchanged with Lake over the course of their two-decade acquaintanceship. Stevens took issue with Lake tweeting, \u201cThey kicked God out of schools and welcomed the Drag Queens. They took down our Flag and replaced it with a rainbow.\u201d Lake has also echoed GOP hysteria over drag and \u201cgrooming\u201d children.According to Stevens, his former friend had once hired him to perform at a baby shower in drag, in front of children, a bomb meant to show Lake\u2019s hypocrisy on the issue. Stevens also performed for Lake once at her birthday and at \u201csome of the seediest bars in Phoenix,\u201d he wrote on Facebook.The story caused enough of a stir that Lake\u2019s campaign sent a cease-and-desist letter to Stevens warning him to stop making certain claims about Lake. Her campaign confirmed to The Washington Post that Stevens was \u201ca friend\u201d and that Lake once attended an event with \u201ca Marilyn Monroe impersonator.\u201d A campaign spokesperson told the newspaper that Stevens\u2019 Facebook post contained \u201cdefamatory lies\u201d and that Lake would pursue legal action.Lake and Stevens bonded over makeup and Madonna, Stevens said over the phone last month, sounding almost wistful about his onetime friend. He said Lake started coming to his shows in the late \u201990s and they struck up a casual friendship that lasted years. Lake\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to questions about her relationship with Stevens.\u201cI knew her as very level-headed. I found her to be middle-of-the-road liberal. She and I, we didn\u2019t have in-depth conversations about politics, but it wasn\u2019t uncommon to talk about news and current events because that\u2019s what we bonded over,\u201d he said.The idea that Lake isn\u2019t who she says she is has haunted her entry into politics. And it might be what undoes her campaign.\u201cI think Karrin Taylor Robson will be the best person to be a fresh new leader for the state of Arizona,\u201d Ducey, Arizona\u2019s governor, said last weekend on CNN, lending his political heft to Lake\u2019s rival. \u201cHer opponent, on the other hand, bears no resemblance \u2014 her campaign or even her personal interactions with me \u2014 to anything she\u2019s done over the past 30 years. This is all an act.\u201dDays later, Fox News uncovered a Facebook post from Lake where she called Trump \u201cnot my president\u201d just before his 2017 inauguration, raising the question of exactly when Lake became a full-throated Trump supporter. Fox reported the post disappeared from Lake\u2019s page once a reporter had reached out for comment.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine her as governor. She couldn\u2019t lead a newsroom of 100 people. She can\u2019t lead a state.\u201dPike, Lake\u2019s former supervisor, said Lake \u201cmakes it sound like she\u2019s everyman, and she\u2019s not everyman,\u201d adding that Lake was \u201cwell paid\u201d for working at the station, something Lake also acknowledges on the campaign trail when she discusses walking away from a \u201cvery large salary.\u201dA Republican and a Trump voter in 2016, Pike posted critically on Facebook about Lake\u2019s run for governor and several of her former Fox colleagues chimed in with similar comments. Taylor Robson\u2019s campaign found Pike and cast her in a campaign ad, in which Pike calls Lake an \u201cactress\u201d and a \u201cpretender.\u201dPike said she spoke out because many of her former colleagues are bound by nondisclosure agreements. \u201cI just don\u2019t see Kari as an ethical person, an adult,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine her as governor. She couldn\u2019t lead a newsroom of 100 people. She can\u2019t lead a state.\u201dAsked whether she\u2019s tried to bring up her concerns with how the news is being reported with her former colleagues, Lake said: \u201cNow, I don\u2019t really have a lot of relationships [with them] ... I\u2019m so busy.\u201dLake continued: \u201cEvery journalist pushes stories. They push an interesting topic they want to get covered. Obviously, those stories weren\u2019t being covered. So as a journalist, when you\u2019re pushing them and they\u2019re not being covered, you start to read the writing on the wall and you go, \u2018Wow, not an interest in these stories. Not an interest in the full truth.\u2019 And so I walked away.\u201dPolitics Reporter, HuffPost"}

Handler candidly spoke about when and why things started not working between the two, and how that led to their split, which she says happened about a month ago. \u201cMy love was so big that it just blew me open,\u201d Handler said, sounding like she was on the verge of tears, during an appearance on the podcast \u201cWe Can Do Hard Things with Glennon Doyle\u201d on Thursday.The former late night host made it sound like she was the one who ended things with Koy after experiencing issues for \u201csome time.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve been dealing with this behind the scenes for a while,\u201d Handler said, adding that the two were previously trying to work things out in therapy. \u201cI think that when you have the grounding and the courage to say that, you know, something isn\u2019t working, you\u2019re saying a lot more than that to the whole world,\u201d she said, still clearly emotional. \u201cAnd you\u2019re inviting in things that are going to be workable, and more suited to your needs and what you\u2019re available for.\u201d Doyle asked Handler when it was the time to \u201cstop digging\u201d in a relationship, and she provided a very honest answer. \u201cI think when it becomes untenable. And it becomes unhealthy,\u201d Handler said. \u201cIf you\u2019re arguing, you know, it\u2019s devolving. If you can\u2019t have conversations that are calm and loving, and constant, and you\u2019re not a team \u2015 not feeling like a team \u2015 then it becomes untenable.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to abandon myself,\u201d the comedian added. \u201cAnd if I have to choose one person, I have to choose myself.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nice to bend for people, it\u2019s nice to learn how to compromise. It\u2019s nice to learn how to demonstrate my love publicly. That\u2019s something I was never able to do for anybody, but I believe Jo needed that,\u201d Handler explained. \u201cI was so inspired by us ... but Jo didn\u2019t crack me open. My psychiatrist cracked me open, and then I was open.\u201d \u201cAnd then I was able to bend for somebody and move and compromise, and make them the biggest part of my life, but you can\u2019t change somebody intrinsically,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd, I was willing to do so much bending, but there\u2019s a line. And I\u2019m very proud of myself that I didn\u2019t let myself cross that line.\u201d Handler said that she\u2019s doing \u201cokay\u201d and feels \u201coptimistic about the future now.\u201d \u201cI still believe that my person is coming. Whether that is Jo Koy at a certain time or if it\u2019s not, like, I accept that,\u201d Handler said. Handler and Koy publicly announced that they were ending their relationship on Tuesday, and also posted a video they\u2019d made in anticipation of their upcoming one-year anniversary. \u201cIt is with a heavy heart to announce that we have decided together that it is best for us to take a break from our relationship right now,\u201d Handler said at the time, calling her ex \u201cone of the greatest gifts of my life.\u201dKoy, in a breakup post of his own, said he was Handler\u2019s \u201cbiggest fan\u201d and promised the two \u201cwill always remain great friends and will always have love for one another.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPostThe House passed the Right to Contraception Act on Thursday \u2015 a bill that codifies the right to birth control and other contraceptives amid fears that the Supreme Court may come for that aspect of reproductive health care next after the high court repealed Roe v. Wade\u2019s protection of abortion rights last month. The bill passed despite 195 Republicans who voted against the bill in a final vote of 228 to 195. Republicans who voted against the legislation included Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Paul Gosar (Ariz.), Jack Bergman (Mich.) and Joe Wilson (S.C.). Just eight Republicans voted in favor of the bill.The Senate recently introduced a companion measure that will likely see a vote sometime next week. Despite the flurry of action on reproductive rights in the House, all of the recently passed health care rights bills are likely doomed to die by filibuster in the Senate. The Right to Contraception Act, introduced by Rep. Kathy Manning (D-N.C.), codifies the right to birth control into federal law by creating a statutory right for people to obtain and use contraceptives, as well as codifying protections for physicians who provide contraceptives. The bill protects a range of contraceptives approved by the Food and Drug Administration and defines contraception as any \u201caction taken to prevent pregnancy, including the use of contraceptives or fertility-awareness based methods, and sterilization procedures.\u201d The bill authorizes the Department of Justice to take civil action against any federal or state official who attempts to restrict birth control access, and it allows those affected to also take civil action against anyone who attempts to enforce any restriction on contraception. \u201cIt is clear that their attempts to roll back the clock on contraception is again another plank on their extreme agenda for American women,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said at a Wednesday news conference before the vote.\u201cLet us be clear: We are not going back \u2015 for our daughters, for our granddaughters,\u201d Pelosi added.The legislation is a direct response to Justice Clarence Thomas, who wrote in a concurring opinion in the ruling that overturned Roe that the court should also reconsider the landmark 1965 decision in Griswold v. Connecticut, which protects the right to buy and use contraceptives without government interference.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Herschel Walker\u2019s Senate campaign in Georgia has been mired by scandal over just how many secret children he has fathered, allegations of domestic violence and multiple lies about his credentials. His own campaign reportedly described him as a \u201cpathological liar,\u201d but the race between the former NFL star and Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock isn\u2019t over yet \u2014 and Walker could win it all.Walker\u2019s candidacy should have been a long shot. After criticizing absent Black fathers, a racist trope, it was revealed that he has three secret children. He has repeatedly fumbled when discussing major policy issues, including climate change.\u201cSince we don\u2019t control the air, our good air decided to float over to China\u2019s bad air, so when China gets our good air, their bad air got to move,\u201d Walker said earlier this month while discussing the Green New Deal. \u201cSo it moves over to our good air space. Then, now, we got we to clean that back up.\u201dBut poll numbers show that this race isn\u2019t over yet.An AARP Georgia poll from this month saw the two candidates in a close race, with Warnock leading Walker 50% to 47%; a Data for Progress poll, also from this month, had Walker leading 49% to 47%. And even though a June Quinnipiac College poll showed Walker down by double digits, he was still doing well with the traditional Republican base: He led Warnock 52% to 45% among men, 62% to 35% with white voters, and 52% to 45% with those 65 or older. Part of the appeal is his status as a football hero. Walker played on the University of Georgia team that won the national championship in 1980, a feat the university didn\u2019t achieve again until 2021. Whenever Walker would make an appearance at the university\u2019s football stadium, he\u2019d receive a standing ovation. That championship is what many middle-aged Georgians remember \u2014 and love \u2014 about him. \u201cUniversity of Georgia football is very dominating in the state,\u201d Trey Hood, a political science professor at University of Georgia, told HuffPost. \u201cI don\u2019t want to denigrate religion, but it\u2019s really a quasi-religion down here.\u201d \u201cHis popularity is really incredible,\u201d he added.Republican political strategists agree that Walker\u2019s star power is a major plus.\u201cDemocrats are going to have a hard time in trying to demonize Herschel Walker like they did Kelly Loeffler,\u201d David Johnson, a strategist in Georgia, said in May, referring to a governor-appointed senator who failed to win her campaign last year. \u201cAnd the reason is in so many people\u2019s minds in Georgia, he\u2019s the great UGA strong. You\u2019re not going to be able to tarnish that.\u201dAnd of course, in a deeply polarized country, simply having the right letter next to your name will garner a decent amount of votes \u2014 especially going into the midterms, which historically work out in favor of the party that isn\u2019t in control of the White House. Georgia is a traditionally red state that went blue in 2020, but President Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating in the state is hovering around 30% now. \u201cThere are X number of people where it doesn\u2019t matter, they\u2019re just going to pull the R lever,\u201d Hood said.In June, voters at a campaign event brushed off news coverage of Walker\u2019s many scandals. \u201cHe is a man. He\u2019s doing right by his family. He\u2019s doing right by the community,\u201d Ronel Saintvil, a Black Republican voter, told The New York Times. \u201cTo me, for somebody just to bad mouth him like this, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s right. They\u2019re not focusing on the issues at hand that affect the people in Georgia. And I think that\u2019s what\u2019s more important.\u201dWalker also earned some Republican bona fides by defending President Donald Trump during the 2020 Republican National Convention and claiming he was not racist.\u201cIt hurt my soul to hear the terrible names that people call Donald,\u201d Walker said in a speech. \u201cI take that as a personal insult, that people would think I\u2019ve had a 37-year friendship with a racist.\u201d\u201cGrowing up in the Deep South, I\u2019ve seen racism up close. I know what it is. And it isn\u2019t Donald Trump,\u201d he said.After Trump lost the election, he propagated a lie that the election had been rigged, which culminated in an attack on the U.S. Capitol. Many Republicans showed their loyalty to the former president by embracing his lies and conspiracy theories, and Walker was no exception.In the weeks following the election, Walker called for a re-vote in some of the states won by Biden, made baseless claims about massive voter fraud, and promoted conspiracy theories about voting machines. In other words, he was the perfect Republican. Walker\u2019s scandals \u2014 incoherent statements, blatant hypocrisy, allegations of abuse \u2014 all seem eerily familiar. Trump\u2019s 2016 victory and his long-lasting influence in the GOP is partially due to the fact that voters embraced his style of politics. His status as a reality TV celebrity didn\u2019t hurt either. So while Walker\u2019s flaws are seen as a liability by Democrats, they may also be what sends him to Congress. \nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Bryant, who joined the show in 2012 alongside McKinnon, previously spoke about why she made the decision to step away, citing the uncertainty that COVID-19 brought to Studio 8H. \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for COVID, I probably would have left a few years earlier,\u201d Bryant told Variety last month. \u201cBut it was such a huge change. When COVID hit, it was so jarring that we were all like, \u2018I\u2019m definitely going to come back next year.\u2019 And then I had to shoot \u2018Shrill\u2019 for half of last season, and so I missed a lot.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 A federal appeals court on Wednesday overturned a lower court ruling and said Georgia\u2019s restrictive 2019 abortion law could take effect immediately. The decision wasn\u2019t surprising after the U.S. Supreme Court last month ruled that there is no constitutional right to an abortion.The Georgia law bans most abortions once a \u201cdetectable human heartbeat\u201d is present. Cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in cells within an embryo that will eventually become the heart as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women realize they\u2019re pregnant.The Georgia law includes exceptions for rape and incest, as long as a police report is filed. It also provides for later abortions when the mother\u2019s life is at risk or a serious medical condition renders a fetus unviable.A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a Mississippi case that overturned Roe v. Wade clears the way for the law to take effect, saying it \u201cmakes clear no right to abortion exists under the Constitution, so Georgia may prohibit them.\u201dThe appeals court also rejected arguments that a \u201cpersonhood\u201d provision in the law is unconstitutionally vague. The provision grants personhood to a fetus, giving it the same legal rights as people have after birth.Generally, the court\u2019s ruling wouldn\u2019t take effect for several weeks, until an official mandate was issued. But the court issued a second order Wednesday that allowed the law to take effect immediately.A federal judge put the law on hold before it could take effect and in July 2020 permanently blocked it, saying it was unconstitutional under the Supreme Court precedent that was recently overturned. The state appealed to the 11th Circuit, and a three-judge panel of the appeals court last fall said it would wait for the Supreme Court ruling in the Mississippi case before taking action on Georgia\u2019s appeal.The Supreme Court ruled on June 24 and Georgia\u2019s attorney general asked the appeals court that afternoon to overturn the lower court ruling and allow the state\u2019s abortion law to take effect.The 1973 decision of Roe v. Wade declared a fundamental right to an abortion prior to viability of the fetus. Planned Parenthood v. Casey narrowed that in 1992 to say states can\u2019t place an undue burden in the way of women seeking an abortion prior to viability.Georgia\u2019s so-called heartbeat law was one of a wave of laws passed by Republican-controlled legislatures in recent years to attack those rulings as anti-abortion activists and lawmakers saw an opportunity in a new conservative Supreme Court majority.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Environment Reporter, HuffPostPresident Joe Biden on Wednesday unveiled a series of new executive actions to confront the mounting effects of global climate change following another stalled legislative push from the president and Senate Democrats to secure billions of dollars in climate and clean energy investments. Biden detailed the unilateral effort during a visit to the shuttered Brayton Point coal-fired power plant in Somerset, Massachusetts. The facility is now being transformed into a manufacturing hub for submarine cables that will be used on offshore wind farms now being developed off the East Coast.Biden called planetary warming a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d and said he has \u201ca responsibility to act with urgency and resolve.\u201d\u201cLet me be clear: Climate change is an emergency,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the coming weeks, I\u2019m going to use the power I have as president to turn these words into formal, official government actions through the appropriate proclamations, executive orders and regulatory power that a president possesses.

But it falls far short of a national emergency declaration or the \u201cbeast mode\u201d executive action that progressive lawmakers and climate hawks have demanded in recent days.\u201cOur focus is on what we can do in light of where we find ourselves, between the urgency of action and the clarity of opportunity that\u2019s in front of us,\u201d a senior White House official said during a press call ahead of Biden\u2019s speech.The Interior Department for the first time will propose establishing a pair of offshore wind areas in the Gulf of Mexico encompassing some 700,000 acres off the coasts of Texas and Louisiana. Biden also directed the Interior Department to advance offshore wind off the mid- and southern Atlantic Coast, as well as and Florida\u2019s Gulf Coast. Biden also announced $2.3 billion in funding for FEMA\u2019s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program to help communities confront a myriad of climate impacts, from extreme heat and drought to flooding and wildfires. Those impacts have been on full display this week, as punishing heat and wildfires plague swaths of the U.S. and Europe. Finally, the Department of Health and Human Services will issue new guidance to help states leverage funding through the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) in order to build community cooling centers and purchase at-home air conditioners. Last week, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) ruled out any new climate spending in a scaled-down social spending package, seemingly upending months of negotiations on Capitol Hill. Manchin subsequently said he was still open to a bigger deal that includes climate funding and that he just wanted to see July\u2019s inflation numbers first. But public outrage had already ballooned. Climate and environmental advocates condemned the coal state Democrat for negotiating in bad faith and urged Biden to immediately use his executive powers, including declaring a national climate emergency, to curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.Reporting earlier this week from The Washington Post and other media outlets indicated Biden was considering, even likely, to sign an emergency declaration as soon as today. But by Tuesday, the White House had at least temporarily sidelined the idea.\u201cThe climate emergency is not going to happen tomorrow, but we still have it on the table,\u201d Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, said during a Tuesday briefing. \u201cI don\u2019t have a date circled in the calendar.\u201d In the 18 months since Biden took office, many climate activists, environmental groups and progressive Democrats have repeatedly called on the president to lean into his executive powers to confront the global threat, including halting new oil and gas leases on federal lands and blocking new pipelines and other fossil fuel projects.That pressure only grew after Manchin torpedoed the climate talks on Capitol Hill last week. Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.) and Jeff Merkley (Ore.) joined those calls, urging Biden to use the Defense Production Act to boost clean energy technologies.\u201cThe potential to enact the legislation is dead,\u201d Merkley told reporters previously. \u201cThis then frees up the president to use the full powers of the executive branch. And those full powers certainly include a climate emergency.\u201dThe White House has signaled that Biden plans to take additional executive action on climate in the coming days and weeks. Biden\u2019s speech and the administration\u2019s announcements Wednesday received mixed reviews from climate and environmental advocates. Many welcomed the executive actions but called on Biden to go further to rein in planet-warming fossil fuels. \u201cWe appreciate that Biden feels like the climate crisis is an emergency, but now is the time for him to act like it,\u201d JL Andrepont, a senior policy campaigner at environmental group 350.org, said in a statement. \u201cThe planet is burning; droughts, heatwaves, and wildfires are contributing to famine and death on almost every continent, while Biden waits to officially declare a Climate Emergency, and waits to use all of the powers at his disposal to comprehensively address the climate crisis.\u201d\u201cWhat is needed right now is not more words, but action,\u201d Andrepont said.Environment Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "National Reporter, HuffPostThe U.S. Secret Service on Tuesday failed to provide missing text messages to the House committee investigating the violent Jan. 6 insurrection, amid deepening scrutiny of deleted messages agents exchanged both that day and the day prior.The development, first reported by the Washington Post, came in tandem with a call from the National Archives for an investigation into the deleted texts.In a letter to the Department of Homeland Security Tuesday, the U.S. Government\u2019s chief records officer Laurence Brewer instructed the Secret Service to investigate the matter and determine if any text messages have been improperly deleted.The Secret Service must now provide a report to the National Archives and Records Administration within 30 days, including a description of the records, an accounting of the exact circumstances surrounding their deletion, details of actions taken to salvage the records and what safeguards have been established to prevent further loss.Brewer emphasized that any unauthorized deletion represents a serious matter, regardless of whether or not the texts themselves are relevant to the Congressional committee investigating the events of Jan. 6.The Secret Service says the messages were erased as part of a routine and pre-planned device-replacement program, but the timeline of the deletions has raised eyebrows. DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari told the House committee investigating Jan. 6 that the texts were deleted after his office requested the records as part of a probe into the events, though the Secret Service denies this.The committee subpoenaed the Secret Service last Friday demanding the agency\u2019s texts and records from that day. Committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) told ABC that the panel hoped to get at least some of the pertinent texts by Tuesday, ahead of their next public Jan. 6 hearing, scheduled for 8 p.m. ET Thursday.The records have taken on additional importance following the bombshell testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson. Among other revelations, the aide to Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told House investigators that Trump \u201clunged\u201d for the steering wheel of the presidential limo on Jan. 6 in an effort to be taken to the Capitol.While the Secret Service said it planned to dispute her testimony, the agency has yet to formally do so nearly three weeks later.Committee members also surely want to see Secret Service communications regarding the effort to keep various politicians safe that day, not the least of whom is former vice president Mike Pence, who was forced into hiding as a mob screaming \u201chang Mike Pence\u201d forced their way into the building.National Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Jury selection began Monday in the trial of Steve Bannon, a one-time top adviser to former President Donald Trump. He is facing criminal contempt of Congress charges after refusing for months to cooperate with the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.Bannon is charged in Washington\u2019s federal court with defying a subpoena from the Jan. 6 committee that sought his records and testimony. He was indicted in November on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress, one month after the Justice Department received a congressional referral. Each count carries a minimum of 30 days of jail and as long as a year behind bars.By early afternoon, eight jurors had been seated in a slow-moving process known as voir dire. Much of the questioning of potential jurors by Bannon\u2019s lawyer, Evan Corcoran, centered on how much of the Jan. 6 hearings they\u2019ve watched and whether they have opinions about the committee and its work.In one case, a prospective juror flatly told U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols that remaining impartial would be \u201ca challenge\u201d for him since, \u201cI do believe (Bannon) is guilty.\u201dThat admission, in addition to disqualifying the potential juror, prompted questioning of others who had sat next to the man to determine how widely he had shared his opinion.The trial follows a flurry of activity in the case since July 9. Over a week ago, the former White House strategist notified the committee that he is now willing to testify. His former lawyer, Robert Costello, said the change was because Trump had waived his executive privilege claim from preventing the testimony.Bannon, 68, had been one of the most prominent of the Trump-allied holdouts in refusing to testify before the committee. He had argued that his testimony was protected by Trump\u2019s claim of executive privilege, which allows presidents to withhold confidential information from the courts and the executive branch.Trump has repeatedly asserted executive privilege \u2014 even though he\u2019s a former, not current president \u2014 to try to block witness testimony and the release of White House documents. The Supreme Court in January ruled against Trump\u2019s efforts to stop the National Archives from cooperating with the committee after a lower court judge \u2014 Ketanji Brown Jackson, now on the Supreme Court \u2014 noted, in part, \u201cPresidents are not kings.\u201dThe committee has also noted that Trump fired Bannon from the White House in 2017 and Bannon was thus a private citizen when he was consulting with the president in the run-up to the riot.Judge Nichols declined motions to delay the contempt trial in separate hearings last week, including Thursday when Bannon\u2019s lawyers raised concerns about a CNN report that has since aired about their client and what they said were prejudicial comments made during a hearing last week held by the House committee.\u201cI am cognizant of current concerns about publicity and bias and whether we can seat a jury that is going to be appropriate and fair, but as I said before, I believe the appropriate course is to go through the voir dire process,\u201d Nichols said Thursday. The judge said he intended to get a jury that \u201cis going to be appropriate, fair and unbiased.\u201cWhile the judge allowed the trial to move forward, Nichols left open the possibility that the letters about Trump waiving his privilege and Bannon\u2019s offer to cooperate with the committee could be referenced at trial, saying the information was \u201cat least potentially relevant\u201d to Bannon\u2019s defense.Roscoe Howard Jr., the former U.S. attorney in Washington, said the best case for Bannon is if the information on his cooperation offer gets to the jury. Even if it does, however, a claim that executive privilege stopped him from cooperating earlier will be a hard argument to make because Bannon refused to answer the subpoena, Howard said.\u201cYou have to show up to invoke the privilege claim. You can\u2019t phone it in,\u201d he said.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "GREENWOOD, Ind. (AP) \u2014 Three people were fatally shot and two were injured Sunday evening at an Indiana mall after a man with a rifle opened fire in a food court and an armed civilian shot and killed him, police said.The man entered the Greenwood Park Mall with a rifle and several magazines of ammunition and began firing in the food court, Greenwood Police Department Chief Jim Ison said.A 22-year-old from nearby Bartholomew County who was legally carrying a firearm at the mall shot and killed the gunman, Ison said at a news conference.Four of those hit by gunfire were females and one was a male, Ison said. He didn\u2019t immediately know the specific gender or age of those who were killed.He said a 12-year-old girl was among the two injured, both of whom are in stable condition.Police confiscated a suspicious backpack that was in a bathroom near the food court, Ison said.Officers went to the mall at about 6 p.m. for reports of the shooting.\u201cThe real hero of the day is the citizen that was lawfully carrying a firearm in that food court and was able to stop the shooter almost as soon as he began,\u201d Ison said.The mass shooting was just the latest to unnerve Americans in 2022.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostIn case you ever found yourself craving \u201cEuphoria,\u201d but with more orgies, let us introduce you to \u201cThe Idol,\u201d HBO\u2019s latest offering starring Lily-Rose Depp.The new series hails from the \u201csick and twisted minds\u201d of \u201cEuphoria\u201d creator Sam Levinson and Abel Tesfaye, aka The Weeknd, and takes a debaucherous dive into the famously family friendly world of the music industry.Set against a furious haze of bongs, booze and cocaine trays, the trailer released on Sunday promises to tell the \u201cthe sleaziest love story in all of Hollywood\u201d between a rising pop star (Depp) and a self-help guru and possible cult leader (Tesfaye).Depp takes center stage in her television debut to fully inhabit her pop persona named Jocelyn, as she bumps and grinds her way through dance rehearsals, video shoots and recording sessions. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just be yourself?\u201d The Weeknd\u2019s character asks her over dinner in the clip, to which she succinctly replies, \u201cBecause there\u2019s nothing about me that\u2019s relatable.\u201dAn official release date for \u201cThe Idol\u201d has yet to be announced, but the trailer promises it\u2019s \u201ccoming soon.\u201dNot much else is known about the series apart from its troubled production, as the show has undergone multiple delays and a major creative overhaul since it was first announced in June 2021. Series director Amy Seimetz, who was set to helm all seven episodes, exited the project in April, before \u201cRed Rocket\u201d breakout star Suzanna Son also parted ways with the show, only to be replaced with Debby Ryan. A Deadline report later claimed that midway through filming Tesfaye was \u201cunhappy with the creative direction of the show,\u201d which he felt was leaning too heavily into a \u201cfemale perspective\u201d by centering Depp\u2019s character over his own, according to sources.\u201cThe Idol\u2019s creative team continues to build, refine, and evolve their vision for the show and they have aligned on a new creative direction,\u201d a spokeswoman for HBO said at the time. \u201cThe production will be adjusting its cast and crew accordingly to best serve this new approach to the series. We look forward to sharing more information soon.\u201d In addition to Depp and Tesfaye, real-life pop stars Troye Sivan and Jennie Kim of Blackpink star in the series alongside Rachel Sennott, Hari Nef, Elizabeth Berkley, Tunde Adebimpe, Steve Zissis and Anne Heche.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Politics Reporter, HuffPostSen. Mitch McConnell (R) was in his element back home in Kentucky, speaking at a Paducah Area Chamber of Commerce lunch. Early in his appearance, after going through a litany of what he said were President Joe Biden\u2019s failures, he turned to Ukraine as an area of bipartisanship.\u201cLet me just tell you that I think beating the Russians in Ukraine is the single most important thing to world peace that we\u2019re dealing with at the moment. The Russians simply have to be defeated,\u201d he said July 5.\u201cSome people write me and say, \u2018Well, why did we send $40 billion over there?\u2019 Well, the answer to that is it costs us a lot more to do it later,\u201d he said. Some of those people are in McConnell\u2019s own party \u2014 including Donald Trump, who could be the party\u2019s presidential nominee again in 2024. And that presents a problem for McConnell and President Joe Biden. Helping Ukraine, which started off with broad public and bipartisan support, is at risk of becoming yet another casualty of today\u2019s polarized politics. According to Morning Consult polling, while a plurality of all voters see the United States as doing \u201cthe right amount\u201d to help Ukraine, Republican voters were the only group more likely to say the U.S. was doing \u201ctoo much,\u201d at 28%, than too little, 25%.A June poll for the University of Maryland found that willingness to tolerate substantially or somewhat higher levels of energy prices and inflation had dropped off for Republican voters compared to overall voters in a similar March survey.\u201cSome people write me and say, \u2018Well, why did we send $40 billion over there?\u2019 Well, the answer to that is it costs us a lot more to do it later,\u201dWith the war near a standstill in the country\u2019s eastern region, Ukraine will have to come back for more money eventually, and if Republicans win one or both chambers of Congress, it is by no means clear more aid will be forthcoming.Rep. Matt Gaetz, the firebrand House Republican from Florida, said as much in a July 1 exchange with Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.). Answering a Tweet from Gallego that said \u201cFact is if the Republicans take over the House in 2022 US support to Ukraine will come to a halt,\u201d Gaetz replied, \u201cRuben is correct.\u201dAt a recent rally in Anchorage, Alaska, Trump riffed on the cost so far, misstating the amount spent.\u201cLike with Ukraine, we put up $60 billion and Europe put up $5, 6 [billion]? OK?\u201d he said, drawing boos from the crowd. (Through early July, Congress has authorized about $54 billion for assistance not only to Ukraine, but to neighboring countries as well in response to the Russian invasion. )And Trump is by no means alone among Republicans. On the last aid package, 11 GOP senators voted against more money, including Kentucky\u2019s Rand Paul.\u201cWe don\u2019t have any money for anyone,\u201d he told HuffPost. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re a trillion dollars in the hole every year. So any money that is allocated to send to a foreign country has to be borrowed first from another foreign country.\u201dThe outlook in the Senate is arguably better for Ukraine than in the House, with McConnell and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) presenting a mostly united front on the issue so far. In the House, where Republicans have the best chance to take over and where 57 members of the conference voted against the last aid package, the picture is murkier.Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) is expected to get the Speaker\u2019s gavel if the GOP picks up the handful of seats it needs in the fall to win control. But McCarthy\u2019s grip on the conference is somewhat tenuous, which could lead him to have to make promises to secure the 218 votes needed for the speakership.One obvious potential spoiler group: the House Freedom Caucus, which hounded the two most recent Republican speakers, John Boehner and Paul Ryan. Members of the group have complained about the Biden administration caring more about Ukraine\u2019s borders than the U.S.-Mexico border.Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, one of the Freedom Caucus veterans and a vote against the last aid package, said the group has yet to talk about the issue in depth.If Republicans win, supporting further aid to Ukraine would have to be a broader, conference-wide call, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s got to be a conference decision and, look, we haven\u2019t won yet. We\u2019ve got to win,\u201d he said.Requests for comment with McCarthy\u2019s office were not answered.Rep. Steny Hoyer, the Maryland Democrat who is second-in-command in House leadership, said a majority of the House and Senate were not for \u201cgiving up on Ukraine\u201d even if some in the Republican Party were.\u201cMy view is that there are obviously Putin sympathizers \u2014 Trump obviously being one \u2014 within their party. And I think that\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d he said.\u201cPutin must not win this effort, or every two-bit, tinhorn dictator in the world will think they can do the same,\u201d Hoyer said.One GOP aid foe, Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, said she was looking for ways to help Ukraine without using taxpayer dollars. She said she expects another round of aid to be approved this calendar year but she wanted to see if International Monetary Fund reserve assets could be used instead.Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), the second-ranking Senate Republican, said he worried about Ukraine \u201cfatigue\u201d and that there was \u201ca legitimate case\u201d that other NATO allies and Europe pay more.But he also said there was a rising tide of isolationist political sentiment as well.\u201cIt\u2019s a real problem,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be willing to make the case and that\u2019s going to require some leadership.\u201dPolitics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The sheriff\u2019s office identified both the male and the young girl, and said investigators found no evidence supporting White\u2019s allegations.\u201cIt is shameful that a candidate for public office would make up such a story and use it to further his own political agenda,\u201d said Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey R.

Gottlieb made the remarks on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d Sunday, telling host Margaret Brennan that while monkeypox wasn\u2019t going to explode across the nation like the coronavirus, the U.S. should have been able to get it under control with more aggressive measures. Monkeypox, he said, has now become \u201cfirmly embedded in the community\u201d and is likely to persist.\u201cI think, at this point, we\u2019ve failed to contain this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re now at the cusp of this becoming an endemic virus, where this now becomes something that\u2019s persistent that we need to continue to deal with.

The virus spreads primarily through close contact with infected people or animals and cases have, so far, been identified mainly in men who have sex with men.Gottlieb warned the U.S. has been making similar mistakes to contain the monkeypox outbreak as the country did at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, failing to test people early enough and not supplying enough vaccines to make it harder for the virus to spread.Some cities, including New York, have begun vaccination campaigns for those at risk of contracting the disease, but health officials have warned many more doses are needed and demand is exceeding the supply.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Trends Reporter, HuffPostThe Indiana physician who provided an abortion last month to a 10-year-old Ohio rape victim who could not legally obtain one in her home state was once targeted in a vicious kidnapping threat against her daughter, The Guardian reported Friday.Dr. Caitlin Bernard also was \u2014 and continues to be \u2014 ominously listed on the website of a militant anti-abortion group in South Bend, Indiana, called Right To Life Michiana, which has ties to Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett.Bernard testified in a court case last year that she was forced to stop performing abortions at a clinic in South Bend after the FBI alerted the local Planned Parenthood office that a kidnapping threat had been made against Bernard\u2019s daughter, according to The Guardian.At the time, her name was listed among abortion doctors targeted by the Michiana group, along with information about her place of work. All of the information is still on the site.In 2006, Barrett signed a statement published in an advertisement by a group that would later merge with Michiana, saying that all signatories \u201cdefend the right to life from fertilization to natural death,\u201d according to The Guardian. It also called Roe v. Wade, which protected women\u2019s right to abortion for 50 years, \u201cbarbaric.\u201dBarrett would later become a U.S. Supreme Court justice and join the conservative majority to toss out the landmark decision last month.Bernard is now being harangued by Indiana\u2019s Republican Attorney General Todd Rokita, who has falsely claimed she failed to report the 10-year-old girl\u2019s sexual assault and rape, which she did. Rokita was apparently unable to locate the report in his own state\u2019s records \u2014 even though several media outlets did \u2014 before he launched an investigation.Bernard\u2019s lawyers have fired off a cease-and-desist letter to Rokita, telling him to stop spreading lies about her or he will be sued for defamation.Bernard\u2019s spokesperson, Kendra Barkoff Lamy, called the \u201cpersonal and dangerous\u201d threats against the doctor \u201cdevastating.\u201d\u201cSadly, Dr. Bernard is not alone, and this happens to doctors like her who provide abortions across our nation,\u201d she told the Guardian.Bernard\u2019s cease-and-desist letter to Rokita warned that his lying attacks also threatened to incite \u201charassment and violence\u201d against her.As of Saturday evening, Rokita hadn\u2019t yet responded to Bernard\u2019s letter. His office is reportedly \u201creviewing\u201d it.Both Rokita and Republican Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan initially derided the report of the girl\u2019s rape and being forced to cross state lines to obtain an abortion as lies \u2014 until a suspect was charged with the rape this week.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPostSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Saturday said he believes the U.S. Supreme Court \u201cwas overreaching\u201d and \u201cclearly wrong\u201d when it legalized same-sex marriage across the country in the 2015 landmark Obergefell v. Hodges decision.Cruz was speaking on his podcast about the differences between that case and the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, which had previously protected abortion rights nationwide. He criticized the court for preventing individual states from deciding for themselves whether same-sex marriage should be allowed.\u201cObergefell, like Roe v. Wade, ignored two centuries of our nation\u2019s history. Marriage was always an issue that was left to the states,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Obergefell, the court said no, we know better than you guys do, and now every state must sanction and permit gay marriage. I think that decision was clearly wrong when it was decided. It was the court overreaching.\u201dCruz added that he personally doesn\u2019t expect the court to reverse its decision, however, reasoning that \u201cit would be more than a little chaotic\u201d based on the number of same-sex marriages that have already legally taken place.Cruz has previously advocated for allowing individual states to outlaw same-sex marriage. For many, his desire appears closer to a reality due to last month\u2019s Supreme Court ruling on abortion rights in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which ignited concerns that the court might overturn other decisions. Justice Clarence Thomas amplified that concern, stating in a solo concurring opinion that any decision made by the Supreme Court that was stated to be supported by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, such as Roe v. Wade was, should be reconsidered.\u201cAny substantive due process decision is \u2018demonstrably erroneous,\u2019\u201d he said last month, adding that \u201cwe have a duty to \u2018correct the error\u2019 established in those precedents.\u201dOther rulings citing the due process clause include Griswold v. Connecticut, which established the right for married couples to use contraception; Lawrence v. Texas, which prohibits states from banning sexual relations between people of the same sex; and Loving v. Virginia, which protects interracial marriage.Thomas mentioned the Obergefell, Griswold and Lawrence cases in his opinion but not did mention the Loving case, which, if overturned, could threaten his own interracial marriage.Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Politics Reporter, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2014 Many Republicans hailed the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision as a victory for one of their highest-profile priorities: ending abortion. But it comes with a string attached \u2014 more federal spending, which Republicans usually hate.More than 4 in 10 births in the United States \u2014 42% in 2019 \u2014 are paid for by Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor whose costs are split between the federal government and individual states. At an average of $18,865 per birth and with one estimate that there will be more than 150,000 extra births annually because of Dobbs, there will almost certainly be more spending.House Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said he\u2019d like to see Congress\u2019 fiscal umpire, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, put pen to paper on the impact of Dobbs.\u201cI would welcome a CBO score as another way to qualify the damage the Dobbs decision will do to women across the country,\u201d the Kentucky Democrat told HuffPost.To be clear, there are far more pressing concerns about forcing people to have babies. And even just looking at cost, Medicaid doesn\u2019t cover all the many, many costs that come with having a baby who will become a toddler and then a child and then a teenager, and so forth. But for a party that has been so quick to raise the alarm on federal spending over programs like expanding the child tax credit, Republicans are noticeably quiet about the financial cost that outlawing abortion will have. Exactly how much more Medicaid spending Dobbs will entail is unclear. In the past, the CBO has estimated that bills restricting access to abortion would increase births and boost Medicaid spending.Those increases, though, have been relatively small compared to the program\u2019s overall outlays. A House Republican bill in 2015 to defund Planned Parenthood would have increased Medicaid spending by $650 million over 10 years. A 2017 bill GOP bill to restrict abortions after 20 weeks would have increased Medicaid spending by $175 million over 10 years, but the boost in spending could have been as much as $335 million if more people than projected carried their pregnancies to term instead of ending them before 20 weeks. Dobbs\u2019 impact may be several orders of magnitude higher. Taking the Kaiser estimate of $18,865 in birth costs, multiplying that by consulting firm Sg2\u2032s high estimate of extra births and assuming the proportion of Medicaid deliveries stayed the same, the annual tab would be about $1.3 billion a year, or $13 billion over 10 years.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how much to expect, but we know that there are going to be women who are not going to be able to gain access to abortions, they\u2019re not going to be able to travel distances to get abortions they seek. And those births are going to be funded by Medicaid,\u201d said Alina Salganicoff, senior vice president with the Kaiser Family Foundation.\u201cNow, the extent to which that\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s noticeable in the budget, I really don\u2019t know. A lot of it will depend on how successful women are going to be at getting abortions out of state or through self-managed means,\u201d she said.\u201cWe don\u2019t know how much to expect, but we know that there are going to be women who are not going to be able to gain access to abortions, they\u2019re not going to be able to travel distances to get abortions they seek.\u201dMedicaid is a $600 billion-plus a year program, with almost 88 million Americans enrolled in it or its companion CHIP program for kids, and usually one of the top budget line items for states. It has long been a target of anti-spending conservatives who balk at both its costs and the mandates it places on states.Few Republicans this week wanted to talk about the potential cost of Dobbs. A request for comment to Rep. Jason Smith (Mo.), Yarmuth\u2019s GOP counterpart on the House Budget Committee, was not answered. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) ignored the question as he got on an elevator during a Senate vote. Even the National Taxpayers Union did not respond to a request for comment.Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who would likely become the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee if Republicans take the Senate, gave a muted response when questioned.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to reduce the deficit by denying birth,\u201d he said after a Senate vote. \u201cI don\u2019t see denying birth as a deficit reduction plan that anybody supports, OK?\u201dThe budget impact will vary by state, as some provide abortions out of their state share of Medicaid money and others have banned or restricted abortions almost completely in the wake of Dobbs.States that have the most Medicaid births would probably see the biggest impact, and many of them have restricted abortion since the ruling. According to Kaiser, six states as of 2020 had half or more of their births paid for by Medicaid: Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Alabama and Texas. The highest proportion was seen in Louisiana, at 61%, while Alabama and Texas both saw half of their births paid for by Medicaid.Kaiser\u2019s Salganicoff said there would be \u201cdownstream\u201d impacts on Medicaid for years in addition to the costs of increased births.Salganicoff said as recently as 2014 that about 75% of women having abortions were low-income and that over 60% were women of color, with many already having had at least one child. \u201cHonestly, a lot of it\u2019s going to depend on how successful women are going to be getting abortions and how many of them will be having children,\u201d she said.\u201cWe do know that they\u2019re likely going to be low-income children that are going to be covered by Medicaid. And Medicaid pays for a broad range of services in addition to their health coverage, a wide range of services that are going to be important to them if they have also special health care needs as well,\u201d she said.Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostTexas filed a lawsuit against President Joe Biden\u2019s administration Thursday over its guidance that life- or health-saving abortions must be made available to patients, regardless of a state\u2019s laws on the procedure.The guidance in question came in a memo this week from the Department of Health and Human Services that reiterated existing guidance dating back to 1986. The guidance requires that all patients receive appropriate medical care and stabilizing treatment in an emergency situation.Since the fall of Roe v. Wade last month, a number of states have enacted abortion bans, some of which include exceptions for the life and safety of the mother. However, the language in those clauses is often vague and confusing, which creates an incentive for providers not to perform abortions until a patient is moments from death, for fear of losing their license or facing legal repercussions.The Biden administration\u2019s memo is an attempt to address that, but Texas officials have interpreted it as an effort to \u201cuse federal law to transform every emergency room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic\u201d and to force providers into performing abortions, the lawsuit says.\u201cThis administration has a hard time following the law, and now they are trying to have their appointed bureaucrats mandate that hospitals and emergency medicine physicians perform abortions,\u201d Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) said in a statement Thursday. \u201cI will ensure that President Biden will be forced to comply with the Supreme Court\u2019s important decision concerning abortion and I will not allow him to undermine and distort existing laws to fit his administration\u2019s unlawful agenda.\u201dThe White House called it \u201cunthinkable\u201d that a state would try and fight this guidance.\u201cThis is yet another example of an extreme and radical Republican elected official,\u201d White house press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement, referring to Paxton. \u201cIt is unthinkable that this public official would sue to block women from receiving life-saving care in emergency rooms, a right protected under U.S. law.\u201dTexas\u2019 \u201ctrigger ban\u201d on abortion is set to go into effect soon, but providers have already ceased offering the procedure because Paxton argued it\u2019s already outlawed by a pre-Roe ban that was never repealed. The Texas abortion ban does include a clause allowing for life-saving and health-preserving abortions, but it simply calls on providers to use their \u201creasonable medical judgment\u201d when making those decisions. Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe, providers have spoken up about how murky those situations are, and have warned that patients may die while they wait for legal advice on how to proceed in an emergency.The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate among developed nations, an issue that disproportionately affects people of color. In the U.S., Black women are over three times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than white women.Senior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostFormer President Donald Trump tried to call a White House support staffer who has been speaking with the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the Capitol and could have corroborated the damning testimony given by former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson last month. CNN first reported Wednesday that Trump called the support staffer \u2014 whose position had not been identified \u2014 shortly after Hutchinson, an assistant to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, testified publicly before the committee. The support staff member didn\u2019t regularly communicate with the president while Trump was in office, and so the staffer was concerned about the call, CNN added.The witness also could have corroborated part of Hutchinson\u2019s testimony under oath, according to the site\u2019s sources. CNN did not note what specific role the person served in.NBC later reported that it had confirmed CNN\u2019s reporting.Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said it was \u201chighly unusual\u201d for Trump to make the call.Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), a member of the Jan. 6 panel, revealed earlier this week during a hearing that Trump \u201ctried to call\u201d an unnamed witness, saying the person did not pick up the call but had told their lawyer about the communication.\u201cLet me say one more time: We will take any effort to influence witness testimony very seriously,\u201d Cheney said during Tuesday\u2019s hearing, adding that she had referred the matter to the Department of Justice.In Hutchinson\u2019s testimony before the House panel, she told lawmakers that Trump knew the crowd during his \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally preceding the Jan. 6 insurrection was heavily armed and that Meadows told her he thought things could get \u201creal, real bad\u201d that day as Trump tried to retain power after losing the 2020 election. Hutchinson also testified that the then-president tried to grab the wheel of his armored limousine when the Secret Service said they couldn\u2019t take him to the U.S. Capitol for security reasons.Lawmakers have since said her testimony helped uncover new information in its probe, expressing confidence in her accounts despite efforts by Trump and his surrogates to discount her role in the White House.Senior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPostIn the weeks since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, pharmacies across the country have refused to fill certain prescriptions that are the same as or similar to the drugs used in medication abortion. But many of these drugs are used for miscarriage care and ectopic pregnancies, as well as for unrelated health issues like arthritis and stomach ulcers. The Department of Health and Human Services issued a memo on Wednesday in which it reminded pharmacists at the 60,000 pharmacies that receive federal dollars that they are obligated under federal civil rights law to ensure access to comprehensive reproductive health care services and administer prescribed medication \u2014 regardless of whether the recipient is pregnant or able to get pregnant.The HHS guidance points to several sections of the Affordable Care Act that ensure pharmacies cannot discriminate against customers \u201cwith regard to supplying medications; making determinations regarding the suitability of a prescribed medication for a patient; or advising patients about medications and how to take them.\u201dMedication abortion is made up of two types of drugs: mifepristone and misoprostol. When used together, these drugs are commonly used for miscarriage care and abortion care before the 12 weeks of pregnancy. The department was prompted to underline its existing guidance on these drugs because there have been dozens of reports of people being denied them due to confusion since Roe was repealed, according to a senior HHS official. This has even been reported in states where medication abortion is legal or in cases where the medication was being used to save the life of the pregnant person. Some women have also reported pharmacists refusing to fill prescriptions for certain forms of mifepristone even though it was prescribed prior to an IUD insertion. But drugs similar to mifepristone and misoprostol, or other reproductive health care prescriptions like birth control or emergency contraception, have also been caught up in the confusion of a post-Roe world. Heartburn medication has been pulled in some Texas pharmacies because its makeup is similar to that of abortion medications. Some doctors reportedly stopped prescribing methotrexate, a common medication for people with auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn\u2019s disease. Other patients have been wrongly denied their birth control prescriptions or access to emergency contraceptives like Plan B, which are still legal despite the repeal of Roe. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring that everyone can access health care, free of discrimination,\u201d said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. \u201cThis includes access to prescription medications for reproductive health and other types of care.\u201dIf someone believes they have been wrongly denied a prescription, they can file a complaint with HHS on the department\u2019s website. A team will read over the complaint and evaluate whether it warrants opening an investigation. This is one of several actions HHS and the Biden administration have taken in the past week in response to the fall of Roe. Earlier this week, the administration clarified existing guidance that protects doctors and their clinical judgment when providing abortion care in emergency situations. And last week, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to address access to abortion in the wake of the repeal of Roe. The administration promised to protect access to medication abortion, contraception and emergency contraceptives like Plan B. Biden also said he\u2019s considering declaring a public health emergency in order to make certain federal resources available, though the administration has said that\u2019s not likely to happen.Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Speaking on the right-wing Newsmax network on Monday, Navarro \u2015 who was indicted last month for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection \u2015 said: \u201cThe reason why I think Pence is guilty of treason, to at least President Trump and perhaps to this country, is that he acted on the basis of a flawed legal opinion concocted by his own general counsel that he did not share with either the president or with the president\u2019s White House legal counsel. Due process plus duty to the commander in chief required you to do that.\u201d Treason is the only crime specifically defined in the U.S. Constitution. It\u2019s an act of war by an American against the United States or giving aid and comfort to the nation\u2019s enemies.It is not personal disloyalty to a president who is trying to subvert the Constitution and remain in office despite losing the election.But Navarro has his own definition \u2015 and then went even further in his attack on Pence, calling him a traitor. \u201cSo by the time Jan. 6 rolled around, Pence\u2019s actions were kind of baked into the cake based on both traitorous activity with respect to the president and flawed legal opinions,\u201d he said:Navarro: The reason why I think the Pence is guilty of treason to at least Trump and perhaps in this country is that he acted on the basis of a flawed legal opinion pic.twitter.com/qq9YiL9bkGNavarro earlier this year also called Pence a \u201ctraitor\u201d and compared him to a character in \u201cJulius Caesar.\u201d \u201cIt was a tragedy that Mike Pence decided to be a traitor to the American Caesar of Trump,\u201d he said in March on Newsmax, according to Salon. \u201cI liken it in [my book] to a Shakespearean moment, the \u2018Et tu, Brute?\u2019 moment.\u201dNow Navarro\u2019s taking a step further and accusing Pence of treason \u2015 to Trump and \u201cperhaps\u201d the nation \u2015 left his critics aghast on Twitter: The right to remain silent is a concept lost on this weirdo. https://t.co/c85gn6gAuwWhat Navarro claims is a \"flawed legal opinion\" is also known as....

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Trends Reporter, HuffPostFormer President Donald Trump is now desperately attempting to snatch Wisconsin from the jaws of his defeat by suddenly claiming he won the state in the 2020 presidential election.He didn\u2019t.His reasoning? Since the Wisconsin state Supreme Court issued a ruling Friday sharply curtailing the number of drop boxes for absentee ballots, that must mean all the votes in those boxes in November 2020 were somehow fake \u2014 and apparently were all marked for victor Joe Biden. \u201cThis means I won the very closely contested (not actually) Wisconsin Presidential race because they used these corrupt and scandal-ridden Scam Boxes,\u201d he falsely insisted in a post Friday on Truth Social.There is no evidence that the vote in Wisconsin, or anywhere else in the nation, was fraudulent. Dozens of court cases and several recounts state by state verified Biden\u2019s victory.Members of Trump\u2019s own Department of Justice found no evidence of fraud after extensive investigations. Trump\u2019s handpicked attorney general, William Barr, called the election fraud claims \u201cbullshit.\u201d\u201cThese allegations were simply not true,\u201d Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general at the time, told Trump, he testified last month before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. He added that Trump eventually said: \u201cJust say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.\u201dTrump and Republicans have claimed that drop boxes facilitated cheating but have offered no evidence.The conservative-controlled Wisconsin court ruled that under current law, absentee ballot drop boxes may only be placed in election offices and that no one other than the voter can return a ballot in person. \u201cBallot drop boxes appear nowhere in the detailed statutory system for absentee voting,\u201d Justice Rebecca Bradley wrote. There\u2019s no move in Wisconsin to switch Biden\u2019s victory to Trump.Critics say the GOP goal is to significantly decrease the number of votes, which is generally considered beneficial to Republicans. One way to do that it to make voting as inconvenient as possible.Trump said on Fox News in 2020 that \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u201d if \u201cvoting levels\u201d rose. (Research has shown, however, that mail-in ballots don\u2019t appear to give either party a distinct advantage.)Trump continues to push for single-day, in-person voting in elections \u2014 prohibiting convenient mail-in ballots and early voting that 69% of American voters used in 2020. (Trump votes by mail.) That would be challenging especially for the disabled and the elderly, as well as for those working long hours or two jobs or juggling child care.\u201cUltimately, we want same-day voting \u2014 one day \u2014 and only paper ballots,\u201d Trump said to cheers at a rally in Nashville last month.Trends Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 As Donald Trump considers another White House run, polls show he\u2019s the most popular figure in the Republican Party. But it wasn\u2019t always that way.Competing at one point against a dozen rivals for the presidential nomination in 2016, Trump won only about one-third of the vote in key early states. He even lost in Iowa, which kicks off the nomination process.But he prevailed because those in the party who opposed his brand of divisive politics were never able to coalesce around a single rival. That same dynamic could repeat itself as Trump mulls a new bid for the presidency as soon as this summer.With a growing list of candidates gearing up to run, even a Trump diminished by two impeachments and mounting legal vulnerabilities could hold a commanding position in a fractured, multi-candidate primary.\u201cI fear it could end up the same way as 2016, which basically was everyone thought everyone else should get out,\u201d said Republican strategist Mike DuHaime, who advised former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s campaign that year. \u201cI think every major candidate realized that he or she would have a better shot against Trump one-on-one. But of course each person thought he or she should be the one to get that shot and nobody got out of the way. ... And then it was too late.\u201dThe anxiety is mounting as a growing list of potential rivals take increasingly brazen steps, delivering high-profile speeches, running ads, courting donors and making repeat visits to early voting states.That group now includes upward of a dozen could-be-candidates, including Trump\u2019s former vice president, Mike Pence; his former secretary of state, Mike Pompeo; and Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Rick Scott of Florida and Tim Scott of South Carolina. All could run on the former president\u2019s policies.In the anti-Trump lane, politicians such as Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan are raising their profiles.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is increasingly seen as Trump\u2019s heir apparent, even by Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters, and viewed by Trump allies as his most formidable potential challenger.Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and others have said they will not challenge Trump if he does go forward. But others, including Christie, seem to be gunning for the fight, even if they seem to be long shots.\u201cI\u2019m definitely giving it serious thought. I\u2019m not gonna make any decision probably until the end of the year,\u201d Christie said in a recent interview. He has urged the party to move on from Trump and his ongoing obsession with the 2020 election.\u201cFor me, it\u2019s about the party needing to go in in a new direction from a personality perspective, and to continue to have someone who can bring strong leadership, tough leadership, that the country needs, but doesn\u2019t have all of the other drama that goes along with it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hearing the same things from donors that I\u2019m hearing from voters \u2014 that they\u2019re very concerned that we can\u2019t put ourselves in a position to have 2024 be about anything but the good of the country.\u201dPompeo, who has had a busy travel schedule and plans to return to Iowa this summer, said in a recent interview that he has been spending time reading and listening to President Ronald Reagan\u2019s speeches as he prepares for a possible run.\u201cWe\u2019re getting ready to stay in the fight,\u201d he said last month as he courted evangelical Christians at a gathering in Nashville, Tennessee.He said he and his wife would sit down after the November elections and \u201cthink our way through it, pray our way through it, and decide where\u2019s best to serve. It could be presenting ourselves for elected office again. We may choose a different path. But we\u2019re not gonna walk away from these things that I\u2019ve been working on for 30 years now. They matter too much.\u201dPompeo sketched out a possible approach in much the same mold as Trump.\u201cHe was a disruptor that was most necessary in 2016, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Pompeo said. \u201cAnd now the task is to take those set of understandings, those set of principles, and defend them and build upon them. And it\u2019s gonna take a lot of work to do that, leaders of real fortitude and character to do that.\u201dSuch open talk comes as Trump faces a cascade of escalating legal troubles.The congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection has revealed increasingly damaging information about Trump\u2019s final weeks in office. The Department of Justice has its own investigation. In Georgia, the prosecutor investigating Trump\u2019s potentially illegal meddling in the state\u2019s 2020 election has stepped up her inquiry by subpoenaing members of Trump\u2019s inner circle. In New York, Trump, his namesake son and his daughter Ivanka have agreed to answer questions under oath beginning next week in the state attorney general\u2019s civil investigation into his business practices.Mick Mulvaney, a former South Carolina congressman who served as Trump\u2019s acting White House chief of staff, said the moves suggested potential candidates \u201cmight see an opening where none existed two months ago.\u201d\u201cTrump fatigue might be a real thing,\u201d he said, with voters asking themselves whether, if they vote for another candidate, they \u201ccan get the same policies without all the baggage.\u201dAt the same time, Trump has seen some of his endorsed primary candidates falter. Those who have won, including Senate hopefuls JD Vance in Ohio and Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, have done so with about 30% of the vote, meaning that two-thirds of party voters went against Trump\u2019s picks.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody underestimates Trump. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s the most sought-after endorsement in every single Republican primary,\u201d said GOP strategist Alex Conant. \u201cThat said, I think there\u2019s a recognition that a lot of Republican voters are looking to the future and ready for what\u2019s next.\u201dTo what extent remains an open question. During a trip to Iowa this week, Cotton declined to weigh in on Trump\u2019s standing. But the senator said he hoped to be \u201can effective national leader, not only for my party but for the American people in my role in the Senate and any other future role I might serve.\u201dStill, Cotton argued, candidates should embrace Trump\u2019s legacy.\u201cI know that Donald Trump is very popular among our voters who appreciate the successes he delivered for four years in a very hostile environment. They don\u2019t want Republicans who are running against that legacy, because they view that legacy as a great success,\u201d he said Thursday in Cambridge, Iowa.Trump continues to move forward with his own events.On Friday night, he campaigned in Las Vegas alongside Adam Laxalt, his pick for Nevada Senate. And on Saturday night, he planned a rally in Anchorage, Alaska, to campaign with Kelly Tshibaka, whom he has endorsed in her race against Sen. Lisa Murkowski, and others, including former Gov. Sarah Palin, now running for Congress.Conant said it made sense for candidates to continue testing the waters for now.\u201cA lot of potential candidates are realizing that 2024 may be their last best chance, regardless of what Trump does,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a very vulnerable Democrat in the White House, Republicans seem likely to win, and if it\u2019s not Trump, they\u2019re basically sidelined for the next 10 years.\u201dStill, Conant, who served as communications director to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential bid, noted the similarities.\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s increasingly clear there\u2019s going to be a lot of people running for president. And while I think there\u2019s an appetite for something different, the alternative to Trump needs to coalesce around one candidate,\u201d he said. \u201cThat never happened in 2016. And it might not happen in 2024.\u201d__Associated Press writers Thomas Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, and Steve Peoples contributed to this report.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Editor, HuffPostOn June 24, mere hours after the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade and upended abortion rights in America, a truck driver sized up a group of protesters crossing the street in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and put his foot on the gas.The victims \u2014 all of them women \u2014 were among the last few people in a group of about 100 trying to cross a busy downtown intersection safely via the crosswalk. They described the attack as a slow-motion horror show: A visibly irritated driver maneuvered his truck around the car in front of him and then beelined it through the intersection, directly toward the protesters.He slowed down as his bumper met with the outstretched arms of the women still in the crosswalk. But he didn\u2019t stop.\u201cWe made eye contact at that point. And I saw hate. Just hate,\u201d said one of the women, who asked to remain anonymous for her safety. She spoke through tears as she continued, \u201cHe screamed at me to move, and I remember shouting \u2018No,\u2019 and he started driving. And that\u2019s when I knew I was going to get run over.\u201dThe driver \u2014 whose identity police haven\u2019t made public \u2014 pushed forward, bowling the women over before he left the scene, witnesses said. Several were hospitalized, including one woman who suffered a concussion and another whose ankle had been rolled over.Multiple high-profile members of the community attended the march and witnessed the attack, including a local bartender, a city councilwoman, a county prosecutor (who had his wife and two young daughters in tow), and a journalist. Initially, witnesses thought they might have an open-and-shut case in front of them: They had witness statements from community leaders, footage of the incident from multiple angles, and they all saw the same thing.But in the hours and days that followed, they learned the same harsh lesson that many other communities had learned in the previous few years: The system was set up to support the driver in this situation, not the protesters they hit.In 2021, Iowa Republicans passed a bill that effectively eliminated civil liability for drivers who hit protesters in the street, and increased various penalties for protesters. The bill was championed by Gov. Kim Reynolds, whose own SUV driver struck a Black Lives Matter protester in the heat of the 2020 demonstrations (state police blamed the protester). While it remains to be seen how those laws might affect the case in Cedar Rapids, two women who\u2019d been hit by the truck wondered aloud in interviews with HuffPost whether they might face charges instead of the driver.\u201cWe made eye contact at that point. And I saw hate. Just hate.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear whether charges will be filed at all. Cedar Rapids police made contact with the driver the day of the attack, but declined to press charges at the time, a department spokesman confirmed. The county attorney, Nick Maybanks, saw the entire incident, but he told HuffPost that his new role as a case witness meant he had to recuse himself as prosecutor. (He forwarded the case to Black Hawk County Attorney Brian Williams, who said his office hadn\u2019t gone through any evidence yet, let alone made any charging decisions.)The sobering reality now coming into focus is that the attack on this community isn\u2019t particularly unique or surprising. Taken alongside recent incidents of political violence across America, the Cedar Rapids attack is an almost insignificant data point on a densely packed timeline.In fact, vehicular assaults against protesters amount to a crisis in their own right. Incidents have skyrocketed since the summer of 2020, when millions of protesters took the streets to demonstrate against police violence and bigotry following the murder of George Floyd by an officer in May. Data collected by The Washington Post proved that those protests were overwhelmingly peaceful \u2014 no injuries or property damage were reported in more than 96% of events \u2014 and yet protesters across the country were met with vitriol, authoritarian crackdowns and physical violence from then-President Donald Trump and his administration.Trump called them \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cthugs,\u201d and deployed federal troops to events, where they attacked protesters and disappeared them in unmarked vans. Fox News, meanwhile, was churning out disinformation and lies surrounding those rallies, using isolated footage and even doctored images to manufacture a false sense that entire American cities had fallen to BLM and antifa.And the vilification worked. Everyday people really seemed to want to kill protesters: The Boston Globe analyzed 139 cases of vehicles ramming protesters in just 16 months following Floyd\u2019s death, leading to more than 100 injuries and three deaths. The Cedar Rapids community remembers that era well, because their state was home to no fewer than four vehicular attacks against protesters in 2020 alone.Today, political violence is a regular feature at civic events, and not just at far-right and MAGA rallies. Gun violence is an ever-present threat across the country, and even on the rare day where a mass shooting doesn\u2019t happen, droves of armed demonstrators and militia groups show up to political events to ensure that the specter remains. Meanwhile, far-right street gangs like the Proud Boys are now mobilizing to all manner of community gatherings in service to the right wing\u2019s various grievances.When the GOP was up in arms about LGBTQ issues, armed Proud Boys rushed drag events, and their fascist cousins in a group called Patriot Front threatened community Pride celebrations. When the right-wing conspiracy theory of the day was that The Walt Disney Co. was grooming children, Proud Boys showed up to Disney events and threatened attendees, calling them \u201cpedophiles.\u201d And when Roe was overturned and liberal demonstrators filled the streets, the Proud Boys and heavily armed members of various militia groups showed up to intimidate the crowds. These incidents are accelerating as election season draws nearer.This appears to be the new normal in America. Politically charged violence, having gone unchecked for years, is no longer a fear but an expectation for many politically active Americans. For Cedar Rapids residents, it\u2019s not a question of if, but when.\u201cObviously this is going to happen again,\u201d said another woman struck by the truck, who asked not to be named. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019ll be in Cedar Rapids, but it happens everywhere, all the time, so it will happen again, and the public response will be predictably terrible.\u201dShe paused, then continued: \u201cKnowing that, what I\u2019m trying to figure out now is, what do you do after this happens? What do you do?\u201dAndy Campbell is the author of \u201cWe Are Proud Boys: How a Right-Wing Street Gang Ushered in a New Era of American Extremism,\u201d coming to bookstores on Sept. 20.Senior Editor, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 As missed warning signs pile up in investigations of mass killings, New York state is rolling out a novel strategy to screen applicants for gun permits. People seeking to carry concealed handguns will be required to hand over their social media accounts for a review of their \u201ccharacter and conduct.\u201dIt\u2019s an approach applauded by many Democrats and national gun control advocacy groups, but some experts have raised questions about how the law will be enforced and address free speech concerns.Some of the local officials who will be tasked with reviewing the social media content also are asking whether they'll have the resources and, in some cases, whether the law is even constitutional.Sheriffs haven\u2019t received additional money or staffing to handle a new application process, said Peter Kehoe, the executive director of the New York Sheriffs\u2019 Association. The law, he asserted, infringes on Second Amendment rights, and while applicants must list their social media accounts, he doesn't think local officials will necessarily look at them.\u201cI don\u2019t think we would do that,\u201d Kehoe said. \u201cI think it would be a constitutional invasion of privacy.\u201dThe new requirement, which takes effect in September, was included in a law passed last week that sought to preserve some limits on firearms after the Supreme Court ruled that most people have a right to carry a handgun for personal protection. It was signed by Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, who noted shooters sometimes telegraph their intent to hurt others.Increasingly, young men have gone online to drop hints of what\u2019s to come before executing a mass killing, including the gunman who killed 19 children and two teachers at an Uvalde, Texas, elementary school.Under the law, applicants have to provide local officials with a list of current and former social media accounts from the previous three years. It will be up to local sheriff's staff, judges or country clerks to scroll through those profiles as they check whether applicants have made statements suggesting dangerous behavior.The law also will require applicants to undergo hours of safety training, prove they\u2019re proficient at shooting, provide four character references and sit for in-person interviews.The law reflects how the Supreme Court ruling has shifted responsibility to states for vetting those who carry firearms in public, said Tanya Schardt, senior counsel and director of state and federal policy for gun control advocacy organization Brady.Her group said it was not aware of any other states requiring gun permit applicants to submit social media profiles.The new approach, however, comes amid growing debate over the policing of social media posts and a legacy of unwarranted surveillance of Black and brown communities.\u201cThe question should be: Can we do this in an anti-racist way that does not create another set of violence, which is the state violence that happens through surveillance?\u201d said University of Pennsylvania social policy, communications and medicine professor Desmond Upton Patton, who also founded SAFElab, a research initiative studying violence involving youths of color.Meanwhile, gun rights advocates are blasting the law.\u201cYou\u2019re also going to have to tell them your social media accounts because New York wants to thoroughly investigate you to figure out if you\u2019re some of those dangerous law-abiding citizens who are taking the country by storm and causing crime to skyrocket,\u201d Jared Yanis, host of the YouTube channel Guns & Gadgets, says in a widely viewed video on the new law. \u201cWhat have we come to?\u201dHochul, who also has tasked state police with routing out extremism online, didn't immediately respond to a list of questions about the social media requirement, including how the state will address free speech and privacy concerns.\u201cOften the sticking point is: How do we go about enforcing this?\u201d Metro State University criminal justice professor James Densley, cofounder of research initiative The Violence Project, said. \u201cI think it starts to open up a bit of a can of worms, because no one quite knows the best way to go about doing it.\u201dIt can be tricky, he said, to decode social media posts by younger people, who could simply be expressing themselves by posting a music video.\u201cWhere this will get tricky is to what extent this is expression and to what extent is this evidence of wrongdoing?\u201d Densley said.Spokespeople for the social media platforms Facebook, Twitter, 4Chan and Parler didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.New York should instead consider giving the job to a trained group tasked with figuring out how to best reach out to people online who are showing signs of radicalization or trauma and may need help, Patton said.\u201cThere's a lot of nuance and contextual issues. We speak differently; how we communicate, that could be misunderstood,\u201d Patton said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned we don\u2019t have the right people or the right tools in place to do this in a way that\u2019s useful in actually preventing violence.\u201dAdam Scott Wandt, a public policy professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that he supports gun control, but that he worries the New York law could set a precedent for mandatory disclosure of social media activity for people seeking other types of licenses from the state.New York's law is rushed and vague, said Wandt, who teaches law enforcement personnel how to conduct searches on people through social media.\u201cI think that what we might have done as a state here in New York is, we may have confirmed their worst fears \u2014 that a slippery slope will be created that will slowly reduce their rights to carry guns and allow a bureaucracy to decide, based on unclear criteria, who can have a gun and who cannot,\u201d Wandt said. \u201cWhich is exactly what the Supreme Court was trying to avoid.\u201d___Maysoon Khan is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Social Justice ReporterOn April 4, a police officer shot Patrick Lyoya at point-blank range in the back of the head during a traffic stop in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Two months later, Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker announced he was charging the officer, Christopher Schurr, with second-degree murder \u2014 making Schurr the first officer from the Grand Rapids Police Department to be charged with felony murder in the shooting of a civilian. The shooting, filmed by a witness, ignited outrage on social media. Lyoya\u2019s death didn\u2019t spark the same nationwide outrage as the killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, but it raised tensions in Grand Rapids and underlined the often-dangerous role police can play in minor traffic stops. Schurr said he pulled over Lyoya, a 26-year-old Black man, because his license plates were expired. Lyoya attempted to get away, and after a brief struggle, Schurr pulled out his gun and shot Lyoya in the back of the head while kneeling on top of him. Jack Glaser, a professor focusing on racial bias and law enforcement at the University of California, Berkeley, said body camera footage of the traffic stop shows Schurr approaching Lyoya aggressively. \u201cYou can go back and say the stop itself started on a bad note and was probably unnecessary,\u201d Glaser told HuffPost. \u201cThe officer is very aggressive and moved in quickly and really contributes to a fraught situation where he is trying to get compliance and Mr. Lyoya is confused.\u201dIn the wake of recent police killings and shootings of people of color, the Police Reform Commission in Washington, D.C., proposed to the city council last year that police should no longer be responsible for addressing traffic violations. The commission suggested the Department of Transportation should handle them instead.In March, Los Angeles police approved new limitations on pretextual stops, or traffic stops in which officers pull someone over because they suspect they\u2019ve committed another crime. If officers do make the stop, they will have to record it with a body-worn camera and state why they think a more serious crime occurred. In December, Pittsburgh banned traffic stops for minor violations \u2014 like broken taillights or headlights or improperly placed license plates \u2014 after the city council approved legislation it said should reduce traffic stops of people of color. Police have killed more than 400 motorists in the last five years who did not have a gun or knife and were not pursued for a violent crime, according to a 2021 New York Times investigation. More than three-quarters of the victims, like Lyoya, were trying to flee the stop. \u201cWe see this again and again, and there is not a good reason why armed police officers should be responding to enforcement,\u201d Samuel Sinyangwe, a policing analyst who founded the police scorecard and maps police violence, told HuffPost.Many other policing experts agree. David Gans, director of the Human Rights, Civil Rights, & Citizenship program at the Constitutional Accountability Center, told HuffPost that police involvement in traffic stops is leading to \u201chorrific\u201d outcomes.Gans drew comparisons between Lyoya\u2019s case and the killing of Philando Castile, a Black man who was killed in front of his child after he was stopped for a minor traffic violation in a suburb of Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 2016.\u201cIn the last number of years, we have seen time and time again how traffic stops end up with police killing unarmed Black men and women,\u201d Gans said. \u201cJurisdictions are recognizing that.\u201dLansing is the only police department in Michigan to rethink how it allows officers to handle minor traffic violations. Cle Jackson, the president of the Grand Rapids NAACP, said his city should follow suit in the wake of Lyoya\u2019s death.\u201cFor minor traffic infractions, I don\u2019t think officers should be making stops related to that nature,\u201d Jackson told HuffPost. \u201cAt the end of the day, no one should lose their life. It should not escalate to that level.\u201dAfter the footage of Lyoya\u2019s killing was released, some lawmakers demanded more accountability for state and local law enforcement, and his family members are planning to file a civil lawsuit after they receive details from a Freedom of Information Act request.Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.) introduced the OATH Act, which would set up a pilot program that increases funding for police body camera training. For reasons that remain unclear, Schurr\u2019s camera turned off shortly before he killed Lyoya. Police officials have theorized that the camera was knocked off while Schurr pinned Lyoya down.\u201cWhile body-worn cameras are intended to be a tool for accountability, there have been too many instances where BWCs have been mishandled. And oftentimes, footage that is captured is reviewed only after an incident occurs,\u201d Lawrence said in a press release after introducing the legislation in April.Michigan also announced it would restart its pattern and practice investigation into the Grand Rapids City police department \u2014 which would address the tactical approach officers take in policing the community. The investigation will examine whether officers are purposely and disproportionately over-policing Black residents and other residents of color.Meanwhile, all eyes will be on Schurr\u2019s trial.Schurr has been fired from the Grand Rapids Police Department. He\u2019s the first officer from the department to be criminally indicted on a murder charge, according to the Kent County Prosecutor\u2019s office. If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole.For police accountability advocates, the decision to charge Schurr came as a surprise, especially since the department initially refused to release his name after the shooting.Miriam Aukerman, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, said withholding Schurr\u2019s name was \u201cdamaging to the integrity\u201d of the investigation. Police Chief Eric Winstrom decided to release his name more than two weeks after the shooting because it was already publicly circulating.The NAACP\u2019s Jackson hopes to see accountability for Lyoya\u2019s death, but struggles with the 26-year-old being another person killed by police.\u201cNow Patrick is a part of that class of alumni who have been slaughtered in the streets by an officer who was trigger-happy and could have totally defused the situation,\u201d Jackson said.

That same year, a Colorado man was arrested outside a Beverly Hills home owned by Swift with a knife, a rope and ammunition.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Wade. States are now allowed to ban the procedure.The girl was referred for an abortion on Monday, three days after the Roe decision, to Indianapolis obstetrician-gynecologist Dr. Caitlin Bernard, she told the Indy Star. Bernard had been contacted by a colleague, a child abuse doctor in Ohio, who had determined that the girl was six weeks and three days pregnant, according to the newspaper. The girl was soon en route to Bernard\u2019s care. There were no other details about her situation.Ohio prohibits an abortion when so-called fetal cardiac activity begins, around six weeks. Several groups filed a lawsuit seeking to block the state law from taking effect on Wednesday. But an emergency stay of the abortion ban was rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court Friday, which means the ban can be upheld while the case is being reviewed, the Cincinnati Enquirer reported.Future sexual assault victims like the 10-year-old will likely soon not have the option to travel to Indiana for an abortion. Indiana lawmakers are expected to further restrict or ban abortions. The Indiana General Assembly will convene in a special session July 25 when it will discuss changes to the law.Until then, doctors are reporting a major increase in the number of out-of-state patients desperately seeking to terminate a pregnancy now that abortions are banned in their states.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine that in just a few short weeks we will have no ability to provide that care,\u201d Bernard said.Bernard could not immediately be reached for comment by HuffPost.Another 10-year-old who was raped and pregnant was also battling for an abortion recently \u2014 in Brazil.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014Abortion, guns and religion \u2014 a major change in the law in any one of these areas would have made for a fateful Supreme Court term. In its first full term together, the court\u2019s conservative majority ruled in all three and issued other significant decisions limiting the government\u2019s regulatory powers.And it has signaled no plans to slow down.With three appointees of former President Donald Trump in their 50s, the six-justice conservative majority seems poised to keep control of the court for years to come, if not decades.\u201cThis has been a revolutionary term in so many respects,\u201d said Tara Leigh Grove, a law professor at the University of Texas. \u201cThe court has massively changed constitutional law in really big ways.\u201dIts remaining opinions issued, the court began its summer recess Thursday, and the justices will next return to the courtroom in October.Overturning Roe v. Wade and ending a nearly half-century guarantee of abortion rights had the most immediate impact, shutting down or severely restricting abortions in roughly a dozen states within days of the decision.In expanding gun rights and finding religious discrimination in two cases, the justices also made it harder to sustain gun control laws and lowered barriers to religion in public life.Setting important new limits on regulatory authority, they reined in the government\u2019s ability to fight climate change and blocked a Biden administration effort to get workers at large companies vaccinated against COVID-19.The remarkable week at the end of June in which the guns, abortion, religion and environmental cases were decided at least partially obscured other notable events, some of them troubling.New Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson was sworn in Thursday as the first Black woman on the court. She replaced the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, who served nearly 28 years, a switch that won\u2019t change the balance between liberals and conservatives on the court.In early May, the court had to deal with the unprecedented leak of a draft opinion in the abortion case. Chief Justice John Roberts almost immediately ordered an investigation, about which the court has been mum ever since. Soon after, workers encircled the court with 8-foot-high fencing in response to security concerns. In June, police made a late-night arrest of an armed man near Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Maryland home, and charged him with attempted murder of the justice.Kavanaugh is one of three Trump appointees along with Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett who fortified the right side of the court. Greg Garre, who served as former President George W. Bush\u2019s top Supreme Court lawyer, said when the court began its term in October \u201cthe biggest question was not so much which direction the court was headed in, but how fast it was going. The term answers that question pretty resoundingly, which is fast.\u201dThe speed also revealed that the chief justice no longer has the control over the court he held when he was one of five, not six, conservatives, Garre said.Roberts, who favors a more incremental approach that might bolster perceptions of the court as a nonpolitical institution, broke most notably with the other conservatives in the abortion case, writing that it was unnecessary to overturn Roe, which he called a \u201cserious jolt\u201d to the legal system. On the other hand, he was part of every other ideologically divided majority.If the past year revealed limits on the chief justice\u2019s influence, it also showcased the sway of Justice Clarence Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court. He wrote the decision expanding gun rights and the abortion case marked the culmination of his 30-year effort on the Supreme Court to get rid of Roe, which had stood since 1973.Abortion is just one of several areas in which Thomas is prepared to jettison court precedents. The justices interred a second of their decisions, Lemon v. Kurtzman, in ruling for a high school football coach\u2019s right pray on the 50-yard line following games. It\u2019s not clear, though, that other justices are as comfortable as Thomas in overturning past decisions.The abortion and guns cases also seemed contradictory to some critics in that the court handed states authority over the most personal decisions, but limited state power in regulating guns. One distinction the majorities in those cases drew, though, is that the Constitution explicitly mentions guns, but not abortion.Those decisions do not seem especially popular with the public, according to opinion polls. Polls show a sharp drop in the court\u2019s approval rating and in people\u2019s confidence in the court as an institution.Justices on courts past have acknowledged a concern about public perception. As recently as last September, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said, \u201cMy goal today is to convince you that this court is not comprised of a bunch of partisan hacks.\u201d Barrett spoke in at a center named for Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who engineered her rapid confirmation in 2020 and was sitting on the stage near the justice.But the conservatives, minus Roberts, rejected any concern about perception in the abortion case, said Grove, the University of Texas professor.Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion that \u201cnot only are we not going to focus on that, we should not focus on that,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic as an academic, but I was surprised to see that coming from that many real-world justices.\u201dThe liberal justices, though, wrote repeatedly that the court\u2019s aggressiveness in this epic term was doing damage to the institution. Justice Sonia Sotomayor described her fellow justices as \u201ca restless and newly constituted Court.\u201d Justice Elena Kagan, in her abortion dissent, wrote: \u201cThe Court reverses course today for one reason and one reason only: because the composition of this Court has changed.\u201dIn 18 decisions, at least five conservative justices joined to form a majority and all three liberals were in dissent, roughly 30% of all the cases the court heard in its term that began last October.Among these, the court also:\u2014 Made it harder for people to sue state and federal authorities for violations of constitutional rights.\u2014 Raised the bar for defendants asserting their rights were violated, ruling against a Michigan man who was shackled at trial.\u2014 Limited how some death row inmates and others sentenced to lengthy prison terms can pursue claims that their lawyers did a poor job representing them.In emergency appeals, also called the court\u2019s \u201cshadow\u201d docket because the justices often provide little or no explanation for their actions, the conservatives ordered the use of congressional districts for this year\u2019s elections in Alabama and Louisiana even though lower federal courts have found they likely violated the federal Voting Rights Act by diluting the power of Black voters.The justices will hear arguments in the Alabama case in October, among several high-profile cases involving race or elections, or both.Also when the justices resume hearing arguments the use of race as a factor in college admissions is on the table, just six years after the court reaffirmed its permissibility. And the court will consider a controversial Republican-led appeal that would vastly increase the power of state lawmakers over federal elections, at the expense of state courts.These and cases on the intersection of LGBTQ and religious rights and another major environmental case involving development and water pollution also are likely to result in ideologically split decisions.Khiara Bridges, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, law school, drew a link between the voting rights and abortion cases. In the latter, Alito wrote in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization that abortion should be decided by elected officials, not judges.\u201cI find it to be incredibly disingenuous for Alito to suggest that all that Dobbs is doing is returning this question to the states and that people can battle in the state about whether to protect fetal life or the interest of the pregnant person,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cBut that same court is actively involved in insuring that states can disenfranchise people.\u201dBridges also said the outcomes aligned almost perfectly with the political aims of Republicans. \u201cWhatever the Republican party wants, the Republican party is going to get out of the currently constituted court,\u201d she said.Defenders of the court\u2019s decisions said the criticism misses the mark because it confuses policy with law. \u201cSupreme Court decisions are often not about what the policy should be, but rather about who (or which level of government, or which institution) should make the policy,\u201d Princeton University political scientist Robert George wrote on Twitter.For now, there is no sign that either the justices or Republican and conservative interests that have brought so many of the high-profile cases to the court intend to trim their sails, Grove said.That\u2019s in part because there\u2019s no realistic prospect of court reforms that would limit the cases the justices could hear, impose term limits or increase the size of the Supreme Court, said Grove, who served on President Joe Biden\u2019s bipartisan Supreme Court commission on court reforms.___Associated Press writer Jessica Gresko contributed to this report.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostA Florida pediatrician has been booted off a state-appointed public health board of directors for statements about COVID-19 vaccines that displeased at least one Republican elected official. The pediatrician, Dr. Lisa Gwynn, had been advocating for equal access to the vaccine for children under 5 years old at a time when the state of Florida was running counter to health advice from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Florida is the only state that has not ordered vaccines for young children, despite the CDC\u2019s recommendation that children under 5 be given the shots to protect against severe illness and death by the coronavirus.Gwynn\u2019s medical recommendation provoked a harsh response from Florida\u2019s chief financial officer, Jimmy Petronis, an ally of the state\u2019s hard-right Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who has peddled misleading information about the vaccines and encouraged residents to do their own research on the pandemic. Both men are up for reelection this year.The doctor was removed Wednesday from her position on the board of directors of the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation, a state health insurance provider, after being appointed several months earlier.Petronis\u2019 deputy chief of staff, Susan Miller, told Gwynn in an email viewed by HuffPost that she had made \u201csome very political statements that do not reflect the CFO\u2019s point of view.\u201d Gwynn told HuffPost she received no prior warning or offer to discuss the situation. On the same day that we began administering COVID-19 vaccine to infants and children under 5, I was removed from the Florida Healthy Kids Board for advocating for equitable access for the underserved and for pediatricians. Disappointing. @FloridaAAP @AmerAcadPeds @CNN pic.twitter.com/7fPlXCtrVKMiller accused the doctor of \u201cgoing so far as to say that the state is \u2018obstruct[ing]\u2019 access to vaccines,\u201d an apparent reference to a June 17 press release from the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.Gwynn, who is president of the FCAAP, is quoted as saying, \u201cThe state\u2019s decision to obstruct access to COVID-19 vaccines is anti-science, an affront to parental rights, and an intrusion into the relationship between doctors, patients, and the families they serve.\u201dIn the U.S., coronavirus vaccine distribution is done on a state-by-state basis, with state leaders putting in large orders for the drugs on behalf of localized health care providers. Because DeSantis refuses to put in an order for Florida, parents of young kids in the state are limited in where they can go to get the shots, the FCAAP says. Miller went on: \u201cThe CFO does not share your opinion and believes that the state has gone to great lengths to protect lives in the face of the Coronavirus.\u201dPetronis has no medical background. Gwynn called the decision \u201cdisappointing\u201d in a tweet. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a matter of opinion or views,\u201d she said in a recorded interview with local station WSVN. \u201cThis was just stating the fact of the consequences of the decision that was made by the surgeon general to not have local health departments carry the COVID vaccine for children under 5.\u201dFlorida parents have reported difficulty in finding appointments for their kids to get vaccinated.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the Biden administration properly ended a Trump-era policy forcing some U.S. asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico.The justices\u2019 5-4 decision for the administration came in a case about the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy under President Donald Trump. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the decision and was joined by fellow conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh as well as the court\u2019s three liberal justices \u2014 Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.President Joe Biden suspended the program on his first day in office in January 2021. But lower courts ordered it reinstated in response to a lawsuit from Republican-led Texas and Missouri. The current administration has sent far fewer people back to Mexico than did the Trump administration.The heart of the legal fight was about whether immigration authorities, with far less detention capacity than needed, had to send people to Mexico or whether they had the discretion under federal law to release asylum-seekers into the United States while they awaited their hearings.About 70,000 people were enrolled in the program, formally known as Migrant Protection Protocols, after President Donald Trump launched it in 2019 and made it a centerpiece of efforts to deter asylum-seekers.After Biden\u2019s suspension of the program, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ended it in June 2021. In October, the department produced additional justifications for the policy\u2019s demise, to no avail in the courts.The program resumed in December, but barely 3,000 migrants had enrolled by the end of March, during a period when authorities stopped migrants about 700,000 times at the U.S.-Mexico border.Democratic-led states and progressive groups were on the administration\u2019s side.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "It had been a long time since Bookmarks, a nonprofit literary arts organization, was able to hold its normal programming in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. But as the staff began to feel more comfortable holding events during the coronavirus pandemic, they planned a Drag Queen Story Hour for last weekend. It was nothing particularly new, and they had hosted one before the pandemic, too. But what was supposed to be a way for children to learn and have some fun turned into an opportunity for conservative protesters to lob false, hurtful and dangerous accusations.A handful of protesters came out to Bookmarks, and while they were met with a much larger counter-protest, the nonprofit organization also received phone calls and emails from angry conservatives.\u201cIt\u2019s just shocking to us the level of hatred we received,\u201d Jamie Rogers Southern, the executive director of Bookmarks, told HuffPost. \u201cIt was an emotional week for us.\u201dSouthern said most of the callers were badly confused about drag shows. \u201cA lot of it is unfortunately misguided and ill-informed statements about how drag queens were pornography or a strip show,\u201d she said. The protesters were fully convinced that this was a publicly funded event, she said, and believed that kids would \u201cbecome\u201d transgender just from looking at a drag queen. (No tax dollars were used.)Bookmarks is not alone. Earlier this month, a drag queen story time in California was interrupted by the Proud Boys, an extremist hate group. Members of the group stormed the event and yelled homophobic and transphobic slurs. And Last weekend, members of the Proud Boys protested a drag queen story time at a library in Nevada. Parents and children ran into the building after a man allegedly pulled out a gun. The sudden backlash to previously uncontroversial events didn\u2019t come out of nowhere. In the last few months, the conservative movement has doubled down on its attacks on queer people. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) revoked Disney World\u2019s special tax status after the corporation released a statement in opposition to the state\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, which is now law and restricts Florida teachers from talking about sexual orientation and gender in the classroom. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) ordered the state\u2019s child protective services to investigate the parents of transgender children, claiming that getting their children\u2019s gender-affirming care is tantamount to abuse. Republican leaders and activists are cloaking their homophobia and transphobia in concern for children. But behind every \u201cWon\u2019t somebody think of the kids?\u201d wail is the real motivation: the desire to control and enforce strict gender roles.And family drag shows are the new catnip for this ultra-regressive movement. \u201cRepublican leaders and activists are cloaking their homophobia and transphobia in concern for children. But behind every \u201cWon\u2019t somebody think of the kids?\u201d wail is the real motivation: the desire to control and enforce strict gender roles.\u201dThe protest in Winston-Salem came just weeks after a video of a similar confrontation in Dallas went viral.In the video, drag queens could be seen leading a group of kids down a makeshift runway, doing age-appropriate dances and poses while parents looked on and cheered.\u201cTake your children to CHURCH, not drag bars,\u201d Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) tweeted without a hint of acknowledgment of the child sexual abuse scandals at various churches.After the video went viral, DeSantis, who is well-versed in attacking the LGBTQ community, said that he would be open to having child protective services in his state investigate parents who take their children to drag shows.\u201cIt used to be kids would be off-limits. Used to be everybody agreed with that,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cNow it just seems like there\u2019s a concerted effort to be exposing kids more and more to things that are not age-appropriate.\u201dFlorida state Rep. Anthony Sabatini (R) tweeted that he would \u201cbe proposing Legislation to charge w/ a Felony & terminate the parental rights of any adult who brings a child to these perverted sex shows aimed at FL kids.\u201dElsewhere in Texas, state Rep. Bryan Slaton (R) tweeted that he would soon introduce a bill that would ban drag shows in the presence of children.\u201cThe events of this past weekend were horrifying and show a disturbing trend in which perverted adults are obsessed with sexualizing children,\u201d he wrote in a press release. \u201cAs a father of two young children, I know I would never take my children to a drag show.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear how a bill like this would work, or what it would entail. Would children be banned from watching \u201cMrs. Doubtfire\u201d? The 1993 classic stars Robin Williams as a divorced dad who dresses in drag and poses as a housekeeper to remain close to his children. Or what about the Madea films, which famously star Tyler Perry as the matriarch of a large Black family?Because drag queens are a large part of the LGBTQ community, they\u2019re automatically a part of the conservative culture war on anyone who isn\u2019t straight, white and cisgender. And, as Republicans in power have made clear, those are the only type of people who are acceptable in their vision for America.In the same way attacks on critical race theory were posited as efforts to keep kids safe from discrimination, bloviating about storytime with drag queens as perverted is simply a cover for the real end goal.Conservatives conflate drag queens reading books to children with the sexualization of children because hypocrisy has no bounds.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "TORONTO (AP) \u2014 Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau warned Saturday that the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn a constitutional right to abortion could lead to the loss of other rights and indicated his country would continue to allow Americans to get abortions in Canada.Trudeau called the court\u2019s decision \u201chorrific\u201d and voiced concern that the ruling could someday allow a rollback of legal protections for gay relationships, including the right for same-sex couples to marry.\u201cWe know that this is an extremely, not just scary, but disheartening time for so many women,\u201d Trudeau said at a news conference in Kigali, Rwanda, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. \u201cWomen for generations have fought for more rights in the United States, (only) to see this setback, to worry as well about how this can be expanded to more rights be taken away in the United States,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is a reminder of how we need to be unequivocal in our defense of people\u2019s rights, in not taking anything for granted, in staying vigilant, and always standing up for woman\u2019s rights, for LBGT rights, for the rights of people who are disenfranchised and marginalized,\u201d he added.Asked if his government would help American women seeking abortions in Canada, Trudeau did not directly respond, but said: \u201cEveryday Americans who find themselves in Canada access our health care system in Canada and that\u2019s certainly something that will continue,\u201dHowever the cost, the need to travel and to have a passport make that prohibitive for some Americans. The ruling is likely to lead to abortion bans in roughly half of American states. Thirteen states, mainly in the South and Midwest, already had laws to ban abortion in the event Roe was overturned. Another half-dozen states have near-total bans or prohibitions after six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. Trudeau vowed to continue to stand up for woman\u2019s rights in the U.S. and elsewhere. \u201cWe have a commitment in Canada to ensure, first of all, that every women has full, safe legal access to the full suite of sexual health and reproductive services, including safe and legal abortions and we\u2019ve been working hard to increase access to women across the country,\u201d Trudeau said. \nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

I grabbed the back of the window to keep up with his car and tried to grab the steering wheel.

Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood on Friday.Molly Monk, a witness, told HuffPost that the man didn\u2019t give any audible indication that he was anti-abortion, \u201cbut he did go out of his way to hit protesters in the street who had very visible, very clear signs that they were pro-choice.\u201d \u201cIt makes me feel like the pro-life movement is a complete lie if, in order to be against people who are protesting for abortion rights, you try to murder them in my street, in my neighborhood,\u201d said Monk. \u201cIt makes me very, very sad, very hurt and very angry that this is what people think pro-life means.\u201dDespite recent calls from Republican lawmakers to protect their fellow abortion opponents from harm in the wake of Friday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling, the anti-abortion movement has a long history of violence.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Copy Chief, HuffPostReporter, HuffPostReporter, HuffPostThe Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood on Friday, dismantling the decades-old precedent that protected abortion rights and giving states the go-ahead to dramatically limit access to reproductive health care.The ruling in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization case, written by Justice Samuel Alito, was not a surprise. A draft ruling was leaked to Politico and published in early May; the final ruling hews closely to the leaked draft.\u201cWe hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,\u201d Alito wrote for the majority. \u201cThe Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional provision, including the one on which the defenders of Roe and Casey now chiefly rely\u2014the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d\u201cThat provision has been held to guarantee some rights that are not mentioned in the Constitution, but any such right must be \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition\u201d and \u201cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty,\u201d Alito continued.Abortion is not \u201cdeeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and tradition,\u201d according to Alito, and, therefore, not protected as a right.Alito was joined in his decision by Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a separate concurrence, while the liberal minority of Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor filed a joint dissent.The hard-line conservative ruling will now go nationwide, allowing states to implement strict abortion restrictions that will force some people to continue unwanted and unsafe pregnancies. Victims of rape and incest will, in some states, have to go through the traumas of pregnancy, birth and parenthood or adoption. Babies will be born with health conditions they suffer from and even quickly die from. People who aren\u2019t prepared or don\u2019t want to have children will have to have them anyway.The ruling does not end abortion rights entirely. Some states have vowed to protect abortion access and will likely become a safe haven for those seeking the procedure who are able to afford to travel. It\u2019s unclear how quickly the 22 states that already have laws limiting abortion will put their bans into effect, but some, including Missouri and Texas, acted quickly to enact their trigger bans in the wake of the ruling. And most state bans restrict abortion only after a certain point in a pregnancy, often with exceptions.However, that\u2019s not always the case. In Oklahoma, the GOP-controlled legislature passed a bill that would prohibit all abortions, except if the life of the pregnant person was in danger or if a rape had been reported to law enforcement. In other states, Republicans are increasingly pushing abortion restrictions that offer no exceptions for victims of rape or incest.And some efforts to enshrine abortion rights have failed. Senate Republicans blocked a bill to codify Roe v. Wade in May. The GOP holds an electoral advantage in many states due to district lines and electoral laws.The case came before the court as conservatives sensed momentum when former President Donald Trump, who promised to only appoint conservatives who would overturn Roe v. Wade, appointed three Supreme Court justices. One of those seats was filled by Trump only after Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) refused to allow then-President Barack Obama to appoint a justice to the seat left vacant by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death in 2016. The die was then cast after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death weeks before the 2020 election allowed Trump to appoint Barrett to give the conservatives a supermajority on the court.For this reason, Alito\u2019s majority did not need the vote of Roberts, who did not join the other conservative justices and filed a separate concurrence. In his concurrence, Roberts declared that Alito\u2019s opinion was wholly unnecessary to decide the case brought by Mississippi.\u201cSurely we should adhere closely to principles of judicial restraint, where the broader path the Court chooses entails repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of stare decisis\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cThe Court\u2019s opinion is thoughtful and thorough, but those virtues cannot compensate for the fact that its dramatic and consequential ruling is unnecessary to decide the case before us.\u201dThe liberal justices\u2019 joint dissent notes their \u201csorrow\u201d at the ruling and the pain and hardship it will bring to those now forced to bear children in the states where abortion is now illegal.\u201cWith sorrow\u2014for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection\u2014we dissent,\u201d they wrote. The liberals also noted that the judicial conservatives are not done stripping Americans of their hard-won rights.\u201c[The court\u2019s decision] eliminates a 50-year-old constitutional right that safeguards women\u2019s freedom and equal station,\u201d the liberal justices wrote. \u201cIt breaches a core rule-of-law principle, designed to promote constancy in the law. In doing all of that, it places in jeopardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex intimacy and marriage. And finally, it undermines the Court\u2019s legitimacy.\u201dIndeed, Justice Thomas declared in a separate concurrence that the majority opinion excising abortion from protection under the 14th Amendment\u2019s due process clause should be applied to the decisions that legalized contraception, same-sex marriage and same-sex sex.\u201c[I]n future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court\u2019s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,\u201d Thomas wrote.The deck is stacked against supporters of abortion rights. However, many advocacy groups were already planning next steps ahead of the ruling. Some are mobilizing to support people seeking abortions by funding travel to and care in states where the procedure remains legal. The governors of California, Oregon and Washington state announced a pact on Friday to allow patients from around the country to access abortion care in their states. Another option to protect access is medication abortion, which allows some people seeking to end their pregnancies to do so at home. State-level abortion bans have also targeted medication abortion, but advocates say it\u2019s likely more people will obtain the medication and manage their own abortions should bans go into effect.On the legislative front, advocates have called for the Senate to end the filibuster, a rule that requires 60 votes for most legislation \u2014 allowing the minority party to block bills, even if most senators support them. For now, ending the filibuster is unlikely: Two Senate Democrats, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, oppose ending it. Even if they changed their minds, Democrats likely only have 49 votes in favor of codifying Roe. In the most recent vote, Manchin sided with Republicans to block the bill.On Friday, Manchin lamented that he had \u201ctrusted\u201d Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, both of whom he voted to confirm, when they suggested they would not overturn Roe v. Wade. He added that he supports \u201clegislation that would codify the rights Roe v. Wade previously protected\u201d and hopes the two parties will work together on such a bill. But most Republicans \u2015 save similarly disappointed lawmakers like Sen. Susan Collins of Maine \u2015 are not interested in codifying abortion rights. On Friday, Republicans cheered the decision and indicated their next aim is to ban abortion across the country. President Joe Biden vowed on Friday to fight to protect abortion access, including by directing officials to ensure broader access to abortion pills and to protect people\u2019s ability to travel to seek an abortion. But he said that actually codifying abortion rights into law would take Congress \u2015 meaning voters need to expand Democratic majorities. \u201cThis decision must not be the final word,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis fall, Roe is on the ballot. Personal freedoms are on the ballot. The right to privacy, liberty, equality \u2015 they\u2019re all on the ballot.\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said on CNN Friday that Biden \u201cneeds to pick up every tool available to him and use it to protect access to abortion.\u201dShe encouraged supporters of abortion rights to keep fighting.\u201cWe are not without actions that we can take,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe need to have hope, but we need to hang on to this anger because we can use that anger to fuel change.\u201dCopy Chief, HuffPostReporter, HuffPostReporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPostWashington Bureau Chief, HuffPostIf Clarence Thomas gets his way, abortion rights are only the beginning of what should fall. The conservative Supreme Court justice wrote a concurring opinion Friday in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization ruling, which overturns Americans\u2019 constitutional right to an abortion. Thomas said justices should also reconsider other cases that rest on the right to privacy \u2014 specifically cases protecting contraception access and same-sex relationships.\u201cIn future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court\u2019s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell,\u201d Thomas wrote.These cases have long been in the crosshairs for conservatives, who mock the idea that there\u2019s a constitutional right to privacy. Yet in his opinion for the majority Friday, Justice Samuel Alito said the Dobbs outcome absolutely does not mean that conservatives want to go after those decisions. He even mocked the liberal justices\u2019 dissent for drawing comparisons between \u201cthe abortion right and the rights recognized in Griswold (contraception), Eisenstadt (same), Lawrence (sexual conduct with member of the same sex), and Obergefell (same-sex marriage).\u201d\u201cPerhaps this is designed to stoke unfounded fear that our decision will imperil those other rights,\u201d he added. But as Thomas\u2019 concurrence makes clear, that fear is very grounded in reality.Jim Obergefell, the lead plaintiff in the same-sex marriage case and currently a candidate for the Ohio statehouse, sharply criticized Thomas and his comments about marriage equality.\u201cClarence Thomas is a Supreme Court justice appointed by humans, he is not the Supreme Deity,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe millions of loving couples who have the right to marriage equality to form their own families do not need Clarence Thomas imposing his individual twisted morality upon them. If you want to see an error in judgment, Clarence Thomas, look in the mirror.\u201dAlready, a number of Republican politicians are going down the same path as Thomas, saying they\u2019d like to see cases like Griswold and Obergefell overturned, and considering legislation that could lead to contraception bans or restrictions.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Political Reporter, HuffPostRepublicans made clear following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision striking down abortion rights that they won\u2019t stop there: They want to ban abortion nationwide.\u201cHaving been given this second chance for Life, we must not rest and must not relent until the sanctity of life is restored to the center of American law in every state in the land,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said in a statement praising the court\u2019s decision on Friday.The ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization does not ban abortion nationally, though it does trigger laws banning or severely restricting abortions in more than 20 Republican-leaning states. A number of blue states, including Massachusetts, California and Illinois, have passed legislation protecting abortion rights. Republicans and anti-choice activists, however, are making it clear they plan on forcing even those states to ban abortion, either through state-by-state campaigns or a federal law banning the procedure. \u201cThe pro-life movement\u2019s work has just begun,\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said in a statement praising the ruling. \u201cThis issue will now be debated in the 50 states, and a 330,000,000-person, continental nation will work through this debate in a way that\u2019s healthier than Roe\u2019s one-size-fits-all, Washington-centrism.\u201dPassing a national abortion ban would be politically difficult, but not impossible. Republicans would need to win control of the presidency, the House and large enough majorities in the Senate to either eliminate the filibuster or bypass its 60-vote requirement. (The last requirement is made easier by the Senate\u2019s strong bias towards rural voters, who make up a key part of the GOP base.)Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), for one, allowed that a national abortion ban was \u201cpossible\u201d after the initial leak of the Supreme Court\u2019s draft decision. Last week, Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.) he would back a federal ban because \u201cany of us that believe this is wrong, it\u2019s wrong, period.\u201dSome Republican senators and anti-choice activists have begun drafting legislation for a six-week abortion ban.Such a ban would be unpopular: Just 37% of Americans believe abortion should be illegal most or all of the time, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told CNN Friday that he would back codifying a ban on abortions after 15 weeks, which is likely not as far as other members of his party would like to go. Democratic leaders are playing up the threat of a ban.\u201cRepublicans are plotting a nationwide abortion ban,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Friday morning. \u201cThey cannot be allowed to have a majority in the Congress to do that.\u201d Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) boasted Wednesday that she told a reporter to \u201cgo back to your country\u201d after being asked about the disparity in gun violence between the U.S. and the U.K.\u201cWe don\u2019t have guns in the U.K., that is true, but we don\u2019t have mass shootings either,\u201d a woman, whose identity was unclear, asked Greene at a press conference, according to a clip the congresswoman posted to Twitter. \u201cChildren aren\u2019t scared to go to school.\u201dGreene, flanked by other pro-gun House Republicans, including Reps.

Globally, firearms accounted for 54% of all homicides in 2017 while knives accounted for 22%, per a United Nations Global Study on Homicide.The gun death rate in the U.S. is substantially higher than any other developed nation, most of which have stricter gun control laws. In the past few years, England, Scotland and Wales combined have seen around 30 gun deaths a year. Comparatively, the number of murders involving firearms in the U.S. in 2020 was 19,384.Greene and many of her House GOP colleagues have criticized a bipartisan gun bill which on Tuesday cleared an initial hurdle to passing in the Senate, breaking a decades-long stalemate on gun control legislation. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act would expand background checks and direct millions of dollars toward helping states enact red-flag laws, which allow authorities to temporarily confiscate firearms from individuals deemed dangerous to themselves or others.A group of 14 Republicans, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Sens. John Cornyn (Texas), Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and Mitt Romney (Utah), voted to proceed with the bill.Greene listed the names of these senators during her press conference, declaring them the elected Republicans that \u201cRepublican voters do not support anymore.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve gotta change our Republican Party,\u201d she said.However, polling has repeatedly shown that a majority of voters, including Republicans and gun owners, support background checks and red flag laws.Senior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPostThere are 50 states in the United States of America. But in an interview Tuesday, Georgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker said there were 52. Walker was going after Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate for governor, for recently saying, \u201cI am tired of hearing about [Georgia] being the best state in the country to do business when we are the worst state in the country to live.\u201dAbrams cited the state\u2019s problems with mental health treatment, maternal mortality, incarceration rates and wages. Republicans seized upon the remark and used it to criticize her, although Abrams said she stood by her belief that Republican Brian Kemp is \u201ca failed governor, who doesn\u2019t care about the people of Georgia.\u201d In an interview Tuesday with the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, Walker said Abrams should go live in another state \u2015 saying she had 51 others from which to choose. \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in the country, leave and go somewhere else,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s the worst state, why are you here?

Walker is a former NFL star whose campaign has been filled with controversies and misstatements. He has faced domestic violence allegations, and recently, claims of being an absent father. Walker has talked frequently about his 22-year-old son Christian and railed against fatherless homes. But The Daily Beast reported that Walker actually has three other children he doesn\u2019t talk about publicly. He has since acknowledged his four children, saying he \u201cnever denied any of my kids.\u201dWalker has also said he\u2019s skeptical of evolution, pointing to the fact that apes and humans coexist.\u201cAt one time, science said man came from apes, did it not? ...

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostSenior Reporter, HuffPostThe House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol attack held its fourth public hearing Tuesday, this time focusing on the intense pressure campaign led by former President Donald Trump as he scrambled to overturn the results of the 2020 election.Through live and recorded testimony, text messages, video and audio segments, the panel showed how the effort to keep Trump in power for another four years was extensive and unrelenting. Trump\u2019s team took particular aim at fellow Republicans in swing states who might have been in positions to sway the final outcome, either by falsely revising the final tallies, meddling with the Electoral College or saying evidence of fraud had been found. But there was zero evidence of election fraud on a scale that could have affected the results. Fueled by the wrath of his supporters, Trump\u2019s anger at having lost the election put him on a direct path to lighting the spark that ignited on Jan. 6, 2021, with the deadly attack on the Capitol building, according to the committee.Here are seven of the the biggest takeaways.The committee presented evidence showing how Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis aggressively lobbied officials in swing states, including Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Georgia, to help them try to overturn the election results.In audio clips played at the hearing, Giuliani and Ellis can be heard calling Bryan Cutler, the Republican speaker of Pennsylvania\u2019s state House of Representatives, several days in a row in late November. \u201cI really have something important to call to your attention that I think really changes things,\u201d Giuliani said in one call. According to the committee, Cutler found this inappropriate and directed his lawyers to tell Giuliani to stop calling, but Giuliani would not back down. Russel \u201cRusty\u201d Bowers, the Republican speaker of Arizona\u2019s state House of Representatives, said the pair put similar pressure on him. He recalled Giuliani telling him, \u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of theories. We just don\u2019t have the evidence.\u201d The lawyers offered to provide evidence, Bowers testified, but never did. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, testified that his office tirelessly pursued allegations of election fraud, opening nearly 300 separate investigations, but came up empty. In one case, Trump\u2019s team claimed that 66,000 underage voters were counted, but Raffensperger\u2019s office found no evidence to back it up. \u201cThe numbers are the numbers. We investigated every allegation,\u201d Raffensperger testified. He said his team \u201cran down the rabbit trail to make sure our numbers were accurate.\u201d Trump had infamously told the Georgia official he needed to \u201cfind\u201d just enough votes for Trump to win the state. On Tuesday, Raffensperger testified: \u201cWhat I knew is we didn\u2019t have any votes to find. There were no votes to find.\u201dRuby Freeman, who said she used to go by Lady Ruby, was a poll worker in Georgia during the 2020 election. She and her daughter, Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss, found themselves personally attacked by Trump and his supporters in the wake of the election as Trump repeatedly fueled the idea that the vote had been rigged against him. Moss testified with her mother sitting behind her. Portions of Freeman\u2019s videotaped testimony were also played at the hearing. The women said their lives had been upended by abuse that came online and in person after Giuliani shared security camera footage of the pair counting ballots. Trump\u2019s team accused the women of counting \u201csuitcases\u201d of fake ballots that favored Biden. \u201cNowhere. There is nowhere I feel safe. Do you know how it feels to have the president of the United States target you? The president of the United States is supposed to represent every American, not to target one,\u201d Freeman said in her recorded testimony. She left her home for two months in early 2021 amid the harassment, which included death threats. Freeman added: \u201cBut he targeted me, Lady Ruby. A proud American citizen who stood up to help Fulton County run an election in the middle of a pandemic.\u201dMoss said she felt guilty for exposing her family to so much hate: \u201cI felt bad for picking this job, for always being the one who wants to help.\u201dShe also cleared up an accusation Giuliani made that she and Freeman were passing a USB drive back and forth while working. It was nothing but a ginger mint, she said. Michigan\u2019s state Senate majority leader, Mike Shirkey, a Republican, said that after Trump publicly shared his phone number, he received around 4,000 text messages. Bowers said his office in Arizona was inundated with phone calls, emails and text messages from Trump supporters, making it hard for his staff to communicate with one another.The pressure on Bowers led to personal attacks at his home, where his adult daughter was dying of a chronic illness. During his testimony, Gabriel Sterling, Georgia\u2019s voter system implementation manager, was asked about angry and impassioned remarks he made before the attack on the Capitol, warning that somebody was going to get hurt if the personal attacks on his colleagues didn\u2019t stop. The Republican official said the \u201cstraw that broke the camel\u2019s back\u201d came after Trump supporters began targeting a contractor who worked for Dominion Voting Systems. Someone Sterling normally regarded as \u201cpretty unflappable\u201d called to tell him about it. \u201cI did pull up Twitter. I scroll through it, and there\u2019s a particular tweet,\u201d Sterling testified. \u201cIt had his name, \u2018You\u2019ve committed treason. May God have mercy on your soul.\u2019 And a slowly twisting GIF of a noose.\u201d The attackers also turned to Raffensperger. He testified that Trump supporters threatened his wife with sexual violence and that some had broken into the home of his daughter-in-law, a widow with two children.Bowers refuted a statement Trump sent Tuesday just before the hearing began in which he claimed the Arizona lawmaker told him he supported the idea that the 2020 presidential election had been \u201cstolen.\u201d\u201cI did have a conversation with the president, but that certainly isn\u2019t it,\u201d Bowers testified, adding he never called it a rigged election to \u201canyone, anywhere, anytime.\u201d Trump claimed the opposite in his statement, writing that Bowers \u201ctold me that the election was rigged and that I won Arizona.\u201d John Eastman, a lawyer for Trump, told Bowers to just hold a vote to decertify Arizona\u2019s electors \u201cand let the courts sort it out.\u201d Bowers testified that he replied: \u201cYou are asking me to do something that\u2019s never been done in the history of the United States.\u201dBowers also testified that Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) called him the morning of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol while a joint session of Congress met to count the electoral votes.\u201cHe asked if I would sign on both to a letter that had been sent from my state and/or that I would support a decertification of the electors, and I said I would not,\u201d Bowers said of his conversation with Biggs. Other witnesses have told the committee Biggs was closely involved in planning the rally that led to the Capitol riot.Damning text messages displayed at the hearing revealed that, shortly before Vice President Mike Pence was scheduled to certify the election results, Johnson aide Sean Riley contacted Pence staffer Chris Hodgson to say the senator wanted to \u201chand\u201d Pence an \u201calternate slate of electors for [Michigan] and [Wisconsin] because the archivist didn\u2019t receive them.\u201dHodgson responded: \u201cDo not give that to him.\u201dA representative of Johnson, who is running for reelection in Wisconsin, issued a statement Tuesday saying the senator \u201chad no involvement in the creation of an alternate slate of electors and had no foreknowledge that it was going to be delivered to our office.

The legendary artist, who set the industry standard for surprise album releases in the 2010s, stunned audiences with the tune, which is quite different from the songs the award-winning vocalist usually bellows out.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPostGinni Thomas, the wife of conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, reportedly attended a meeting of a group involved in spreading election lies two months after a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.Thomas attended a group meeting headlined by pastor and conservative radio host C.L. Bryant on March 6, 2021, in which Bryant openly questioned President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election win, according to a video recording of the event reviewed by The Washington Post.\u201cThere is a robbery that is going on in this country right now,\u201d Bryant said at the Frontliners for Liberty event. \u201cIn fact, I say it to you and I\u2019ll say it loud and clear, and I\u2019m not ashamed to say it. I won\u2019t bite my tongue. I do believe that Donald John Trump is the only legitimate president.\u201dThe Post also said a photo from that meeting shows Thomas posing with Bryant.In December 2020, Thomas invited John Eastman, a lawyer advising former President Donald Trump on his efforts to overturn the election, to speak before the same group to provide \u201can update about election litigation to a group she met with periodically,\u201d Eastman wrote on his Substack, attaching a copy of the email Thomas sent to him.The Post spoke to members of Frontliners for Liberty who described the group as a \u201cloose-knit coalition of conservative activists\u201d that is confidential.Last week, the Post reported the House panel was in possession of emails exchanged between the two, citing sources saying the correspondence was evidence that Thomas was more involved than previously known in interfering with the election results.This prompted the committee to send an invitation to Thomas to testify, Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) told reporters Thursday.The email Eastman published appears to be part of the 170 documents a California judge ordered the lawyer to turn over to the committee, including 10 documents that the judge wrote were related to three meetings held in December 2020 by a group supporting Trump, according to NBC News.\u201cFour documents pertain to a meeting on Dec. 8, 2020: two emails are the group\u2019s high-profile leader inviting Dr. Eastman to speak at the meeting, and two contain the meeting\u2019s agenda,\u201d U.S. District Judge David Carter said.Carter ruled the House panel \u201chas a substantial interest in these three meetings because the presentations furthered a critical objective of the January 6 plan: to have contested states certify alternate slates of electors for President Trump.\u201dThe communications between Thomas and Eastman also point out a direct conflict of interest for her husband, who did not recuse himself from cases related to the Capitol riot.Justice Clarence Thomas was the only dissent in a case before the court involving claims of executive privilege by Trump and some of his officials about documents requested by the Jan. 6 committee. Among those officials was Mark Meadows, with whom Ginni Thomas exchanged text messages urging him to continue fighting the election result.Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-N.J.) on Thursday called on Clarence Thomas to resign following reports on his wife\u2019s conduct.\u201cAnd while she was doing all this, her husband, Justice Clarence Thomas, was hearing litigation relating to the 2020 election,\u201d Pascrell wrote, calling Thomas \u201ca corrupt jurist who has poisoned the High Court.\u201dEastman, who clerked for Clarence Thomas, strongly denies having any conversations with Ginni Thomas about Supreme Court cases.\u201cI can categorically confirm that at no time did I discuss with Mrs. Thomas or Justice Thomas any matters pending or likely to come before the Court,\u201d Eastman wrote on his Substack. \u201cWe have never engaged in such discussions, would not engage in such discussions, and did not do so in December 2020 or anytime else.\u201dIn an interview with Washington Free Beacon in March, Ginni Thomas said she does not interfere with her husband\u2019s work on the court. \u201cClarence doesn\u2019t discuss his work with me, and I don\u2019t involve him in my work,\u201d she said.Eastman was also the subject of the committee\u2019s third public hearing, which showed he was involved in crafting a fake electors scheme that would block Biden\u2019s win, even though he knew it was illegal.Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A settlement agreement has been reached on the eve of a second trial pitting the Kardashian family against former reality TV star Blac Chyna. Jury selection had been set to begin Monday in the trial over Chyna's allegations that her former fiance Rob Kardashian maliciously posted nude photos of her in 2017 after their tumultuous breakup, but according to court documents, the parties informed the judge that they had agreed to a settlement.Emails to attorneys for both sides seeking comment and details on the terms of the settlement were not immediately returned.A trial had seemed a virtual certainty after the judge last week denied a motion by Kardashian's attorneys to enforce a settlement agreement they said the two sides had reached. The trial was to be a sequel of sorts to a defamation trial earlier this year in which Chyna, whose legal name is Angela White, alleged that Kardashian's mother and sisters \u2014 Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kylie Jenner \u2014 had defamed her as violent and unstable, and persuaded producers and executives to cancel her reality show, \u201cRob & Chyna.\u201dThe Kardashians won a clear-cut victory in that trial May 2. The four women had attended most of the proceedings, and all four testified, though they were in New York at the Met Gala when the verdict was read. Rob Kardashian, who has a daughter with Chyna, was not a defendant in that trial, but he gave often angry and sometimes sad testimony about the late-night fight that led to the end of their relationship.Chyna had initially filed one lawsuit against the whole family, but the judge ruled that the allegations against Rob \u2014 which also included assault accusations \u2014 should get their own trial. Fewer members of the famous family had been expected to attend the second trial, and only Rob and Kris Kardashian had been expected to testify. At the first trial, jurors found that the Kardashians acted in bad faith in their conversations about the couple's troubles with producers of \u201cRob & Chyna\u201d and executives from the E! network, which aired it. But they found that it had no substantial effect on Chyna\u2019s contract or the fate of the show, and she was awarded no damages. Chyna\u2019s attorney Lynne Ciani said after the verdict that she and her client were disappointed but felt vindicated by the jury's findings, which she said demonstrated that Chyna had not physically abused Rob, and validated their claim that the Kardashian women had attempted to interfere with her contract to be on the show. ___Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdaltonBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The theater will instead be called the Theater for Artistic Freedom and Expression.Chappelle said during the ceremony that he declined the honor because he did not want his name to distract from students\u2019 work. The Duke Ellington School of the Arts decided to rename the theater after Chappelle last year and scheduled a fundraiser in November. But the school postponed the event after controversy escalated following Chappelle\u2019s Netflix special \u201cThe Closer,\u201d which included graphic jokes about transgender women and the LGBTQ community. Chappelle in November urged people in an Instagram post to donate to the school regardless of whether they agree with his name on the theater.A post shared by Dave Chappelle (@davechappelle)\u201cThe Duke Ellington school is a glorious institution. Within those walls I found a context to explore my creativity seriously,\u201d Chappelle wrote, adding: \u201cMy only intent is to insure Duke Ellington the opportunity to train its artists unfettered.\u201d The Netflix special sparked a storm of controversy over Chappelle\u2019s comments about the trans community.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Trends Reporter, HuffPostFormer President Donald Trump continues to push for single-day, in-person voting in elections \u2014 prohibiting mail-in ballots and early voting that 69% of American voters used in 2020.Despite the risk of slashing voter rolls by making casting a ballot far more difficult, Trump called last week at a Nashville convention for \u201csame-day voting.\u201d\u201cUltimately, we want same-day voting \u2014 one day \u2014 and only paper ballots,\u201d Trump said to cheers.Trump has justified the GOP push for more difficult and restrictive voting by claiming it will protect against the kind of rigged election he insists occurred in 2020 \u2014 which has proven to be a lie. Ironically, Trump, who has baselessly claimed mail ballots are \u201ccorrupt,\u201d votes by mail.\u201cUltimately, we want same day voting. One day!\u201d pic.twitter.com/KiTUrxNArCCritics say Trump\u2019s goal is to significantly decrease the number of votes, which is generally considered beneficial to Republicans. One user on Twitter quipped that Trump is running on a platform urging: \u201cDon\u2019t count all the votes.\u201dTrump said on Fox News in 2020 that \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u201d if \u201cvoting levels\u201d were expanded. (Research has shown, however, that mail-in ballots don\u2019t appear to give either party a distinct advantage.)Witnesses who testified at last week\u2019s hearings before the House select committee investigating the insurrection, said that Trump wanted to shut down voting and not count anymore ballots while he was still ahead on election night. He tweeted the following morning: \u201cStop the count!\u201dBut that\u2019s not the way elections work.Former Fox News political editor Chris Stirewalt testified about the \u201cred mirage\u201d when Republicans tend to be ahead in the evening of an election day before late and mail-in votes are counted, and catch up to, and often surpass, the early leaders.Trump, however, declared that night before all the votes were tallied: \u201cFrankly, we did win this election.\u201dStepien in his deposition said Trump disagreed with his election night advice that he not declare victory. Trump then gave a speech where he said \"this is a fraud on the American public ... frankly we did win this election\" pic.twitter.com/s7eplwoOO1The U.S. Census Department reported that in the 2020 election 69% of American voters nationwide cast their ballot \u201cnontraditionally\u201d \u2014 by mail and/or before Election Day.Early and mail-in voting have tremendously increased the convenience of casting a ballot, allowing and encouraging more people to vote. For example, homebound and bed-ridden citizens can now easily vote by mail.Early voting and mail-in ballots also aid people who work long hours or multiple jobs, or are juggling child care and are not able to get to polling spots before they close. Many employers don\u2019t allow extra time to vote. Voters also no longer have to drive long distances to rural polling places on one particular day.Trump\u2019s plan completely overlooks Americans abroad, including employees working overseas, service members and staff of diplomatic postings, who mail in their ballots.Critics on Twitter weren\u2019t keen on Trump\u2019s plot to make voting onerous. Nope.Ummmm lol...\"But only for the rich who can afford to take the day off to go vote, because we sure as hell aren't going to make Election Day a holiday.\"In my experience as a pollworker? In person Election Day voting is overwhelmingly old white folks.So Trump doesn't want most of the military to vote?

In a recorded call from Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ahead of the official 2020 vote certification, Trump told the election official to \u201cfind\u201d the 11,780 votes needed to reverse his loss to Joe Biden in the state. Akerman, who served as an assistant special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal that led to the resignation of former President Richard Nixon, said he believed that tape would be enough to lead to a possible conviction.\u201cIf you are asking which of the cases right now, which one is going to send Donald Trump to prison, that is the case,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a really neat three-year felony in Georgia, that Donald Trump has violated.

Georgia state law also makes it a crime to willfully tamper with \u201cany electors list, voter\u2019s certificate, numbered list of voters, ballot box, voting machine, direct recording electronic (DRE) equipment, or tabulating machine\u201d or to solicit another person to commit such a felony, punishable by a sentence of up to three years in prison.Trump\u2019s only potential defense would be to \u201csomehow pick up on some ambiguity in the tape, that he did not really mean what he said,\u201d Akerman noted, though he doesn\u2019t think that will stand up.\u201cPut in the context about the January 6th committee has found, I think they have gotten a case beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d he said.The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol has laid out damning evidence from thousands of hours of testimony and tens of thousands of pages of documents in hearings this month that create a picture of how Trump and his allies spread falsehoods about the 2020 election and tried to overturn the results despite knowing the accusations were untrue.Trump has argued his conversation with Raffensperger was \u201cPERFECT and appropriate.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior National Correspondent, HuffPostA few months after Massachusetts became the first state to recognize same-sex marriage, a college senior in Michigan wrote an essay on why his church should do the same. In 2004, Joseph Kuilema was getting ready to graduate from Calvin College, an affiliate of the U.S. Christian Reformed Church that is based in Grand Rapids and has a few hundred thousand followers scattered mostly across the Upper Midwest. The CRC is a Protestant denomination that sees the Bible as \u201cinspired and infallible\u201d truth, while drawing upon three Reformation-era texts called \u201cconfessions\u201d to explain what that truth means in real life. Among the lessons the CRC takes from these writings is its position on same-sex relationships. The CRC promotes love for gay members, calling past hostility toward the LGBTQ community \u201ca great failing.\u201d But it also deems homosexual behavior \u201cincompatible\u201d with Scripture because, in the church\u2019s view, intimacy is a divine gift reserved for marriage between a man and a woman.The CRC first staked out that position in 1973. Kuilema, writing three decades later, explained why he thought it was wrong. In a paper that he called \u201cTuxes for Two\u201d and submitted for a course on theological ethics, Kuilema highlighted what he saw as inconsistencies in CRC doctrine and argued for interpreting religious texts in the context of their times, which, he said, meant focusing on the nature of the loving, lifelong partnership the Bible celebrates rather than whether it is between a man and woman. \u201cThis is about \u2026 couples who are in love, devoted to God and the Christian faith, ready to embark on a lifelong journey of commitment and mutuality,\u201d Kuilema wrote.Aggressively interrogating such widely accepted principles of faith would have qualified as rebellion at many Christian colleges. At Calvin, it was a tradition, with students following a tone set by the faculty. School policies explicitly allowed professors room to criticize elements of CRC orthodoxy as long as they agreed to conduct their lives according to the church\u2019s rules. And in a long-running internal CRC debate over how to temper biblical writings with contemporary values, Calvin faculty were frequently among those pushing hardest for more progressive views.That environment is one reason that Kuilema returned to Calvin several years after graduation, to become a tenure-track professor in the social work department. As a researcher, he focused on the intersections between faith and activism. As a teacher, he directed study abroad programs in Liberia. He liked to speak out on issues related to race, once drawing the scorn of Tucker Carlson\u2019s website, and became a visible ally to Calvin\u2019s LGBTQ students, one of whom later came to him with a request. Nicole Sweda had gotten to know Kuilema when she was an openly queer undergraduate and had kept in touch with him afterward, when she got a full-time job at a research center that operated within the school. She was getting ready to wed her longtime girlfriend, and the two were hoping Kuilema could officiate the ceremony. Kuilema agreed, reasoning that it would be compliant with Calvin faculty rules because he wasn\u2019t the one getting married \u2015 and because the ceremony would be secular and on his own time. He checked with the elders at his Grand Rapids church, which is part of the CRC, as well as his department chair at Calvin. They said they were fine with it.But Kuilema had run afoul of Calvin officials before. In 2018, the Board of Trustees overruled a faculty recommendation and blocked his tenure, citing concerns over the \u201ctone and substance\u201d of past statements about the LGBTQ community. Kuilema had remained at Calvin afterward, working on a two-year renewable contract that was serving as a probationary period. Presiding at the wedding risked drawing more official ire. At the same time, Kuilema thought, there was a higher authority to consider \u2015 and more important imperatives to follow. \u201cFor me, the religious question was not whether God approves of such unions, I think God absolutely does, but whether I would be faithful to God,\u201d Kuilema told me recently, thinking back to why he decided to go ahead. \u201cThe question was whether I would practice what I preach and be willing to accept whatever consequences that might follow.\u201dThose consequences would soon become clear \u2015 and upend his life. In early December, about two months after the wedding and just as Kuilema\u2019s newest reappointment was on the verge of approval, he was summoned to a meeting with the provost, Noah Toly. Somebody had sent Toly a photo of Kuilema officiating the wedding. When Kuilema confirmed that the image was authentic, he learned that his reappointment was on hold, pending a fuller investigation and discussion of whether that should affect his contract status.Kuilema wasn\u2019t the only one facing consequences. In January, Sweda got a calendar invite for her own meeting with Toly, whom she had never met. There, Sweda told me later, officials asked her to verify her relationship status and told her that she was in violation of Calvin guidelines. Sweda said she hadn\u2019t known the rules for staff prohibited same-sex relationships, then she asked nervously, \u201cAm I being fired?\u201dAfter a few more weeks, and while administrators were still weighing their options, a reporter for the student newspaper, Chimes, broke the story of Kuilema, the wedding and the possibility of employment repercussions, instantly turning the private matter into a public controversy and exposing deep rifts in the Calvin community over not just the fate of a student and beloved professor, but also the future of the institution itself. The story has since gone national, with coverage in several religion and higher-education publications.The controversy at Calvin has a lot in common with disputes elsewhere in the U.S., including an ongoing fight over anti-gay hiring policies that has divided students, faculty and trustees at Seattle Pacific University, a medium-sized Christian college, as well as a possible split of the United Methodist Church into two denominations, one recognizing same-sex marriage and one continuing to reject it.And there are echoes of fights playing out in other contexts, including the political debates over classroom discussion of sexual orientation in Florida and over transgender athletes competing in collegiate sports. The same underlying tensions are also at the heart of a lawsuit, pending in federal court, over a special exemption that allows religious schools to collect federal education funds even if they have policies that discriminate against LGBTQ students or faculty.The thread running through all these controversies is a clash between the traditional and the modern \u2015 between those who think their worlds have already changed too much and those who want them to change more \u2015 over a whole set of cultural issues but especially over those related to sexuality. And at Calvin, it\u2019s fast becoming an existential crisis, with newer generations of students and many faculty pushing the school to accept and embrace the LBGTQ community more firmly while outside forces pull in the opposite direction. Among those outside forces are some wealthy donors and alumni, including at least one with ties to the DeVos-Prince family, one of the most influential financiers of conservative politics in the U.S. Another source of pressure are parents of Calvin students, specifically the ones who expect the school to shield their kids from a culture they believe promotes LGBTQ behavior. Then there\u2019s the CRC itself, whose governing congress, the Synod, this week voted to elevate its position on LGBTQ matters from \u201cpastoral guidance\u201d (which effectively allows some room for questioning and dissent) to \u201cconfessional\u201d status (which doesn't). A number of Calvin professors have already threatened to leave if the vote leads to change in school policies.In the past, Calvin\u2019s leaders have frequently tried to find a middle ground on issues related to sexuality by talking up academic freedom even as they pledged fealty to biblical authority, and by preaching love even as their policies condemned the behavior of LGBTQ students. Today that middle ground feels less stable than ever. Many in and around Calvin wonder how much longer it can hold and fear what the school will become if it doesn\u2019t.The first time I met Joe Kuilema was in early May, at a coffee shop about two miles from campus. He is tall and slender, with a full beard and bald head, and as he sat across from me in a booth to tell his story, he talked with an animated enthusiasm that made it easy to understand why undergraduates voted him \u201cteacher of the year\u201d in 2019. The eatery had a hipster feel, with exposed brick walls, hardwood floors and industrial track lighting. Nothing about the scene would have felt out of place in Cambridge or Berkeley, or in Ann Arbor, for that matter, although there are reasons that Kuilema\u2019s academic trajectory took him instead to Grand Rapids \u2014 and to Calvin. One of those reasons is faith. Another is family. Kuilema\u2019s lineage traces back to the Dutch immigrants who settled in western Michigan in the 19th and early 20th centuries and today remain a dominant presence in that part of the state. The first wave established the CRC to carry on the traditions of the churches they had known in the Netherlands and established a Calvin seminary to train clergy who could lead services in their native language. Later, school administrators broadened the academic mission and spun off the non-ministerial division, which became Calvin College \u2015 and more recently, Calvin University \u2015 although the close relationship to the CRC remained. To this day, the church has direct governing responsibility over the college, plus it supplies a portion of the operating budget. But historically Calvin administrators haven\u2019t tried to wall the school off from the outside world in the way some other Christian colleges have \u2015 which is why, in the late 1960s, some of the turmoil that was roiling the rest of America seeped into the Calvin campus. Among those caught up in it were Kuilema\u2019s parents, who met when they were both undergraduates and whom Kuilema described as \u201clong-haired hippies.\u201d His father once helped produce a spoof of the official CRC newspaper that featured a drawing of the famous Iwo Jima flag-raising but with a giant dollar bill instead of the Stars and Stripes on the pole. Several years and a few haircuts later, Kuilema\u2019s father came back to Calvin as an employee, serving in a variety of high-ranking administrative roles. But neither he nor Kuilema\u2019s mother ever stopped pushing for change \u2015 in the world, in the church or on campus. One of Kuilema\u2019s most vivid childhood memories is from 1990, when he would have been 8 years old, and his mother was participating in a demonstration to protest the CRC\u2019s traditional prohibition on women holding leadership roles in churches. Kuilema and his two sisters went along, sitting in delegate chairs, holding lighted candles and singing along with the protest chants.Years later, the CRC\u2019s Synod officially adopted a new position that gave individual churches discretion over whether to accept women leaders, though it would take 12 more years before they let women vote on denominational decisions. Kuilema says that watching his parents made a big impression and led directly to his professional choices.\u201cMy father\u2019s trajectory from radical student protesting Vietnam and publishing subversive magazines to respected Calvin employee was part of what convinced me that there was room for someone like me at Calvin,\u201d he said. When Kuilema was getting ready to join the Calvin faculty, in 2008, he mentioned his belief that the CRC should support same-sex marriage. The dean responded by noting that many other Calvin professors felt the same way. Which wasn\u2019t surprising.A small but growing minority of religious scholars from across Christian faiths had been arguing that the anti-LGBTQ reading of Scripture was too literal and too selective. Several found a home at Calvin, where professors have long had license to engage in wide-ranging debates, even those touching directly on issues of faith. But professors also sign pledges to live by the CRC\u2019s rules for conduct. They aren\u2019t supposed to challenge the CRC\u2019s most fundamental beliefs. And although there\u2019s a lot of disagreement over exactly where that line is, sometimes professors have gotten into trouble because the administration believed they had crossed it. In 2009, a pair of religion professors published a paper stating that fossil records made it impossible to believe a biblical Adam and Eve had been exiled from a garden paradise, effectively calling into question the CRC\u2019s understanding of original sin. Among those who expressed outrage was Gaylen Byker, who was president of Calvin back then and also happened to be a prominent Republican Party donor. One of the paper co-authors ended up leaving, under undisclosed terms, prompting one school critic to write in the Chronicle of Education that the episode had \u201cstained\u201d Calvin\u2019s reputation.A major controversy over the treatment of the LGBTQ community had started just a few years before, over a play called \u201cSeven Passages\u201d that was about LGBTQ life in conservative Christian communities in the Midwest. The author was Stephanie Sandberg, a Calvin theater professor. She\u2019d gotten the idea for it after meeting with a distraught undergraduate who was afraid to tell his parents that he was gay. While working on it, she told me, she was careful to keep her faculty superiors informed of her work and to underwrite the project with independent funding. \u201cSeven Passages\u201d played to a month of sold-out shows at a Grand Rapids theater. Calvin faculty attended, including some who were also part of a panel on LGBTQ issues that Sandberg moderated on campus. A production company even decided to make a film version. But an outraged CRC pastor in Iowa wrote Calvin officials and the elders at Sandberg\u2019s Grand Rapids church, accusing her of violating church orthodoxy. The Board of Trustees responded with a statement saying that \u201cadvocacy of homosexual practice and same-sex marriage is not permitted\u201d \u2015 and stood by its pronouncement even after 36 to 4 vote in the Faculty Senate calling on the trustees to withdraw it. Over the next few years, a college working group produced a series of new guidelines for faculty behavior that made a point of recognizing the need for academic freedom. But it also called on professors to check in with their academic superiors whenever their work might question or undermine core CRC beliefs.It\u2019s impossible to understand the controversies at Calvin without recognizing how rapidly the world around it has changed and how threatening those changes feel to some parts of the school\u2019s community. Nicole Sweda has seen both parts of that story.She arrived for her first year in 2016. The U.S. Supreme Court had just made same-sex marriage the law of the land, with the public strongly approving. Car companies and other retailers were sponsoring Pride events and targeting gay customers with ads. It was no longer a big deal to see openly gay figures in business, politics or professional sports \u2015 and at Sweda\u2019s large public high school in Rochester Hills, an upscale Detroit suburb, it wasn\u2019t a big deal, either.\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t feel like anybody cared,\u201d Sweda told me. \u201cFreshman or sophomore year, you\u2019d sometimes hear people still say, \u2018That\u2019s so gay\u2019 or whatever, but by the end of high school, even that wasn\u2019t the case anymore. It was going out of style.\u201dSweda played bass and snare drum in the marching band and developed a relationship with Annica Steen, who played flute and who came out as queer later in high school. For college, Steen chose Grand Valley State University, a public institution just outside Grand Rapids with more than 20,000 students. Sweda opted for Calvin, which had only about 3,000 students and where two of her siblings had gone.Sweda knew that Calvin\u2019s code for students prohibited intimacy among same-sex couples as part of its demand for chastity outside of marriage. But during campus visits, she\u2019d seen students and instructors wearing pride buttons. She had also taken notice of Calvin\u2019s Sexuality and Gender Awareness (SAGA) peer support group, which it publicized on its website, and a speaker series on sexuality the university had sponsored. Other prospective students came to Calvin with similar impressions \u2015 among them, Lindsay Owens, who grew up in a conservative, rural Ohio town and who told me she felt out of place there because of her Mexican ethnicity as well as her sexual orientation. During high school, Owens had attended a summer program at Calvin for racial and ethnic minority students, led by progressive faculty and full of like-minded participants. When it came time to apply for college, she checked out Calvin and saw the SAGA web page. She also took note that the CRC\u2019s position didn\u2019t actually condemn people for being gay, only for acting on it.\u201cPeople on my Facebook page will talk about how it\u2019s a perversion or something like that, how it can be cured and all sorts of stuff,\u201d said Owens, who graduated this year. \u201cCalvin doesn\u2019t take that position. \u2026 They affirm that God loves you, you\u2019re fine the way you are. They say they just don\u2019t want you to act on it, and that automatically seems more welcoming to people who come from my background.\u201dBut once on campus, Owens and many other students felt as if Calvin\u2019s accommodations had limits. SAGA offered a \u201csafe space\u201d but wasn\u2019t able to operate as an advocacy organization, which it does on other campuses. Resident advisers believed they couldn\u2019t be in LGBTQ relationships, even celibate ones, making it difficult to accept a position that many of them needed to help pay their bills. The policies themselves are not so clear. In response to written questions, university spokesperson Matthew Kucinski confirmed that the school \u201cdiscouraged romantic same-sex dating relationships\u201d among resident advisers while adding that \u201cit\u2019s important to note that we\u2019ve never fired an RA for dating someone of the same gender.\u201d He stressed that Calvin is a \u201ccaring and diverse community\u201d and said the school has \u201cworked hard to help those within our community who identify as LGBTQ+ to feel a sense of belonging.\u201dBut to students like Owens, the school\u2019s message isn\u2019t ambiguous. \u201cThe supports Calvin does have are not like, \u2018Let\u2019s celebrate your being queer and let\u2019s celebrate your identity.\u2019 It\u2019s very much, \u2018Let\u2019s help you as you\u2019re struggling.\u2019 And that comes off very much like there\u2019s something wrong with you.\u201d Harm Venhuizen, the student journalist who broke the Kuilema story and graduated this spring, said he can understand how prospective students get the wrong impression. \u201cYou come to Calvin and you visit; you might be told there\u2019s an organization for gay students on campus, there are Pride flags around campus,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s something that exists at Calvin. But it\u2019s something that\u2019s bound, too \u2015 something that is restricted by policy and not as affirming as promotional materials might lead you to think.\u201dStudents weren\u2019t the only ones who felt disappointment. Julia Smith, who was on the Calvin staff and ran the sexuality speaker series from 2008 to 2019, said administrators routinely fielded angry feedback from parents and alumni that sometimes filtered down to her. In one instance, she said, \u201can influential person close to big money\u201d sent a long email full of \u201canti-trans talking points,\u201d pushing her to disinvite a gay speaker. Another time, she said, a manager arranged for a meeting with a parent who objected to the whole approach of exposing students to LGBTQ speakers. The parent wanted to know Smith\u2019s personal view on same-sex marriage. Smith said she refused to answer and feared that, if she had, she might have lost her job.\u201cThey affirm that God loves you, you\u2019re fine the way you are. They say they just don\u2019t want you to act on it, and that automatically seems more welcoming to people who come from my background.\u201dSexual orientation wasn\u2019t the underlying issue the first time Kuilema was part of a public controversy.A 2015 column he wrote about white privilege landed him on the \u201cProfessor Watchlist\u201d from the right-wing group Turning Point USA and made him the focus of an article in The Daily Caller, the conservative publication Tucker Carlson founded and was still editing at the time. (Headline: \u201cProfessor Blames White Privilege for the Existence of Michigan.\u201d)When the publicity led to a wave of angry emails and social media posts, including a few death threats, more than 100 of Kuilema\u2019s colleagues rallied to his defense with an open letter asking to be part of the same watchlist. It was testimony to the high regard he had among fellow scholars and the main reason he was optimistic about his chances for tenure in 2018, especially because he also had enthusiastic backing from his department and dean.Kuilema\u2019s final interview with the screening committee went so well that he wrote a Facebook post afterward thanking all of the people who had helped his career \u2015 and noting that he seemed likely to get tenure even though, as he admitted, he had gently poked the administration. The \u201cpoke\u201d he had in mind was yet another statement he\u2019d made, during the interview, about his feelings about the LGBTQ community and the church\u2019s posture toward it. He told me he mentioned it for the same reason he did when he first joined the faculty: He thought honesty demanded that he be upfront about his feelings.But Kuilema didn\u2019t get tenure. The Board of Trustees rejected the recommendations, and in a letter outlining its rationale cited a number of instances (including the Facebook post) when he\u2019d made public or private statements about LGBTQ issues. The letter noted the tradition of such dissent at Calvin but said it was important to express such disagreement with a \u201ctone\u201d and \u201cstrategy\u201d that was more respectful toward the CRC and its positions. \u201cThe Board needs more evidence that your communications, whether written or spoken, formal or informal, serve to strengthen the college and the broader Christian community in constructive and transparent ways,\u201d the letter said.Several professors later told Chimes that they could not recall another instance of the trustees overruling a screening committee recommendation, let alone one that was so strong and backed by so many members of the faculty. But instead of leaving, Kuilema took up the trustees\u2019 offer (which was itself unusual) to stay on at Calvin, with a two-year contract that could be renewed, in order to demonstrate that he could address their concerns. Kuilema took several steps, like taking care to recruit panelists who held the traditional position for an LGBTQ \u201cteach-in\u201d and giving plenty of emphasis to the CRC\u2019s position during a classroom lecture \u2015 so much so that a student complained it gave short shrift to the pain people experience when they must hide their identities. Kuilema also began working with Micah Watson, a politically conservative, Princeton-educated political scientist who believes the traditional CRC posture on LGBTQ issues represents the most honest reading of Scripture and the confessions.Watson bristles at the suggestion that the CRC (or Calvin) should \u201ccondemn\u201d people for what they feel or desire; in an interview, he said he hopes that both would continue to welcome members of the LGBTQ community. The goal, he said, should be to set clearer standards for behavior and then \u201cbe pastoral, understanding and grace-filled\u201d to \u201cthose of us who, for whatever reason, have a hard time living up to the standard.\u201d Kuilema said one reason he sought out Watson was that he wanted to demonstrate he could engage with such arguments and their advocates respectfully, which was something else the trustees had questioned. Kuilema told me later that the collaboration helped him sort out his own thoughts \u2015 and that he has enjoyed getting to know the more senior professor, whom he considers a friend. Watson said pretty much the same thing about Kuilema, describing him as intellectually serious, well-versed in Scripture and full of integrity.\u201cI like Joe,\u201d he said. On the day of the wedding, Kuilema said, he was calm for the first time in weeks.Early in his remarks, he followed the couple\u2019s request to memorialize their union as significant without turning the ceremony into a political statement. He mentioned the \u201cdifficult and painful decisions about who is safe to be open with\u201d that the two had frequently faced \u2015 and how, just a few years prior, \u201cwe would not have been able to stand here and legally marry you.\u201d Then he spoke about their relationship, echoing the sentiments of his old senior class paper and throwing in a corny joke about the two former marching band performers making music together.\u201cYou have built your relationship together, with few models for how to do so or what it might look like, and you have built something beautiful,\u201d Kuilema said.The ceremony went well, and so did the celebration, despite some morning rain and a lack of fall colors that Sweda and Steen had hoped for when they picked the October date. They danced to \u201cGolden Hour\u201d by Kacey Musgraves and managed to get a few bites of the beef tenderloin and goat cheese-stuffed mushrooms from the buffet. Sweda said she felt disappointed that one college friend had opted not to attend, apparently because the friend\u2019s husband objected to the ceremony on principle. But they still had about 150 guests, including some other Calvin faculty, alumni and students. \u201cThe overriding emotion was just joy,\u201d Kuilema said. \u201cIt was such a beautiful day.\u201dSweda and Steen told me they were careful when posting about the wedding on social media, consciously excluding photos of Kuilema presiding because they didn\u2019t want anybody to accuse him of using the wedding to make a public statement. To this day, neither they nor Kuilema knows who sent the image to Toly, the provost \u2015 and Toly wouldn\u2019t tell me.But when the summons to the meetings came, both Kuilema and Sweda knew something was amiss. Sweda told me she got even more scared when the other officials present began the meeting with a prayer, asking for God\u2019s help to give her peace. \u201cIt felt very ominous,\u201d Sweda said. It took a few weeks for administrators to sort out her situation. Eventually they cut ties with the research center where she worked, allowing it to operate independently. The decision took many faculty members by surprise, but it meant that the center was free of Calvin\u2019s personnel rules and Sweda could have a job. Kuilema wasn\u2019t so lucky. In April, he got a five-page, single-spaced memo from the dean, Benita Wolters-Fredlund, acknowledging his \u201cstellar record\u201d as a scholar, teacher and colleague, and quoting several professors who gushed at length about his work. But, Wolters-Fredlund explained, the decision to preside at the wedding and failure to consult anybody in the top echelons of campus governance was a \u201cserious lapse in judgment\u201d that threatened the university\u2019s integrity, especially given that Sweda was a Calvin employee.Because of this judgment lapse, Wolters-Fredlund said, the university was not renewing his contract. The memo made it clear that Kuilema could file an appeal, which he promptly set about doing, although he knew it meant winning over some of the same officials who had already ruled against him \u2015 and who were subject to pressures of their own.\u201cWe all at various points in our lives join communities or institutions that have rules or norms we wouldn\u2019t make ourselves.\u201dColleges around the country are about to hit a demographic cliff when the population of potential new first-year students will decline by as much as 15% \u2015 enough to threaten financial stability at all but the most elite, sought-after and generously funded schools. The situation is even more dire for colleges that draw heavily from the Midwest, because of out-migration. On top of that, Calvin is still recovering from a period of unrelated financial instability that led to buyouts, layoffs and eliminations of whole departments. One consequence of that pressure is that campus controversies can have serious fiscal implications, especially when they touch on hot-button political issues of interest to powerful alumni. A former Calvin official told me it was widely known that a number of major donors was angry and in some cases stopped providing contributions after all the national publicity about Claire Murashima, who in 2020 came out as Calvin\u2019s first openly queer student body president. Current Calvin officials wouldn\u2019t comment on that except to point out that donor reactions to news are common and run in both directions. But nationally, \u201cit\u2019s often the donors and conservative trustees who are opposed to full LGBTQ inclusion,\u201d according to Jonathan Coley, an Oklahoma State University sociologist and author of \u201cGay on God\u2019s Campus: Mobilizing for LGBT Equality at Christian Colleges and Universities.\u201d At Calvin, it\u2019s no secret that one high-profile university supporter, Allan Hoekstra, resigned from the Board of Trustees in 2020 at least partly because of the school\u2019s handling of LGBTQ students.Hoekstra is president of a real estate holding company in nearby Holland, Michigan. He is also a prominent figure in conservative circles with ties to the DeVos and Prince families, who together form one of the most powerful dynasties in national right-wing politics. (As of mid-2020, according to tax filings, Hoekstra was secretary/treasurer of the Edgar and Elsa Prince Foundation, which has in the past financed Focus on the Family, the Family Research Council and other organizations promoting a Christian conservative agenda.)Among the DeVos and Prince family members who received their undergraduate degrees at Calvin is Betsy DeVos, the conservative activist who has championed Christian schooling and served as education secretary in the Trump administration. One of the largest donations in Calvin\u2019s history was a pair of $10 million contributions, one each from DeVos and Prince family foundations, that underwrote construction of the DeVos Communications Center and the Prince Conference Center. The DeVos center is now home to an institute that focuses on Christianity and public life.In 2021, Hoekstra wrote an email to several officials and professors in which he recounted some of the reasons he\u2019d stepped away from the board a year earlier. He mentioned some recent university-sponsored seminars on inclusiveness, one of which he called a \u201croadshow,\u201d as well as a story he had heard about a Calvin graduate who \u201chad a double mastectomy, changed her identity from she to he and married her female partner.\u201d\u201cParents and students have the right to believe teaching at Calvin will reflect that sex has its rightful place in the context of a marriage between one man and one woman,\u201d Hoekstra wrote. \u201cI could not remain as a trustee, who had executed the very same Covenant as you, knowing that faculty members were endorsing same sex marriage and the board and administration was unwilling to hold them accountable to the prescribed process.\u201dKuilema told me he thinks he\u2019s the professor in the email, although he can\u2019t be sure. Hoekstra declined to answer questions about either the email or his broader feelings about the school. As for the reference to parents, that resonates with what a number of people in the greater Calvin universe told me about the school, the image and its future as a financially stable institution. \u201cSome parents send their children to Calvin, or to some other Christian school, in order to stop them from being gay,\u201d said Smith, who ran the speaker series. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t actually work that way,\u201d she added quickly. But in the face of a shrinking enrollment pool, and given that families with more affirming attitudes might be less interested in a religious school anyway, Calvin has a strong incentive to make sure the school remains appealing to families who expect it to remain a bulwark against a culture increasingly supportive of the LGBTQ community.\u201cThe market really plays to conservative Christians in the Christian college orbit,\u201d said Kristin Du Mez, a history professor and author of the 2020 bestseller \u201cJesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation.\u201d\u201cI can say that whereas before I\u2019ve always felt like I belonged at Calvin \u2026 that\u2019s now an open question. And I think it is for many of us.\u201dKuilema started the 23-page letter appealing the school\u2019s decision on his contract by recounting his deep ties to the college. \u201cI love Calvin University,\u201d he wrote, noting that both his parents and his wife were graduates and that he had been part of campus life since he was a kid. He also spoke about his faith and its centrality to his work: \u201cI love the idea of being \u2018reformed and always reforming according to the word of God,\u2019 the sense that God is alive and active, moving and working in God\u2019s creation, and that we return again and again to God\u2019s word to discern and confess what each new moment demands of us.\u201dUnder faculty guidelines, a successful appeal requires demonstration of procedural errors or injustices \u2015 or relevant information that university officials lacked while making their decision. Kuilema said there were several, arguing that faculty guidelines were unclear about the restrictions on conduct and whose permission he needed to seek. He argued that his church, not Calvin officials, were the rightful arbiters of whether his actions violated CRC doctrine. He also recounted his efforts to demonstrate he could live up to the standards in the tenure denial letter while reprising some of his substantive critiques of the CRC position.By this time, his case was getting media attention and public support \u2015 through those online alumni and faculty petitions, plus an opinion article in Chimes, written by psychology professor Emily Helder, hailing his contributions and warning that \u201cI am finding it increasingly difficult to work at Calvin with integrity.\u201d It was amid the growing outcry that I met with Noah Toly at his campus office on a rainy day in early May.Toly is something of an outsider at Calvin. He\u2019s not from the Midwest and didn\u2019t grow up in the CRC, although he belonged to churches with similar theological bearings. He came to Calvin from Wheaton College, the evangelical Protestant school in Illinois where he was an undergraduate and then a professor of urban studies and politics. His 2020 book, \u201cThe Gardeners\u2019 Dirty Hands: Environmental Politics and Christian Ethics,\u201d uses Greek and biblical texts to think through debates about climate change, which he believes is real and requires policy responses. Its theme is the need to recognize and accept the tradeoffs \u2015 even painful ones. Toly maintained the institution\u2019s silence on the specifics of the Kuilema case but addressed some of the broader issues it raised for an institution like Calvin \u2015 including the apparent tension between academic freedom and fealty to biblical authority, which, Toly said, didn\u2019t really exist in the way many outsiders imagine. \u201cWe assume that God has made that world both good and intelligible to us and has called us and equipped us for vocations of serious intellectual inquiry,\u201d he said, calling Calvin\u2019s commitment to academic freedom one of its great virtues. \u201cAnd we believe that that inquiry is not going to lead us to conclusions that are against the grain of God\u2019s truth as revealed in Scripture or taught by the church.\u201dWhen I pressed Toly about the obligations of faculty who find CRC positions on issues like same-sex marriage objectionable and who believe Scripture is on their side, he said the university respects the right to dissent. But, he said, \u201cthe expectation to abide by those positions remains even for those who disagree.\u201dCalvin\u2019s position will only become more precarious following the big Synod vote this past week, which makes opposition to same-sex relationships a matter of confessional status \u2015 in other words, something that congregations can\u2019t violate. Many observes believe it will turn the existing divide over sexuality within the denomination into a potentially irreparable breach, in ways that resemble the broader polarization of U.S. politics.Congregations with more affluent, more highly educated members are more likely to recognize LGBTQ relationships. Many of them are in and around Grand Rapids, whose downtown is full of bars and restaurants with pride flags. One of churches recently elected a deacon who is in a same-sex marriage. Congregations in more rural areas and with more blue-collar members are more likely to have the traditional view, that same-sex marriage and homosexual activity more generally is sinful. So do many foreign chapters within the CRC, which have been providing a critical source of new membership at a time when churchgoing across denominations in the U.S. is falling. During the debate at the Synod, those foreign CRC congregations were among those supporting adoption of the stricter human sexuality standard, according to an account in The Banner.It could take a few years for the results of the Synod vote on sexuality to take full effect as the denomination goes through its own process of bureaucratic implementation. But there\u2019s already widespread talk of individual churches breaking away from the CRC. At Calvin, prominent faculty, such as history professor Du Mez, are openly questioning what it all means for the denomination and the school.\u201cI can say that whereas before I\u2019ve always felt like I belonged at Calvin and within the CRC, that\u2019s now an open question,\u201d Du Mez told me. \u201cAnd I think it is for many of us.\u201d\u201cThe hardest thing, I think, has been seeing LGBTQ students wrestle with this. What does this mean for them? And can they still be here?\u201dWhatever Calvin\u2019s future, Kuilema won\u2019t be part of it. In late May, he got a letter from Bruce Los, chair of the Board of the Trustees. It was just two pages and conspicuously lacking in the pleasantries of earlier communications. It disputed Kuilema\u2019s claims, concluding that he failed to show either process errors or incomplete information in the university decision. Absent those two conditions, Los said, there was no grounds for reversal. Los said the university\u2019s decision did not represent a substantive judgment on either Calvin or CRC policies toward the LGBTQ community. The core issue, he said, was Kuilema\u2019s failure to work \u201cwithin college policies and procedures\u201d and to act in ways that would \u201cstrengthen the [university] and the broader Christian community in constructive and transparent ways.\u201dThe decision shook other professors, including Rachel Venema, who joined the faculty about the same time that Kuilema did and, like him, has a Calvin undergraduate degree. When we spoke in May, while Kuilema\u2019s appeal was still pending, Venema said she was torn about her future. \u201cThe hardest thing, I think, has been seeing LGBTQ students wrestle with this,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhat does this mean for them? And can they still be here? I really want them to know that there are still plenty of people on campus who are affirming of their identity and their relationships. But I also feel like my CV, like having worked at Calvin for 13 years, is starting to become a sort of a liability in the field of social work. I think that there may be some assumptions about who I am and what I think about same-sex relationships \u2015 things that aren\u2019t true. And so I feel like I need to be on the record in some way.\u201dLast week, Venema revealed her plans in an email to colleagues. She has decided to leave. One other question I asked Toly was about prospective students who identify as queer. What advice would he give them about attending Calvin? He was unequivocal: He said he hoped that they would come, that they would feel like they would be loved. He noted that the rules against intimacy outside of marriage apply equally to students of all sexual orientations. Asking for celibacy might seem like a lot, he acknowledged, but college is just four years.\u201cWe all at various points in our lives join communities or institutions that have rules or norms we wouldn\u2019t make ourselves,\u201d Toly said. \u201cWe often find ourselves submitting to those rules or norms, for a season at least.\u201dI put the same questions to the students and alumni I interviewed, including those who now identify as part of the LGBTQ community. The responses varied, with some saying it was worth coming to Calvin in order to push it in a more progressive direction and others saying the difficulties were simply too great.Sweda said she would advise queer students to go to secular colleges, although she says some don\u2019t have that choice because their parents won\u2019t pay tuition if they don\u2019t attend Christian schools. \u201cThe point a lot of people miss is that, for a lot of queer students... there is some sort of financial or family coercion going on there.\u201d Sweda has actually set up a GoFundMe, which she says she uses to help LGBTQ Calvin students while on campus.A very real possibility is that Calvin could evolve over the next few years so that it has fewer students like Sweda and fewer professors like Kuilema, creating a campus and academic environment both more aligned with CRC teachings and more insulated from the culture around it. Universities like Bob Jones, Liberty and Oral Roberts offer a possible glimpse of that future. They have never had Calvin\u2019s reputation for intellectual diversity. And although those schools have LGBTQ students, over the years many have spoken about the shame and stigma they feel, even instances of abuse, while experts and advocates worry about the toll on the students\u2019 mental health. This was the biggest concern I heard over and over again from former staff who worked with LGBTQ students \u2015 their fears for students struggling with issues of identity and sexual orientation, maybe for the first time and perhaps without sympathetic families.\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as just giving a philosophical and theological message like this without affecting someone\u2019s well-being, because people internalize it,\u201d said Kelsey Colburn, who was coordinator of student success and sexuality programming from 2019 to 2021. \u201cIf you\u2019re telling queer young people \u2026 that [they] shouldn\u2019t be able to be in relationships, then they end up wrestling with that themselves internally and thinking maybe I\u2019m not OK, maybe there\u2019s something wrong with me, maybe God doesn\u2019t want me this way. And that can lead to severe mental health problems. I\u2019ve seen it.\u201dAs for Kuilema, he has a wife, a toddler and two baby twins. For all of the recent discussion about morality and student well-being, Scripture and institutional integrity, Kuilema is still a working parent with bills to pay. When I called him last week, he was on the job market, looking for a faculty position at another institution.I asked him how he was feeling, given that Calvin has been part of his life for as long as he can remember, and whether he now wished he had made a different decision about the wedding. He admitted to some emotional ups and downs, likening them to the process of a grieving cycle, but added, \u201cI strongly believe that it was the right thing to do, that it was consistent with everything that I believe. I wish we had been able to find a way to work it out, but I don\u2019t regret officiating at all.\u201dA few days later he was back at Calvin for a protest against the Synod vote. He brought his kids, calling it a \u201cfamily tradition.\u201d Senior National Correspondent, HuffPost"}

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostAt a Republican fundraiser in Stateline, Idaho, a local GOP official named Dan Bell was excited to introduce the next speaker. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely not OK with trans or any of that gay shit,\u201d Bell, youth chair of the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee, said into the microphone as the crowd laughed. \u201cPlease give it up for Dave Reilly!\u201dReilly took the stage that day, April 16, to cheers. \u201cA big round of applause for our Sheriff Norris, who keeps us safe!\u201d Reilly said, pointing to Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris in the crowd, according to video footage obtained by HuffPost. Reilly is a white nationalist who recently moved to Idaho and aims to take over the state political system from the ground up. In the crowd with the sheriff was a mix of fellow white nationalists, along with Proud Boys, militiamen and a far-right bike gang. Over the ensuing two months, what bound this group together was a deep ire toward LGBTQ people and a desire to stop a Pride event in nearby Coeur D\u2019Alene on June 11. With the blessing of local Republican officials and using the same rhetoric as many GOP politicians nationwide, this far-right coalition churned out propaganda falsely labeling Pride as a haven for \u201cgroomers\u201d and \u201cpedophiles.\u201d Participants also issued warnings to would-be Pride attendees: We\u2019ll be there to confront you, and we\u2019ll be armed. And they were. Bigots turned out in big numbers to harass and intimidate their queer neighbors. A U-Haul truck full of masked men from the white supremacist group Patriot Front turned up ready to storm the Pride event, but they were stopped by police and arrested on charges of conspiring to riot, sparking a wave of national headlines. All 31 men have now been identified and charged with conspiracy to riot. Democratic state Rep. Chris Mathias has suggested prosecutors pursue harsher felony charges under a state terror statute. On Thursday, U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush sent a letter to the U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland urging him to consider federal charges under the Anti-Riot Act. \u201cIt appears these people did not come here to engage in peaceful events,\u201d Norris told a local reporter. The sheriff protected the Pride event from far-right antagonists and got to take some credit for the shocking bust that unmasked 31 white supremacists (a local hotel worker had tipped off his office after seeing them pile into the truck).But there\u2019s also little accounting for Norris\u2019 connections to the very far-right coalition that made Coeur D\u2019Alene Pride a target. Patriot Front needs to be understood as a part of the militant wing of the Republican Party\u2019s revanchist campaign to erase trans people from public life and push queer people back into the closet. When the right uses eliminationist rhetoric about LBGTQ people, it can\u2019t then feign shock when straight-up fascists show up to support its cause. This last year has seen Republican politicians and right-wing media influencers across the country stir up a moral panic about the LGBTQ community being \u201cgroomers\u201d \u2014 a term for manipulating children to make them vulnerable to sexual abuse. A wave of anti-LGBTQ laws, like Florida\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t say gay\u201d bill, has swept the nation. This type of rhetoric and legislation has inspired far-right groups to confront and harass queer people in America at an accelerating rate that experts fear could soon mean more violence. And it\u2019s no coincidence this particular group chose Idaho. It was one of the first states to pass anti-trans laws related to state documents and youth sports, and moreover, it has been ground zero for a far-right effort to take power by the ballot box. Eric Ward, director of the Western States Center, a Portland, Oregon-based civil rights organization that monitors right-wing extremists, said in a statement this week that \u201cIdaho is a bellwether state for where the rest of the country may be headed in terms of how anti-democracy groups try to build power.\u201dNorris, the Kootenai County Sheriff, did not respond to a request for comment on why he lent the imprimatur of his office to the gathering of bigots and extremists at Cruisers Bar & Grill back in April. Carl Bjerke, a retired firefighter from California who recently won the local GOP primary for Idaho state Senate \u2014 which, in a conservative place like North Idaho, means he\u2019s all but guaranteed to win the general election \u2014 was photographed at the event. He also didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about his attendance. Neither did Bell, the event\u2019s organizer and youth chair of the Kootenai County Republican Central Committee \u2014 an organization that\u2019s part of the Christian nationalist insurgency across Idaho. The headliner for the occasion was Bryson Gray, a MAGA rapper who recently released a homophobic song called \u201cPride Month\u201d that includes the lyrics: \u201cIf a man would kiss another man, he\u2019ll prolly kiss a child / Saying this was normal ten years ago, now it\u2019s not allowed / I\u2019m saying what other people think but I say it loud / How you a happy degenerate? Reprobate and proud.\u201d In a music video for the song, Gray can be seen lighting a rainbow Pride flag on fire. During his trip to north Idaho, Gray was photographed with a pair of white nationalist figures who have been welcomed with open arms into the region\u2019s Republican circles over the past year: Reilly, who moved to Idaho recently from Pennsylvania, and Vincent James Foxx, who moved from California.Reilly and Foxx, both of whom have extensive histories of extremism, have been at the center of the anti-LGBTQ push in North Idaho, and their propaganda has often received a boost from national right-wing media influencers. Back in December, according to a video obtained by HuffPost, Reilly spoke at a library board hearing in Post Falls, Idaho, where he lives. Holding his baby in his arms, Reilly \u2014 who has said \u201cevery Jew is dangerous\u201d and who marched at the deadly 2017 neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2014 took to the podium to speak in favor of removing LGBTQ-related content from the library. \u201cIt\u2019s not about censorship, it\u2019s about them promoting a gay agenda and corrupting our children,\u201d Reilly said. \u201cThese people are perverts and they are trying to pervert our children. Either we say no and tell them to go somewhere where they are welcome \u2014 like Portland or Seattle or LA or San Francisco. Get out of our community!\u201d Some in the crowd jeered, but more cheered for Reilly \u2014 who was endorsed by the local Republican committee in an unsuccessful bid for a school board seat last year. \u201cIdaho is a bellwether state for where the rest of the country may be headed in terms of how anti-democracy groups try to build power.\u201dA few months later, in mid-April, Reilly and Foxx turned their attention to the upcoming Pride event in Coeur D\u2019Alene. \u201cGroomers are going to try and gather in the park in June,\u201d Foxx alerted his 95,000 followers on Gab, the fascist-friendly social media platform. By mid-May, Foxx was delighted to see that other far-right groups in the area were now aware of Pride. \u201cThe Panhandle Patriots and several other groups plan to protest the \u2018Pride in the Park\u2019 event in Coeur d\u2019Alene on June 11th,\u201d Foxx wrote on Telegram for his 40,000 followers on that platform. \u201cGod bless Idaho!\u201dFoxx linked to a video showing Panhandle Patriots \u201csergeant at arms\u201d Jeff White speaking at an event hosted by Republican state Rep. Heather Scott.\u201cWe are having an event the very same day,\u201d White said of Pride. \u201cThat very same day we actually intend to go head to head with these people. A line has to be drawn in the sand. Good people need to stand up. And she [Scott] was talking about the repercussions. We say, damn the repercussions. Stand up, take it to the head. Go to the fight.\u201d After facing some negative media backlash over the remarks, Panhandle Patriots \u2014 which is known to turn up to political events with guns \u2014 issued a statement claiming their counter-demonstration at Pride would be \u201cpeaceful\u201d but added: \u201cWe implore the Christian community to come together and show these LGBT groomers that North Idaho stands firmly against their sick agenda and that God still rules in the Panhandle.\u201dIn late May, Reilly seized on the fact that one of the slated Coeur D\u2019Alene \u201cPride in the Park\u201d vendors was The Satanic Temple. A little online research shows the Satanic Temple is a secular organization that does not actually believe in the deity of Satan, but uses him as a mascot to critique religious fundamentalism. \u201cThe mission of The Satanic Temple is to encourage benevolence and empathy, eject tyrannical authority, advocate practical common sense, oppose injustice, and undertake noble pursuits,\u201d the group\u2019s website states. But in Reilly\u2019s hysterical rendering, the group was a cabal of evil \u201csatanists\u201d conspiring with degenerate queers to groom kids. \u201cThe Satanic Temple Announcing Attendance at Coeur d\u2019Alene\u2019s \u201cPride in the Park\u201d \u2014 All Ages Event to Host Drag Queen Show for Idaho Children,\u201d read a headline on the Idaho Tribune, a junk news website masquerading as a legitimate news source that, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, is run by the same person that runs Reilly\u2019s campaign website. The Idaho Tribune\u2019s stories about Coeur D\u2019Alene Pride got a boost from viral right-wing Twitter accounts, most notably LibsOfTikTok, the one-million follower behemoth run by a Brooklyn real estate agent named Chaya Raichik.In the weeks leading up to Pride, Raichik used LibsOfTikTok \u2014 which is now funded by conservative activist and entrepreneur Seth Dillon \u2014 to spread fear over drag queen performances and other LGBT+ events. Reilly encouraged Raichik on Twitter to post about Coeur D\u2019Alene, and she repeatedly obliged. Extremism reporter David Neiwert notes that Raichik was \u201capparently in such close contact with Reilly that one of LibOfTikTok\u2019s tweets promoted a Tribune story about 20 minutes after it was published.\u201d The Satanic Temple eventually pulled out of the event. By June 11, extremists across America knew about \u201cPride in the Park\u201d in Coeur D\u2019Alene. Some men carried AR-15s. Others wore neo-Nazi skull masks while holding a \u201cGroomers Are Not Welcome in Idaho\u201d banner. And other men, according to a dispatch from Neiwert, held signs \u201cciting the Leviticus verse that recommends homosexuals be put to death.\u201d And then there were Reilly and Foxx, who led a couple dozen Christian nationalists in prayer near \u201cPride in the Park.\u201d The far right already had a menacing presence at the Pride event when, at around 2 p.m., the U-Haul truck arrived. Police threw open the back door, revealing masked white men packed in like sardines, their hands up. Of the 31 Patriot Front members arrested, only two were from Idaho. A handful of them were from just across the state border in Spokane, Washington. The rest hailed from a dozen states, including Texas, home of the group\u2019s 23-year-old, cowboy-hat-wearing leader, Thomas Rousseau. Rousseau and Reilly both marched at the 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, where a neo-Nazi associated with a group called Vanguard America drove his car through a crowd of anti-racist protesters, killing one woman and injuring 19 others. Rousseau was a member of Vanguard America, which dissolved after the attack. He formed the Patriot Front in its ashes, organizing chapters across the country. Over the last couple of years, he\u2019s led the group in a nationwide hate crime spree, destroying dozens of Black Lives Matter murals and symbols across the country, according to a HuffPost investigation earlier this year. A video obtained by the independent media collective Unicorn Riot also showed Patriot Front members burning a rainbow Pride flag during a ceremony in the woods. \u201cTo those who destroy our nation, we will destroy your symbols and all that you worship,\u201d one of the members says in the video. \u201cIf you think we will lay down and perish, you are gravely mistaken.\u201dPatriot Front members, like hooded Ku Klux Klan members in the 1920s, often keep their membership in the group a secret, so the 31 arrests on June 11 in Coeur D\u2019Alene amounted to a mass-doxxing event.As the Patriot Front members sat in the grass, hands zip-tied behind their backs, most wouldn\u2019t talk to police, according to a report from the Coeur D\u2019Alene Press. But Wesley Van Horn of Lexington, Alabama, allegedly did. When a police officer remarked that Van Horn had \u201ctraveled a long way for his cause,\u201d Van Horn replied, \u201cWe go where we\u2019re needed.\u201dClarification: Language has been edited to clarify the location of the photos taken of Bryson Gray; to clarify Dave Reilly\u2019s relationship to the Idaho Tribune; and to clarify that The Satanic Temple was scheduled to be a vendor at the Pride event, not a sponsor.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPostRepublican Senate nominee Herschel Walker confirmed that he actually has four children, following revelations that the critic of absentee fathers has a 10-year-old son with whom he reportedly has limited contact.In addition to the 10-year-old, the aspiring Georgia senator has a 13-year-old son as well as an adult daughter who he had when he was around 20 years old, The Daily Beast first reported Thursday. He also has a 22-year-old son who he has previously publicly disclosed.This brings his total, publicly reported children to four.\u201cI have four children. Three sons and a daughter. They\u2019re not \u2018undisclosed\u2019 - they\u2019re my kids. I support them all and love them all,\u201d Walker said in a statement to HuffPost Thursday.The former football star, who has received the endorsement of former President Donald Trump, said he has never denied having four kids \u2015 despite conflicting comments made by his campaign Wednesday.Walker said he reported the four children to the federal government when appointed to the President\u2019s Council on Sports Fitness and Nutrition by Trump in 2018. He reportedly shared with the Daily Beast a copy of the form he filled out for this appointment, which listed the names and ages of all four kids.Walker, in his statement to HuffPost, said he \u201cchose not to use them as props to win a political campaign. What parent would want their child involved in garbage, gutter politics like this?\u201d\u201cSaying I hide my children because I don\u2019t discuss them with reporters to win a campaign? That\u2019s outrageous. I can take the heat, that\u2019s politics - but leave my kids alone,\u201d he added.Walker\u2019s campaign has made no prior mention of these children until now. In a statement to HuffPost on Wednesday, his campaign manager, Scott Paradise, said he had one child when he was unmarried years ago. \u201cHerschel had a child years ago when he wasn\u2019t married,\u201d the statement said. \u201cHe\u2019s supported the child and continues to do so. He\u2019s proud of his children. To suggest that Herschel is \u2018hiding\u2019 the child because he hasn\u2019t used him in his political campaign is offensive and absurd.\u201dNews of Walker\u2019s additional children is noteworthy as he has been a public critic of children being raised in fatherless homes. The Daily Beast reported Tuesday that the mother of his 10-year-old son had to sue Walker after giving birth in order to secure a declaration of paternity and child support from the former NFL player. He has not played an active parental role in this younger son\u2019s life, though he sends him Christmas and birthday presents, The Daily Beast reported, citing a person close to the child\u2019s family.In a 2020 interview with conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Walker called fatherless homes a \u201cmajor, major problem\u201d in Black communities and described himself as acting \u201clike a father\u201d to fatherless kids in the Georgia town where he grew up.\u201cRemember, you can leave the wife, but don\u2019t leave your child,\u201d he said he advises young men he meets.In another 2020 interview with conservative video bloggers Diamond and Silk, Walker disparaged Black fathers who leave boys to be raised by their mother. He likened this to when Black families were separated during slavery.\u201cEven if you have to leave that woman \u2014 you don\u2019t leave that child,\u201d he said.Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPostNEW YORK \u2015 On June 15, 2012, President Barack Obama established the landmark Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which provided a lifeline for a portion of the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers, who were brought to the U.S. as children.It was also a compromise, implemented after Congress failed to pass the DREAM Act in 2010, which would have guaranteed much broader protections for Dreamers, including a path to citizenship. DACA\u2019s fate has been turbulent, particularly under Obama\u2019s successor, President Donald Trump, who attempted to end DACA in 2017, as part of his administration\u2019s racist and anti-immigrant policies. The program has remained intact after surviving several court challenges, including a 2020 Supreme Court decision determining the Trump administration wrongly ended DACA. On day 1 of his presidency in 2021, President Joe Biden launched an effort to preserve the program. However, last summer, a federal judge ruled DACA was illegal and barred the Biden administration from accepting new applicants, plunging its fate into further limbo.While the program has continued to provide relief and safety for the more than 600,000 current DACA recipients, they\u2019ve had to live through a decade of highs and lows. To mark DACA\u2019s 10th anniversary and reflect on the unfinished political fight, Obama and a panel of five DACA recipients and young leaders held a discussion, released Wednesday by the Obama Foundation and filmed in late May at New World Stages in New York. That setting added an extra layer of significance to the conversation, which HuffPost attended. The group convened on the stage where the new musical \u201c\u00a1Americano!\u201d is running through June 19. It tells the story of Dreamer and political organizer Tony Valdovinos, one of the participants in the discussion. In setting the context for the group\u2019s conversation, the former president underscored the vital role DACA recipients\u2019 personal stories have played in advocating for political change. \u201cNone of that would have happened had it not been for a bunch of young people at that time, who, at great risk to themselves, were willing to announce their status,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe courage to tell your stories is what led people to understand just how unfair the status quo was and why we need to change. And so, I think my main message on this 10th anniversary is just to thank you and the hundreds of thousands that you represent, because had it not been for your courage and example that you set, we might not have gotten this done, or got the ball as far down the field as we had.\u201dMany of them brought up how DACA itself gave them the security to tell their stories \u2015 and, in turn, pursue opportunities that could help others. Valdovinos noted how being a DACA recipient allowed him to get his first jobs as a political organizer and then \u201cpush harder for what we were originally fighting for, which is the freedom to exist in this country and have opportunities,\u201d he told Obama.Josue de Paz, the CEO and co-founder of First Tech Fund, a technology non-profit, described how DACA meant being able to think \u201cbeyond just today and thinking about, you know, \u2018Am I going to be safe? Is my mom gonna be safe?\u2019\u201d Prior to DACA, \u201cI didn\u2019t have space to hope for the future. I didn\u2019t have space to hope for: \u2018What can I do for the community?\u2019\u201d he said.Similarly, Sumbul Siddiqui, a medical student at Loyola University Chicago, said DACA has given her the peace of mind to \u201cthink about your studies, and we\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201dShe recounted the loneliness she felt prior to DACA in 2011, when she graduated from high school. \u201cI was just learning about my immigration status, and I didn\u2019t know that there was anyone else out there like me. So it was a very, very depressing time,\u201d she said, describing how she had to enroll in college as an international student, despite not being one. \u201cNow that I\u2019m looking back, I\u2019m a different person because of DACA. I am where I am now because of DACA and all the people who\u2019ve been advocating for us. I\u2019m not alone. I was in 2011, but now I\u2019m open.\u201dSiddiqui also referenced the \u201croller coaster\u201d of watching DACA\u2019s political and legal fate hang in the balance over the last few years. It\u2019s an uncertainty with which Devashish Basnet is also intimately familiar, explaining he was in high school during the 2016 election and early years of the Trump presidency.\u201cIt\u2019s a really strange feeling that anyone that\u2019s not a DACA recipient could have some difficulty understanding. The news notifications tell you that the future of DACA is at stake, and the future of your status in this country is at stake,\u201d said Basnet, who just graduated from Hunter College and was named a Rhodes Scholar, with plans to pursue a masters\u2019 degree in refugee and forced migration studies at Oxford. \u201cJuggling college applications and checking your phone to see if your status is going to be the same is a harrowing kind of experience. When I think about the mobilizing and what that did for me, I think DACA gave me the opportunity to advocate for myself, because as much as mobilizing and organizing is critical, it\u2019s about changing hearts and minds.\u201dAt the same time, Basnet noted being an advocate is a delicate balance. DACA recipients have had to be public advocates while also personally advocating for their own family\u2019s basic survival.\u201cIt\u2019s a really interesting experience to grow up being an advocate, whether for yourself or for your parents,\u201d Basnet said. \u201cWe all serve as second translators, and I think all of us understood immigration policy more than young students should have.\u201dJessica Astudillo\u2019s early experiences of having to be a translator for her parents helped shape her path toward becoming a doctor and taught her how to be resourceful. \u201cPart of the reason why I got into healthcare was because I was that person at seven, eight years of age trying to translate medical terminology for my parents,\u201d said Astudillo, a resident physician in pediatrics at NYU Langone. \u201cEven now, you know, I\u2019ve been blessed with the opportunity to help a couple of my family members obtain citizenship. Obviously, I\u2019m not a lawyer, but I know how to find the answers. I think that\u2019s something important that even now, as a physician, I might not know everything. I absolutely don\u2019t know everything. But I can figure it out, and I know where to look.\u201dIn framing the discussion, Obama also referenced the challenge of balancing the benefits and burdens of advocacy. \u201cI wish I could say that you don\u2019t have to be courageous anymore, and you can just focus on a different kind of courage: All the good work you guys are doing in the community. But this is something that we\u2019re still gonna have to keep on advocating for,\u201d he told the group, noting that the fight is unfinished.In response, Valdovinos had a question for the former president. \u201cWhat do we do next? We lost a lot of steam, watching Congress vote down the DREAM Act, and obviously, you left office, and other folks took office, and here we are now,\u201d he said. \u201cUltimately, I think a lot of Dreamers really lost the unity of working with each other for a solution. So I guess my question is: How do you advise us to continue organizing?\u201d\u201cI spend most of my time now working with young people like yourselves because it\u2019s my view that on a whole spectrum of issues, it\u2019s your voices that are going to come up with a solution. My generation, I think, moved forward on some fronts, but have stalled, as you said, on others,\u201d Obama told Valdovinos. \u201cOne thing I\u2019ve learned with young people, they can sniff out if somebody\u2019s BSing them.\u201dObama went on to cite the power of \u201cstorytelling, whether it\u2019s through plays or movies or articles or books or TikTok \u2014 I mean, whatever it is, right?\u201d he said. \u201cIt puts a human face on the issue in a way that it\u2019s harder to not do the right thing.\u201dBut he also acknowledged how much the country has changed politically in the last decade, and the uphill battle Dreamers continue to face. \u201cWe\u2019re at a moment in time where the political gears are stuck,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s gonna take some work for us to unstick \u2019em.\u201dLater, Valdovinos said Obama\u2019s answer to his question, as well as the discussion itself, was sobering. It was also a full-circle moment for him personally, and a realization that his outlook has changed too, as he recalled in a phone interview from his office in Phoenix, where he is the founder of La Machine, a political consulting firm. Early in his career, Valdovinos met Obama briefly at a rally in 2012. \u201cWe asked him for help on how to organize. And he told us to organize, organize, organize, and that really, just for me, tremendously made a difference. And then, to be an adult and not be a 22-year-old, to be 31 and sitting there in front of him, was very different,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was tough to hear his story on immigration, and it was tough to realize that we\u2019re in a tougher moment. And I think all the hopefulness and eagerness of organizing in your 20s wears up when you become an adult. And the world feels very differently, looks very differently and the road looks longer.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m actually looking at one of his stickers I still have to this day,\u201d he continued, referring to Obama\u2019s famous \u201cHOPE\u201d campaign poster, designed by Shepard Fairey. Today, Valdovinos said, that youthful sense of hope has now turned into a hardened \u201cresilience.\u201d\u201cWhen I first joined organizing, I legitimately believed as a young adult that we were going to see this country move forward, that the DREAM Act was going to be passed, that we were going to be able to earn citizenship through military service or academic achievements. And then, none of that happened,\u201d he said. \u201cYou talk to me today, the objectives are different, the future is different. And I don\u2019t think it has anything really to do with feeling hopeful. I think it has everything to do with resilience, and ultimately sharing our stories, our stories of contribution in this country and fighting back the narratives from our former president that put a very negative light on our communities. And I think that\u2019s what I do. I try and share our culture, our story, our commitment.\u201dAs portrayed in \u201c\u00a1Americano!,\u201d Valdovinos\u2019 childhood dream was joining the Marines. When he turned 18 and went to enlist, he found out he was an undocumented immigrant, forcing him to redirect his dream into a different path. Finding a mentor in Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), a Marine veteran whom he helped elect to Congress, Valdovinos realized he could serve his country on the political battlefield instead. As founder of La Machine, he has run various campaigns in Arizona. For example, La Machine recently helped elect Yassamin Ansari, the first Iranian American to be an elected official in Arizona\u2019s history, and the youngest woman ever elected to Phoenix\u2019s city council. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed creating new opportunities and showing communities that we can be represented, that we can have a voice,\u201d he said.For years, Valdovinos has told his story as an organizer and advocate, and helped others craft their stories for voters. In an unexpected turn of events, his organizing career is also what led to a new chapter of telling his story: A musical based on his life. One of the musical\u2019s co-writers, Jonathan Rosenberg, heard Valdovinos on NPR, talking about his work organizing Latino voters during the 2016 election. Compelled by his story, Rosenberg reached out to Valdovinos and then brought the idea to Michael Barnard, the artistic director of the Phoenix Theatre Company. Over the next several years, a team of collaborators developed \u201c\u00a1Americano!,\u201d which premiered in Phoenix in early 2020, before its current run in New York.Valdovinos, who consulted on the production, describes it as a tale of \u201crealities and circumstances and choices,\u201d as well as a love story about the Marines, public service and what it means to be an American. The team behind the musical hopes it will head to Broadway next, particularly as one of the few major productions with a predominantly Latinx cast. Valdovinos said he\u2019s particularly proud the musical reflects \u201cjust the honest human experience, and it\u2019s not a Disney story.\u201d Like the discussion between Obama and the DACA recipients, the musical is also sobering at times. Toward the end, actor Sean Ewing, who plays Valdovinos, reminds the audience of the jeopardy that undocumented immigrants in the U.S. continue to face every day.While Valdovinos is excited about the musical\u2019s success and hopes it will continue to reach new audiences, he noted that \u201cultimately, it\u2019s based off of a reality politically, which is that there\u2019s a significant amount of human beings in this country that are stuck, that are in danger, or hiding, or whatever \u2014 it\u2019s so many different stories.\u201d\u201cOne of my only hopes is to humanize, honestly, our contribution in this country, because it has been very brutal to be seen as a negative addition in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cFor me, being an American is doing what you can for this country, and being the best you can for your community. And that\u2019s been my life\u2019s pursuit.\u201dSenior Culture Reporter, HuffPost"}
{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostThe fact that the first photo of Ryan Gosling as \u201cKen\u201d from the upcoming \u201cBarbie\u201d movie was released during Pride Month probably wasn\u2019t a coincidence since he seems to resemble a version of the doll that has become a gay icon.Many people noticed that Gosling\u2019s denim vest and bleached blond hair made him the spitting image of \u201cEarring Magic Ken,\u201d a version of Barbie\u2019s best male friend, released in 1993.See the resemblance? \u201cEarring Magic Ken\u201d reportedly arrived at a time when Mattel executives were looking to update Ken\u2019s image and surveyed children on what looked cool to them.However, the doll apparently became the bestselling version of Ken in Mattel history at the time thanks to its popularity with gay men.That\u2019s because Earring Magic Ken wore his accessory earring on the left earlobe, a lavender mesh shirt with a matching pleather vest, and, as Mel Magazine noted, a necklace that could possibly double as a \u201ccock ring.\u201dThat particular fashion accessory turned out to be particularly challenging for the Mattel PR person who had to explain it in a way that was acceptable to parents unfamiliar with what was stylish in the gay community at the time.Lisa McKendall, who was the manager of marketing and communications of Mattel Toys, insisted to The Chicago Reader that her employer was \u201cnot in the business of putting cock rings into the hands of little girls.\u201dShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s a necklace. It holds charms he can share with Barbie. C\u2019mon, this is a doll designed for little girls, something like that would be entirely inappropriate.\u201dAlthough many moms bought Earring Magic Ken for their kids, it was also selling well in the gay community.But In the Know reported that after the article made the cock ring connection, Mattel recalled the doll.No one connected with the Barbie movie has explicitly connected Gosling\u2019s version to Earring Magic Ken, but many people on Twitter couldn\u2019t help but think it was intentional.I'm finding it interesting that they went with the Earring Magic Ken sans cockring for Ryan Gosling in this movie. https://t.co/cq3df8kh29 pic.twitter.com/I2bwqu9tsJYou can't tell me that Ryan Gosling Ken doesn't look like the infamous Earring Magic Ken. pic.twitter.com/5ZKgInsuKc6/10. It looks A LOT like they're going for Earring Magic Ken, in which case he's missing the lilac mesh shirt and cock ring necklace. Which, given how badly Mattel wanted to bury that doll, means that the costume designer ABSOLUTELY needs to go all the way in that direction.This is Earring Magic Ken and it\u2019s the correct choice of Ken to go with for this absolutely homosexual film. https://t.co/zpT9Lj4hpOSenior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostSomeone once famously told Ryan Gosling, \u201cSeriously? It\u2019s like you\u2019re Photoshopped,\u201d which seems to be the direct inspiration for his role as Ken in the upcoming \u201cBarbie\u201d movie.In the abs-forward first look of the actor in director Greta Gerwig\u2019s live-action take on the iconic Mattel figure, Gosling embodies the plastic hunk in his full glory. Sporting bleached blonder than blond hair, presumably buckets of spray tan lotion and his own personalized \u201cKen\u201d underwear, the star leans into the fantasy in an image shared Wednesday by Warner Bros. In the photo, Gosling ever so suavely poses against a signature Barbie pink backdrop with his muscles busting out of a denim ensemble, which includes a ripped vest and matching jeans. The photo serves as the perfect complement to the first look at Margot Robbie as the titular doll released in April.If placed side-by-side, the famous couple could even be looking at each other, given the similar color palettes and coordinating outfits. Robbie, who is perched in the seat of a pink Chevrolet Corvette convertible in the photo, however, looks a bit more \u201960s inspired, while Gosling could be lifted directly out of a \u201990s Marky Mark-style underwear campaign.Apart from Robbie and Gosling, the film will star Kate McKinnon, Alexandra Shipp, America Ferrera, Ncuti Gatwa, Simu Liu, Will Ferrell, Issa Rae and Hari Nef. Written by Gerwig and partner Noah Baumbach, \u201cBarbie\u201d is set to hit theaters July 21, 2023.Details on the plot of the film remain scarce, but according to New York Times reporter Kyle Buchanan, the project will feature multiple versions of Barbie and Ken.Last month, Liu teased what fans might expect from the script, which an agent described as \u201cone of the best\u201d he had ever read. \u201cHe literally said this verbatim,\u201d the \u201cShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\u201d star told GQ. \u201cHe was like, \u2018If I could stake my career on any one script, it\u2019s the \u201cBarbie\u201d script. I really think you should do it.\u2019\u201dRobbie has also dropped some hints about the film\u2019s approach to the character. Back in 2020, the actor and producer remarked on the responsibility she feels to do right by Barbie\u2019s legacy and subvert audiences\u2019 expectations surrounding her casting.\u201cPeople immediately have an idea of, \u2018Oh, Margot is playing Barbie, I know what that is.\u2019\u201d she told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cBut our goal is to be like, \u2018Whatever you\u2019re thinking, we\u2019re going to give you something totally different \u2014 the thing you didn\u2019t know you wanted.\u2019\u201dGosling, meanwhile, will next be seen in Netflix\u2019s mega-expensive action thriller \u201cThe Gray Man\u201d opposite Chris Evans, who surely in some alternate universe would fill out Ken\u2019s cut-off denim vest quite nicely.Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Tom Rice (S.C.), one of just 10 House Republicans who voted in favor of impeaching Donald Trump in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, lost his bid for reelection Tuesday.Rice lost the GOP nomination to state Rep. Russell Fry in a campaign seemingly dominated by the shadow of Trump, who held a March 12 rally for Fry in Florence, South Carolina. A poll in May by the Trafalgar Group had put Rice well behind, at 25% to Fry\u2019s 42%. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.The primary field was crowded, but the attention mainly centered on Rice and Fry, who played up his endorsement from the former president.\u201cIt\u2019s like I said earlier, on June 14 it\u2019s our turn to vote and on June 14 here in the 7th Congressional District, we\u2019re going to vote to impeach Tom Rice at the ballot box,\u201d Fry said at the March rally while standing next to Trump.Trump took particular pleasure in campaigning against Republican House members who had voted for his impeachment, pointing out Rice by name in an interview with The Washington Post\u201cYou had people drop out of races that they had no intention of dropping out of, and the other ones are losing, like Rice in South Carolina,\u201d Trump said.Though Rice voted to impeach Trump, he also voted to support a challenge to certifying some Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, 2021, a vote he later said he regretted.\u201cIn the wee hours of that disgraceful night, while waiting for the Capitol of our great country to be secured, I knew I should vote to certify,\u201d Rice said in December. \u201cBut because I had made a public announcement of my intent to object, I did not want to go back on my word. So, yeah, I regret my vote to object.\u201dAfter the Trump rally in March, Rice called the former president a \u201cwould-be tyrant\u201d and said he only wanted \u201ca \u2018yes man\u2019 candidate\u201d in Fry.

As an influential artist I\u2019m dedicated to being part of the change I\u2019ve been waiting to see in the world,\u201d she wrote.A post shared by Lizzo (@lizzobeeating)In the opening verse of the new single, Lizzo sings: \u201cDo you see this shit? I\u2019ma spaz.\u201dAs a number of disability advocates noted after the song\u2019s Friday release, the slang term, sometimes used colloquially to mean crazy, clumsy or incompetent, is a derogatory word that stems from terminology used to describe conditions of certain movement disorders and cerebral palsy. Hey @lizzo my disability Cerebral Palsy is literally classified as Spastic Diplegia (where spasticity refers to unending painful tightness in my legs) your new song makes me pretty angry + sad. \u2018Spaz\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean freaked out or crazy. It\u2019s an ableist slur. It\u2019s 2022. Do better.Oh @lizzoA VERY influential figure, using the word sp@z in her new song. An offensive and derogatory term. As someone who\u2019s written about the use of disability language, especially slang/slur words which have been used in schools, this is a huge step back.Please, remove it.On Monday, the version of the song on Spotify contained a different lyric: \u201cDo you see this shit? Hold me back.\u201dSome of those who initially spoke out applauded Lizzo for the way she handled the situation:I\u2019m going to cry \ud83d\ude2d Thank you so much for hearing us Lizzo and for understanding that this was only ever meant gently and being open to learning, it honestly means the world \u2764\ufe0f.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Political Reporter, HuffPostDemocrats are attempting to steer the course of Republican primaries at an unprecedented level ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections, spending millions of dollars to promote GOP candidates they view as weak \u2015 even if those candidates embrace the very lies about the 2020 election that the party calls an existential threat to democracy.National Democratic groups and leading Democratic candidates have spent millions of dollars in Colorado, Illinois, Nevada and Pennsylvania to promote Republicans who both parties believe will struggle to win, even in a political environment shaped by high inflation and low approval ratings for President Joe Biden. Working to influence the other party\u2019s primaries has become common for Democrats and Republicans alike, in the years since former Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) famously promoted the late far-right Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo.) so she could face him in her 2012 Senate bid. But the scale and spending of current Democratic efforts \u2015 public spending now tops $10 million \u2015 have little precedent. Picking their opponent has paid off in the past for Democrats. They have their bare-minimum Senate majority in part because they worked to get an easier opponent for Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) in 2018. But the growing authoritarian bent of the GOP, the willingness of conservative candidates to embrace former President Donald Trump\u2019s false claims about the 2020 election, and the Republican-leaning political environment all make such maneuvering a trickier proposition.Democratic operatives have generally defended their efforts to shape Republican primaries as a bare-knuckle but necessary tactic to survive in a challenging political environment, noting ads that promote a candidate to GOP primary voters can also serve as effective attacks for a general election audience. But pundits both on the left and among \u201cNever Trump\u201d conservatives have criticized the strategy as risky, and reminiscent of the party\u2019s hopes in 2016 that Trump himself, a supposedly \u201cunelectable\u201d candidate, would secure the GOP presidential nomination.\u201cIn an environment like this, you want to go against a candidate that gives you the best chance to win. But there are no guarantees in this business,\u201d said Mike Mikus, a Pennsylvania-based Democratic strategist. \u201cBut sometimes you have to push the crazy person over the top, and play the odds.\u201d In Pennsylvania, Mikus has pronounced himself \u201cschizophrenic\u201d over the victory of far-right state Sen. Doug Mastriano in the GOP gubernatorial primary last month. Mastriano, who attended the Jan. 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally in Washington, D.C., and has fully embraced Trump\u2019s election lies, is widely seen as unelectable. But $5 gas could turn the politically impossible into a plausible outcome.\u201cFor Mastriano to win, it would have to be an absolute disaster we\u2019ve never seen anything like. But the environment\u2019s bad, and it could get worse,\u201d Mikus said.The latest example of this kind of Democratic gamble is in Colorado, where a freshly formed group, Democratic Colorado, has started running ads attacking state Rep. Ron Hanks (R) as \u201ctoo conservative.\u201d The ads are a clear attempt to raise GOP voters\u2019 awareness and opinion of Hanks, who attended the Jan. 6 rally outside the U.S. Capitol and has raised only paltry sums for his campaign. \u201cHe says Joe Biden\u2019s election was a fraud. Hanks wants to ban all abortions, and he wants to build Trump\u2019s border wall,\u201d a narrator says in the 30-second ad, which began airing Wednesday.#COSen: D group Democratic Colorado is up on TV with this spot calling R candidate Ron Hanks \"too conservative for Colorado\"#Meddling pic.twitter.com/jodJok2l3OHanks\u2019 dedication to election denial is real: The opening ad of his campaign showed him blowing up a Dominion voting machine. He\u2019s also admitted to crossing police barricades during the insurrection \u2013 although he also claimed the event was a false flag operation, with Black Lives Matter and antifa activists breaching the Capitol. That\u2019s led some Colorado Democrats to question the strategy behind the spots.\u201cIt is harmful to democracy,\u201d Dan Grossman, a former Colorado state legislator, wrote on Twitter. \u201cAmericans who value the rule of law, regardless of party and partisan advantage, should ensure that seditionists like Hanks never see the ballot as a major party nominee.\u201dThe timing of the ad\u2019s debut was not a coincidence. Wednesday was the first day a group could begin airing ads without having to reveal its donors before Hanks faces Joe O\u2019Dea, a comparatively moderate businessman, in the June 28 Republican primary. Unlike Hanks, O\u2019Dea has recognized Biden as the legitimate victor of the 2020 election. Neither candidate is particularly well known, and the winner will face Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet in November. In the past, Senate Majority PAC \u2015 a super PAC controlled by allies of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) \u2015 has funded pop-up groups like Democratic Colorado to try and influence GOP primaries.The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is barred from directly coordinating with super PACs that can raise and spend unlimited amounts, seemed to request ads highlighting Hanks\u2019 conservatism and bashing O\u2019Dea for supporting Democrats in the past with a post on a public website. O\u2019Dea\u2019s campaign said the interference is proof he\u2019s a real threat to Bennet in blue-tinted Colorado, and released internal polling showing him with a healthy lead over Hanks before the Democratic Colorado\u2019s ads began. \u201c[Democrats] are gonna try to steal this election, because they don\u2019t want to spend the money they\u2019re going to have to spend against me this fall,\u201d O\u2019Dea said in a radio interview Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m a real candidate.\u201d So far, however, the Democratic Governors Association has been the most proactive in GOP primaries, taking steps to shape contests in Illinois, Colorado and Nevada. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, the party\u2019s nominee for governor in the Keystone State, also ran ads aiming to ensure he\u2019d face Mastriano in the general election. Mastriano, who would have the power to appoint Pennsylvania\u2019s top elections official if he wins the governorship, won with the former president\u2019s endorsement. He\u2019s suggested he would decline to certify the 2024 election unless a Republican wins. Shapiro\u2019s ads, which similarly attacked Mastriano as a far-right conservative, were likely not the determining factor in his victory. He consistently led in polling, news outlets regularly covered his history of extreme views, and Pennsylvania\u2019s other major GOP candidates for governor similarly endorsed Trump\u2019s lies about the election.\u201cIt\u2019s not our fault Republican voters in Pennsylvania wanted this,\u201d a Democratic operative who worked on the race said, providing a link to a story about Mastriano\u2019s long history of comparing events to the Holocaust.Trump\u2019s election denialism holds considerable power over many GOP candidates and voters, and it\u2019s led some Democrats to conclude the threat to democracy would be the same no matter which candidate makes it to a general election.\u201cSometimes in campaigns the difference between the \u2018moderate\u2019 and the \u2018extreme\u2019 candidate is just in the rhetoric, and really their policy positions \u2015 or willingness to disregard the will of the people \u2015 are pretty much the same,\u201d said Adam Bozzi, the communications director for the liberal group End Citizens United. \u201cA radical disguised as a moderate can be very dangerous for democracy.\u201dIn its various efforts to shape GOP primaries, the Democratic Governors Association has tried to shrink the chances of the GOP establishment\u2019s preferred candidates \u2015 Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo in Nevada, University of Colorado Regent Heidi Ganahl and Illinois state Sen. Richard Irvin.Still, Democrats don\u2019t have to go back far to see the potential risks of their strategy. In 2020, national Democrats spent millions trying to boost former Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, a Trump acolyte and anti-immigration zealot, believing he would give their Senate candidate, state Sen. Barbara Bollier, a chance to win in a typically red state.The campaign failed, with Republicans nominating Rep. Roger Marshall instead. Marshall went on to defeat Bollier in the Senate race by almost 12 percentage points \u2015 a margin indicating Kobach almost certainly would have won the general as well.Senior Political Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The Instagram caption reads: \u201c45th President 45 yards from hole on 18.\u201d A post shared by Edmund Ruffin (@edruf)It\u2019s against the law to use the presidential seal in a way that could convey the impression of government approval or sponsorship of a private business. Violations can result in prison sentences of up to six months. The seal can only be used for official government business.The course is the fourth Trump property to use the seal in possible violation of the law, according to Forbes.

And he has gone out of his way to travel to his foreign golf courses with a large entourage \u2014 at taxpayer expense \u2014 to highlight the properties in international news stories.The Trump Organization could not immediately be reached for comment.Trends Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostAccording to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), former President Donald Trump bears some responsibility for an attack on the U.S. Capitol \u2015 along with everybody else in the country.During a news conference ahead of Thursday\u2019s hearing of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, McCarthy was asked if he still believed Trump bore some responsibility for the attack. \u201cLook, I\u2019ve answered that many times. I thought everybody in the country [bore] some responsibility, based upon what has been going on,\u201d McCarthy said, echoing remarks he\u2019s made in the past. \u201cThe riots on the streets, the others.\u201dIn the weeks after the Capitol riot, the Republican leader said both publicly and privately that Trump was responsible. \u201cThe president bears responsibility for Wednesday\u2019s attack on Congress by mob rioters,\u201d McCarthy said on the House floor on Jan. 13, 2021. \u201cHe should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding.\u201d Privately, his assessment was even harsher. In a leaked audio recording from Jan. 11, 2021, McCarthy said Trump \u201cbears responsibility for his words and actions. No ifs, ands or buts.\u201d In another recording, he said what Trump did on Jan. 6 was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and that \u201cnobody can defend that, and nobody should defend it.\u201dBut within a couple of weeks, he pivoted to doing just that. By Jan. 21, McCarthy was arguing that Trump never provoked the mob that laid siege to the Capitol, and offered his first iteration of this week\u2019s comment.\u201cI also think everybody across this country has some responsibility,\u201d he said in an interview at the time.His \u201criots on the streets\u201d comment Thursday was an apparent reference to the nationwide protests in 2020 over racial injustice and police violence against people of color, following the repeated police killings of Black Americans.Many Republicans have compared or conflated that unrest with the violence on Jan. 6, when a mob of Trump supporters, spurred on by his lies about the 2020 election, attacked law enforcement and stormed Congress in an attempt to stop the certification of the results and keep Trump in power.Senior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPostFor fans, Jennifer Lopez and Shakira\u2019s 2020 Super Bowl halftime show was a peak cultural moment in a year that came to be defined by both political divisions and a pandemic. Lopez, however, had a much different opinion on the massively hyped performance \u2015 or at least she did in the days leading up to it. In her Netflix documentary \u201cHalftime,\u201d the actor and singer is shown in rehearsals with her music director Kim Burse and appears visibly stressed over the time constraints. \u201cWe have six fucking minutes,\u201d Lopez proclaims, according to Entertainment Weekly. \u201cWe have 30 seconds of a song, and if we take a minute, that\u2019s it, we\u2019ve got five left. But there\u2019s got to be certain songs that we sing, though. We have to have our singing moments. It\u2019s not going to be a dance fucking revue. We have to sing our message.\u201d\u201cThis is the worst idea in the world to have two people do the Super Bowl,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt was the worst idea in the world.\u201dElsewhere in \u201cHalftime,\u201d Lopez doesn\u2019t hold back as she maps out the logistics of the show with Shakira directly. \u201cIf it was going to be a double-headliner, they should have given us 20 minutes,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what they should\u2019ve fucking done.\u201dCatch the trailer for \u201cHalftime\u201d below. In the end, Lopez and Shakira\u2019s performance lasted about 14 minutes. By comparison, Madonna in 2012 and Lady Gaga in 2017 were each given about 14 minutes to perform in the Super Bowl show. This year\u2019s halftime show, featuring Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Mary J. Blige, Eminem and Kendrick Lamar, clocked in at nearly 14 minutes. Lopez\u2019s manager Benny Medina shared his client\u2019s frustrations over the NFL\u2019s choice of a co-headlining performance. \u201cTypically, you have one headliner at a Super Bowl. That headliner constructs a show, and, should they choose to have other guests, that\u2019s their choice,\u201d he said, according to EW. \u201cIt was an insult to say you needed two Latinas to do the job that one artist historically has done.\u201dIn spite of their limited stage time, Lopez and Shakira each turned in a dazzling performance that won raves from critics and even managed to deliver a subtle political message. The Los Angeles Times applauded the divas for having \u201cfused old-school razzle-dazzle with an of-the-moment sense of Latin American pride,\u201d while Entertainment Weekly called it \u201cpunchy, political, and flat-out electric.\u201d \u201cHalftime,\u201d which premiered Wednesday at the 2022 Tribeca Film Festival in New York, follows Lopez as she \u201creflects on her milestones and evolution as an artist, and navigates the second half of her career continuing to entertain, empower and inspire,\u201d according to press notes.It\u2019s now available for streaming on Netflix.

The parents are reportedly seeking a protective court order on their child\u2019s behalf.Court documents obtained by multiple news outlets that were filed Tuesday in Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Court state that \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower\u201d star displays \u201ccult-like and psychologically manipulative, controlling behavior.\u201d The filings also allege that Miller \u201cuses violence, intimidation, threat of violence, fear, paranoia, delusions and drugs to hold sway over a young adolescent Tokata,\u201d according to the complaint. HuffPost reached out to Miller for comment but did not receive an immediate response Thursday.The parents, Chase Iron Eyes and Sara Jumping Eagle, allege Miller first met Tokata Iron Eyes at the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota in 2016. They say Miller, who prefers they/them pronouns, \u201ctook an immediate and apparently innocent liking\u201d to their child at the time, People reported.The parents allege that Miller gave Tokata Iron Eyes, whom they call their daughter, drugs as a teen and offered to pay for Tokata to attend Bard College in Massachusetts, according to People. Tokata Iron Eyes dropped out of Bard in December and has been flying around the country with Miller since \u2014 including to Hawaii, where the actor was arrested for second-degree assault after being accused of hitting a 26-year-old woman with a chair.Tokata Iron Eyes posted a statement to Instagram earlier this week addressing \u201cassumptions made on my behalf by my family and friends regarding my stability and otherwise.\u201dA post shared by @tokatawinIn the statement, Tokata Iron Eyes writes about dropping out of Bard due to needing \u201cspace and time for the processing of grief\u201d due to the loss of a friend.\u201cMy comrade Ezra Miller for the entirety of the aforementioned era has only provided loving support and invaluable protection throughout this period of loss,\u201d Tokata Iron Eyes wrote. \u201cMy father and his allegations hold no weight and are frankly transphobic and based in the notion that I am somehow incapable of coherent thought or opposing opinions to those of my own kindred worrying about my well being\u201d the post said. \u201cI am now aware of the severity of emotional and psychological manipulation I was made to endure while in my parents home.\u201d Tokata Iron Eyes added: \u201cI am an adult and I deserve to feel authority in my own body.\u201d A post shared by @tokatawinTokata Iron Eyes followed up the statement Thursday with a video posted to Instagram that responded to those who believe Miller wrote the statement instead of the teen. In the video, Tokata Iron Eyes says that the statement was written \u201cdirectly from me.\u201d \u201cNo one is controlling my Instagram account,\u201d the teen said in the video.\u201cThis is my life, these are my decisions, and I\u2019m disappointed in my parents and the press in every way,\u201d Tokata Iron Eyes concluded in the video.A judge signed the request for a protective order, which states Miller cannot have contact or harass Tokata Iron Eyes, Chase Iron Eyes and Sara Jumping Eagle or come within 100 yards of their residence.

Is this revenge for all those years of the gay boy best friend?\u201dRosin\u2019s since-deleted tweet was met with backlash. Many fans took issue with the fact that she singled out \u201cFire Island,\u201d which has been otherwise praised for its exclusively LGBTQ cast that includes many actors of color.Others felt her use of the term \u201ccute gay Asian boys\u201d to be condescending toward Booster, Ricamora and Yang.I loved FIRE ISLAND, even though it wasn\u2019t \u201cfor\u201d me or \u201cabout\u201d me and apparently doesn\u2019t pass the Bechdel test. Crazy, I know.I haven\u2019t seen #FireIslandMovie but can we not do this, please? This movie features several queer Asian men \u2014 who are vastly underrepresented in media and shown only as flat, stereotypical, supporting characters when sporadically present \u2014 as complex and nuanced leads. https://t.co/j5pLst4HduBefore long, Rosin\u2019s tweet caught the eye of comedian Margaret Cho, who has a supporting role in the film and is bisexual.\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was drab,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI don\u2019t identify as drab.

I\u2019ve read your responses and I hear you. My tweet was careless and thoughtless. Truly. The movie was telling a story about queer AAPI men, whose experiences don\u2019t show up enough in movies or anywhere else 1/3 pic.twitter.com/FEI0sDqXJe\u201cWhat I had to say was beside the point, not to mention a buzzkill on a fun summer movie,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s a cliche but the fact that I didn\u2019t see it coming means I have a lot to learn. ... The last thing I want to do is pit members of my community against each other.

When Stern asked Snoop if he specifically hired someone to roll blunts for him, the musician didn\u2019t hesitate to confirm: \u201cThat\u2019s his J-O-B \u2014 his occupation. On his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, it says, \u2019What do you do? I\u2019m a blunt roller. P-B-R, professional blunt roller,\u201d he told the host. @HowardStern @Sethrogen snoop dogg talking about his blunt roller pic.twitter.com/w4OLiXOGxVWhen it comes to knowing exactly when the hip-hop mogul needs a smoke break, Snoop added, \u201cthat motherfucker\u2019s timing is impeccable.\u201d The legendary artist, known for his unwavering love of the green bud, shared at the time that the coveted position paid around $40,000 to $50,000 annually, in addition to sweet perks, like free weed. However, after the Twitter account UberFacts tweeted on Monday, \u201cSnoop Dogg employs a full-time blunt roller who makes between $40,000 and $50,000 a year,\u201d the crip-walking West Coast lyricist swiftly stepped in to share an update. \u201cInflation. Their salary went up!!\u201d he wrote.Inflation. Their salary went up!! https://t.co/BCtOVHMN4WSnoop isn\u2019t the only rapper who\u2019s too booked to roll his own blunts. Kid Cudi, Waka Flocka Flame and G Herbo have also been vocal about their search for the perfect joint roller. The artists have yet to confirm if their employee hunt has been successful.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPostTrevante Rhodes is ready to duke it out as boxer Mike Tyson in the first footage of a new and unauthorized series about the heavyweight champion\u2019s life. Hulu on Wednesday gave fans a first look at the \u201cMoonlight\u201d actor in fighting form with the release of a teaser for \u201cMike,\u201d due out Aug. 25. The eight-episode series is billed as a \u201cno-holds-barred look\u201d at Tyson, both in and out of the ring, and promises to be \u201cone wild ride.\u201d According to press notes, \u201cMike\u201d also \u201cexamines class in America, race in America, fame and the power of media, misogyny, the wealth divide, the promise of the American Dream and ultimately our own role in shaping [Tyson\u2019s] story.\u201dCatch the teaser for \u201cMike\u201d below. By all accounts, Tyson is a divisive figure in pop culture at large. In 1992, the New York native was convicted of rape and sentenced to six years in prison, serving three. His boxing license was briefly revoked in 1997 after he bit off a part of opponent Evander Holyfield\u2019s ear during a match. From the looks of the clip, \u201cMike\u201d won\u2019t shy away from any of those controversies. And series screenwriter Steven Rogers is known for capturing the nuances of complicated athletes. His screenplay for 2017\u2019s \u201cI, Tonya,\u201d about disgraced Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding, received numerous accolades and a BAFTA Award nomination. Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, Rogers said he wanted to present Tyson as a \u201ccompelling, contradictory, and complex\u201d figure, not a heroic one. \u201cI think the thing people responded to in \u2018I, Tonya\u2019 was, we took a story everyone thought they knew and we tried to show there\u2019s much more to it than just the sound bites the media gives us,\u201d he said. \u201cIn some ways, [Tyson\u2019s life is] a cautionary tale of the American Dream.\u201d\u201cYou can find the roots of a lot of issues we\u2019re grappling with today like #MeToo, Black Lives Matter, prison reform, mental health issues in it,\u201d he added. \u201cIt seemed like a good time to tell it.\u201dSenior Culture Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

He plans to represent himself, as a matter of principle, and because: \u201cI do not want to spend several hundred thousand dollars on lawyers.\u201dSpeaking to reporters outside the courthouse, Navarro claimed the Justice Department had an \u201cutter disregard of the Constitution and the law\u201d and that authorities could have knocked on his door at home and asked him to go to court instead of arresting him while he was about to board a plane.Navarro complains that he was strip searched and denied food and water. pic.twitter.com/MAAcVHXz7WNavarro was charged with two counts of criminal contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena issued in February demanding documents and testimony regarding the Capitol attack. He has claimed he was unable to cooperate due to executive privilege and said he would not do so until that privilege was waived by \u201cthe president\u201d \u2014 referring to Trump, who can\u2019t because he is not the president.President Joe Biden has refused to grant executive privilege to those targeted by the committee probing the insurrection. Navarro\u2019s indictment marks the first time the Justice Department has pursued charges against a Trump administration official who was actively working in the White House on Jan. 6 and played a role in his crusade to overturn the 2020 election. Former White House adviser Steve Bannon was also indicted last fall for defying a subpoena. Navarro was heavily involved in Trump\u2019s scheme to stay in power and reportedly briefed Trump directly on debunked conspiracy theories about the election ahead of the Capitol attack.His complaints on Fox News about his arrest raised eyebrows online:When rightwing media relentlessly pretend traitors like Navarro are victims of prosecution remind them of their position on the treatment of George Floyd and ask them if everyone  in America is afforded the same sympathy and benefit of the doubt they reserve for fascist trumpersWhy are the elite so appalled and shocked when they are arrested and treated like...everyone else? https://t.co/JLWdF5oVfBDon't crime and this won't happen. https://t.co/N9alxK9AnlIf he followed the law to begin with he would not have been arrested.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostA visibly shaken Matthew McConaughey addressed the American people from the White House podium Tuesday, pleading for the passage of commonsense gun laws in the wake of a shooter slaughtering 19 children and two teachers in his hometown of Uvalde, Texas.The actor spoke for more than 20 minutes straight, sharing the heart-wrenching conversations he\u2019s had with the victims\u2019 families, whom he and his wife went to meet as soon as they learned of the May 24 massacre. The budding conservationist Maite Yuleana Rodriguez, a 10-year-old killed in the shooting, will never get to work toward her dream of becoming a marine biologist, McConaughey lamented. She liked to wear a pair of green Converse shoes with a heart on the toe \u2015 an emblem she drew to symbolize her love of nature. His wife, Camila Alves McConaughey, held the shoes in her lap nearby as he spoke. Matthew @McConaughey's wife Camilla holds green high-top Converse shoes of the one of the Uvalde, TX victims.\"These are the same green Converse on her feet that turned out to be the only clear evidence that could identify her after the shooting.\" pic.twitter.com/uImP8xutsn\u201cThat turned out to be the only clear evidence that could identify her after the shooting,\u201d McConaughey said, slamming his fist on the podium so hard that White House employees later checked to see if he\u2019d left a dent. The large wounds left by AR-15-style rifles, which the shooter used, mutilate bodies so badly that \u201conly DNA tests or green Converse\u201d could be used to identify the deceased, McConaughey said. The one message he heard repeatedly from the victims\u2019 families, he said, was that they wanted their loved ones\u2019 lives to matter. Doing that, McConaughey argued, requires passing \u201creasonable, practical, tactical regulations\u201d around firearms.\u201cWe need responsible gun ownership. We need background checks. We need to raise the minimum age to purchase an AR-15 rifle to 21. We need a waiting period for those rifles. We need red flag laws and consequences for those who abuse them,\u201d said McConaughey, who\u2019s considered a run for Texas governor in the past. Though the vast majority of Americans support a universal background check law for all firearm transactions, no Republicans in Congress are willing to vote on the legislation currently before them. The bill, H.R. 8, would close a loophole that lets unlicensed and private firearm sellers, such as those making transactions online or at gun shows, skip background checks. \u201cAs divided as our country is, this gun responsibility issue is one that we agree on more than we don\u2019t. It really is. ... This should not be a partisan issue. There is not a Democratic or Republican value in one single act of the shooters,\u201d McConaughey asserted Tuesday.\u201cWe\u2019ve got a chance right now to reach for and to grasp a higher ground above our political affiliations,\u201d he continued, \u201ca chance to make a choice that does more than protect your party, a chance to make a choice that protects our country now and for the next generation.\u201d Senior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Now, Matt and Ross Duffer, co-creators of the Netflix smash hit, have responded in an interview with Variety. \u201cThe honest response is, clearly like the characters in the show, we also forgot about Will\u2019s birthday,\u201d Matt Duffer said. \u201cSo the debate now is whether we adjust Will\u2019s birthday or we just let it be really sad.\u201dWhen the fourth season of the sci-fi series debuted on May 27, it didn\u2019t take fans long to notice that on the day that should have been Will\u2019s birthday, he was ignored by his best friend Mike (Finn Wolfhard), witnessed Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) assault her bully with a roller skate, and was told by his mother Joyce (Winona Ryder) that she was leaving on a last-minute trip to Alaska without any acknowledgment of his birth.Hard-core fans of the show understood Will\u2019s birthday to be March 22, due to a scene in the second season in which Joyce tells Will a personal story about his birthday to save him from the Mind Flayer\u2019s control.wait they forgot will\u2019s birthday omg :( pic.twitter.com/Lwu448JKkuFast-forward to Season 4, Episode 2. In a scene where Will, Mike and Eleven go to a skating rink, Eleven\u2019s school bullies decide to pull a cruel \u201cCarrie\u201d-esque prank on her, which they record on a camcorder. When the scene is shown from the camcorder\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s time-stamped March 22, 1986 \u2014 which means the horrible scene occurred on Will\u2019s birthday. This was a shock to fans who remembered the date. Plus, as we mentioned before, it was a bummer of a day for poor Will:the saddest shit about this stranger things season is that absolutely NO ONE remembered will's birthday.NO ONE pic.twitter.com/UwaEeay4pqStop i just realized the day mike arrived in california was will\u2019s birthday and they forgot abt it good fucking byeso not only EVERYONE forgot about will's birthday, he also had to deal with mike telling him that he ruined the day and joyce saying that she was leaving to alaska, wow well done duffer brothers you just showed that you hate your own characterstranger things continuity issues keep piling up omg. will byers has 2 diff. birthdays + the duffers forgot them both. steve was said to only play basketball but then wait a minute he was captain of the swim team too? eddy is a 4x senior but somehow was in 8th grade w/ chrissy.wait what if will looked this happy because he thought mike was going to remember his birthday? pic.twitter.com/WhcXuEr6NA\u201cIt was six years ago that I wrote that date!\u201d Ross Duffer told Variety.He later added:\u201cOf course that would mean his mom forgot his birthday! It\u2019s too mean. It was obviously a mistake, and we\u2019re sorry. We apologize to the fans.\u201dMatt Duffer said the show does not have someone making sure there are no continuity errors.\u201cYou know how George R.R. Martin has somebody \u2014 I mean, his story is more vast \u2014 and Stephen King has someone who just keeps track of this stuff?\u201d Matt Duffer said. \u201cWe need that. We don\u2019t have that.\u201dHe added:\u201cWe love Will, and I don\u2019t want people to think we don\u2019t love Will because we forgot \u2014 we do! But now we mentioned Dustin\u2019s birthday this season, so we\u2019re being very careful for people not to forget, in case the timelines\u2026\u201dThe Duffer Brothers then joked about how they could fix the continuity error by going back and dubbing in another month for Will\u2019s birthday.\u201cWe\u2019re thinking his new birthday \u2026 is going to be May 22nd, because \u2018May\u2019 can fit in Winona\u2019s mouth [in the Season 2 scene]. So that would be us George Lucas-ing the situation.\u201dSure, but don\u2019t go George Lucas-ing it too much.

Ted Cruz most notably pitched the single-door strategy to protect children from attacks by gunmen armed with assault rifles. Schools would be better protected by \u201chaving one door that goes in and out of the school [and] having armed police officers at that one door,\u201d he insisted.More than 100 trained, armed officers on the scene were unable to stop the killing of 19 children and two teachers in the attack last month at Robb Elementary school in Uvalde \u2015 Cruz\u2019s home state. It\u2019s difficult to understand how a sole officer stationed at a single entrance could have made a critical difference.States with warmer climates often have small, free-standing classroom buildings spread throughout a school campus, each with one or two entrances. That would mean armed guards or police officers would need separate security stations at each classroom door opening to the outside under Cruz\u2019s plan.Yet the \u201cstrategy\u201d has long been a talking point of the gun industry, and was pitched as a solution after an earlier Texas school mass shooting in 2018 by then-Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, said if he were mayor during a mass shooting, like the one in Uvalde, the worst part would be having to talk \u201cto families of people who have lost their loved ones, and knowing that nothing you can do will bring those loved ones back.\u201d\u201cWe have a horrific scourge of gun violence in this country, and, you know, as mayor \u2014 as every mayor is doing around the country \u2014 you take the steps that you can to reduce community violence, to invest in partnerships, to make sure that you\u2019ve taken the steps you can locally,\u201d he said.But \u201cyou\u2019re also looking at Washington to say will anything be different this time?\u201d Buttigieg noted. \u201cWill we actually acknowledge the reasons why we are the only country, the only developed country where this happens on a routine basis?\u201d Check out his comments here:\"The idea that us being the only developed country where this happens routinely...is somehow a result of the design of the doorways on our school buildings is the definition of insanity, if not the definition of denial,\" Buttigieg says on gun violence. https://t.co/82iDxTzjCT pic.twitter.com/XyDjuwN5XqTrends Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Political Reporter, HuffPostJoe Biden has played little direct role in negotiations over a possible deal on gun control, a sign of how a president who often boasted of his victories over the National Rifle Association and decades of Senate experience while campaigning is now staying away from day-to-day congressional action on some of the biggest issues of his presidency.\u201cHe wants to give it some space,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said during Thursday\u2019s press briefing, referring to the president\u2019s approach to bipartisan talks in the Senate on gun control and school safety following a racist massacre at a Buffalo, New York, supermarket and the murders of 19 children in Uvalde, Texas.The president himself, speaking to reporters on Friday morning in Delaware, made his role as a bystander to negotiations clear.\u201cMy staff is dealing and have been dealing constantly with every member of the House and Senate who is wanting to talk about guns,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a constant interchange. And I\u2019ve been constantly briefed.\u201dBiden\u2019s absence from congressional discussions on key issues has occasionally frustrated and baffled advocates, who question his strategy of allowing Congress to determine the fate of even issues central to his political identity and standing.\u201cFor someone who talked so much on the campaign trail about 30 years of experience in bringing Republicans and Democrats together, it\u2019s striking that he has not been using those years of experience, relationships and skills to encourage lawmakers to get a deal,\u201d Igor Volsky, the executive director of Guns Down America, told HuffPost. \u201cThis president does not appear to be inclined to invest real political capital to reach a deal.\u201dBiden\u2019s allies, however, insist keeping the president a few steps away is necessary to give senators in both parties the political freedom to cut a deal, and that Biden\u2019s time and capital is best used to keep Congress focused on an issue that can easily fade from the headlines.\u201cI support the bipartisan efforts that include a small group of Democrats and Republican senators trying to find a way,\u201d Biden said during his speech Thursday night, which aired on every major broadcast network and drove substantial coverage. \u201cBut my God, the fact that the majority of the Senate Republicans don\u2019t want any of these proposals even to be debated or come up for a vote, I find unconscionable.\u201dThe Senate talks, which have encouraged negotiators in both parties, are likely to result in a final deal that falls far short of what Biden has achieved in the past \u2015 a ban on assault weapons in the 1990s \u2015 or what he laid out in a Thursday-night speech calling for a host of gun control measures. Much of what Biden asked for in that speech, including a ban on assault weapons and the repeal of a liability shield for gunmakers, is off the table due to unified Republican opposition.Biden\u2019s hands-off approach to congressional action isn\u2019t limited to gun control. The president has largely removed himself from negotiations over a reconciliation package that would become his signature policy achievement if it passes, leaving its fate in the hands of Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). And Biden and the White House are not deeply involved in major antitrust legislation developed by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa).Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), the party\u2019s lead negotiator on the gun control legislation, told CNN he approved of the president\u2019s approach: \u201cThey know we need our space \u2015 so we are in regular touch with the White House, but they know that this ultimately has to be a deal in the Senate.\u201dOn the campaign trail, Biden portrayed himself as uniquely positioned to reach bipartisan deals with Republicans. Breaking from most other leading contenders for the Democratic nomination, he defended the Senate\u2019s 60-vote requirement, and said his 36 years in the Senate meant he alone could bring the parties together on major issues.Again and again, in television ads and in stump speeches, Biden cited the passage of the assault weapons ban in 1994 as evidence of his bona fides, an example of persuading key Republicans to defeat a liberal nemesis in the form of the gun lobby.\u201cAs president, he will beat the NRA again and restore the soul of this nation,\u201d a narrator promised in a Biden campaign ad that aired ahead of Nevada caucuses, the results of which provided the first glimmer of hope for the former vice president\u2019s eventual comeback in the presidential primaries.Earlier in his time in office, Biden regularly took meetings with lawmakers in both parties as he tried to craft major legislation. Most of those efforts proved fruitless: Work with moderate Republicans, including Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, to craft a bipartisan version of the American Rescue Plan went nowhere. Biden\u2019s attempts to negotiate a version of the bipartisan infrastructure law with Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) also fell short, even if a group of moderate senators later reached a deal.Most notably, Biden constantly met with nearly every stripe of Democrat while attempting to negotiate his Build Back Better package, which Manchin ultimately knifed in December. Some Biden allies believe the ultra-public nature of those negotiations \u2015 Manchin was constantly bombarded with questions in the halls of the Senate \u2015 made a deal more difficult to reach.The politically fraught nature of these negotiations only adds to the challenges. Friday\u2019s decision from Rep. Chris Jacobs (R-N.Y.) to retire just a week after endorsing a ban on assault weapons shows how Republican base voters, egged on by the gun lobby, will revolt against anything they see as restricting Second Amendment rights.Biden\u2019s direct involvement could only further polarize the issue, adding to the political risk for GOP senators involved in the talks, including Collins, John Cornyn of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. (All three were just reelected in 2020.)Public surveys continue to show stricter gun laws, especially the types of strengthened background checks and red flag laws under discussion, are popular with the public. That\u2019s led some advocates, including Volsky, to suggest Biden should begin traveling to put pressure on critical senators.\u201cAt the very least, what the White House should consider is traveling to those parts of the country and meeting with affected populations to build support and create political pressure on those lawmakers to vote the right way,\u201d Volsky said. \u201cThis is the bare minimum that we would expect on any issue.\u201dIgor Bobic contributed reporting.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 New York\u2019s legislature is poised to ban people under age 21 from buying or possessing a semi-automatic rifle, a major change to state firearm laws pushed through less than three weeks after authorities say an 18-year-old used one of the guns to kill 10 people at a supermarket in Buffalo.Formal debate on the measure was expected to begin in the state Assembly and Senate Thursday afternoon, the last scheduled day of the legislative session.The bill raising the age limit is the most significant part of a package of gun control bills announced earlier this week by Democratic legislative leaders and Gov. Kathy Hochul.New York already requires people to be 21 to possess a handgun. Younger people would still be allowed to have other types of rifles and shotguns, but the change in the law would restrict ownership of the type of fast-firing rifles used by the 18-year-old gunmen in the mass shootings in Buffalo and at a Texas elementary school.Besides raising the legal purchase age to 21, the bill would also require anyone buying a semiautomatic rifle to get a license \u2014 something now only required for handguns.The change would largely impact areas outside of New York City, which already requires permits to possess, carry and purchase any type of firearm and prohibits most applicants under 21.Elsewhere in New York, people as young as 16 can possess long guns like rifles and shotguns without a license.New York would join a handful of states \u2014 including Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Vermont and Washington - that require buyers to be at least 21 instead of 18 to purchase some types of long guns. Similar legislation has been proposed in Utah.California\u2019s attempt to raise the legal buying age for a semiautomatic weapons has been challenged in court.On May 11, a U.S. Appeals court panel ruled 2-1 that the state\u2019s ban on the sale of semiautomatic weapons to adults under 21 is unconstitutional. The two judges who ruled in the majority were part of Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s wave of conservative-approved nominees that reshaped the famously liberal court.The National Rifle Association is also challenging Florida\u2019s ban on the sale of rifles to adults under age 21, which was passed in the wake of a 2018 shooting that killed 17 students and staff at a high school in Parkland.Semiautomatic rifles automatically load each bullet after firing, although firing requires pulling the trigger for each round. That makes it possible for mass murderers to kill more people in a short amount of time.Another bill set to pass in New York would require new guns to be equipped with microstamping technology, which would allow law enforcement investigators to more easily link weapons to fired bullets.The state is also expected to pass legislation that would restrict the purchase of body armor and expand the list of people who can apply for an extreme risk protection order, a court order that can temporarily prohibit someone from purchasing or possessing a firearm if they are believed to be a danger to themselves or others.Nick Langworthy, chair of the state Republican Party, said he opposes the bills for failing to address mental health, school security and crime.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostAn interview that was intended to be funny quickly turned disturbing.The Good Liars \u2014 a progressive comedy duo that typically plays pranks on conservatives and interviews people at far-right political rallies \u2014 went to the National Rifle Association\u2019s annual convention last weekend in Houston.While there, one member of the Good Liars, Jason Selvig, was interviewing people in attendance when he approached a man wearing a Confederate flag T-shirt that said \u201cKeep It Flying.\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to keep it flying?\u201d Selvig asked the man. At the NRA Conference, we asked a guy in confederate flag shirt if he was pro or anti-slavery. pic.twitter.com/oSDPnppZNs\u201cWhy would anyone want to erase our heritage?\u201d the man responded.Selvig was quick to point out that many would say that the flag symbolizes racism and slavery. \u201cAnd they may have some valid points there,\u201d Selvig told the man.The man responded by saying that associating the Confederate flag with slavery was merely an opinion. \u201cThey\u2019re welcome to that opinion if they want it,\u201d he said.In a presumed attempt to get the man to see his reasoning, Selvig then asked him if he was \u201cpro-slavery.\u201d\u201cNo comment,\u201d the man said. \u201cBut thank you for the interview.\u201dAs the man began to walk away, Selvig reached for him and said: \u201cI\u2019ll give you one more chance \u2014 pro- or anti-slavery?\u201d\u201cNo comment,\u201d the man said again. Selvig looked flabbergasted.\u201cI\u2019ll give you one more opportunity,\u201d Selvig said as the man began to shake his head, \u201cto say if you\u2019re pro- or anti-slavery.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t \u2026 no comment,\u201d the man said and walked away.The man\u2019s argument that the flag represents his Southern heritage is nothing new. The Confederate flag is thought by some to be a tribute to the \u201cLost Cause\u201d \u2014 the belief that Confederacy fought not to uphold slavery but to protect states\u2019 rights and preserve a genteel way of life for white landowners \u2014 was created by white Southerns shortly after their 1865 defeat in the Civil War. It was an attempt to give the South\u2019s role, and the thousands of Confederate soldiers who died, a more positive light, according to National Geographic.And although some states in the South view the flag as an emblem of pride, it didn\u2019t become popular until \u201cthe 1940s and 1950s as part of a massive resistance campaign against the civil rights movement,\u201d Matthew Guterl, a professor of Africana and American studies at Brown University, told The Washington Post in 2015.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t exist in our national popular culture without this moment,\u201d Guterl said. \u201cWhen African Americans fought for their equality \u2026 the battle flag was recovered and redeployed as a symbol of opposition to it.\u201dHe added: \u201cWhat was once a very blatant, full-throated defense of white supremacy has now become this gesture to heritage and history that is presented as though it has nothing to do with the civil rights movement.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Jada Pinkett Smith turned her husband\u2019s Oscar-night blowup into a teachable moment about alopecia areata, the hair-loss disorder affecting her and millions of others that, in some cases, can impact a person\u2019s sense of identity.\u201cConsidering what I\u2019ve been through with my own health and what happened at the Oscars, thousands have reached out to me with their stories,\u201d Pinkett Smith said on Wednesday\u2019s episode of \u201cRed Table Talk.\u201dThe actor said she chose to use \u201cthis moment to give our alopecia family an opportunity to talk about what it\u2019s like to have this condition\u201d and what it is. Her guests included the mother of a 12-year-old girl, Rio Allred, who was bullied over her hair loss and died by suicide, and a physician who explained the different types of the disorder.Before tackling the subject, Pinkett Smith addressed events at the March 27 Academy Awards. She and husband Will Smith, a best-actor nominee, were in the audience as presenter Chris Rock cracked a joke at Pinkett Smith\u2019s expense.\u201cJada, I love you. \u2018G.I. Jane 2,\u2019 can\u2019t wait to see it,\u201d Rock said.Pinkett Smith, who has spoken publicly about her alopecia, had a closely shaved head similar to that of Demi Moore in the 1997 movie.Smith strode from his front-row seat to the stage and slapped Rock, shocking the comedian and the audience. Smith, who returned to his seat and later accepted the Oscar for \u201cKing Richard,\u201d subsequently apologized to Rock but was banned from the ceremony for 10 years by the film academy.\u201cNow, about Oscar night, my deepest hope is that these two intelligent, capable men have an opportunity to heal, talk this out, and reconcile,\u201d Pinkett Smith said on \u201cRed Table Talk\u201d in an indirect reference to Smith and Rock. \u201cThe state of the world today, we need them both, and we all actually need one another more than ever.\u201cUntil then, Will and I are continuing to do what we have done for the last 28 years, and that\u2019s keep figuring out this thing called life together,\u201d said Pinkett Smith, who previously had addressed the incident in a brief Instagram post that read \u201cThis is a season for healing and I\u2019m here for it.\u201dThe actor (\u201cGirls Trip,\u201d \u201cMatrix\u201d films), who hosts the Facebook Watch talk show with her daughter, Willow, and Adrienne Banfield Norris, her mother, said that millions of people are living with alopecia and what she called the \u201cshame\u201d that surrounds it.The condition, particularly for Black women, can affect a person\u2019s perception of themselves and force them to frequently confront others\u2019 perceptions about beauty, hair and race and culture.Rio\u2019s mother, Nicole Ball, recounted the impact of the Oscar incident, which took place less than two weeks after her daughter\u2019s death.\u201cWhat is the universe doing right now?

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Trends Reporter, HuffPostLeVar Burton is opening up about not snagging the \u201cJeopardy!\u201d hosting job after campaigning for Alex Trebek\u2019s role. The legendary \u201cReading Rainbow\u201d alum recently appeared on Newsy\u2019s \u201cIn The Loop\u201d to share how not being chosen for the permanent hosting position left him feeling \u201cwrecked.\u201d\u201cExperiencing a very public defeat \u2014 humiliation, if you will \u2014 was sobering. And what I learned from the experience, really, is that it reinforced my belief that everything happens for a reason, even if you cannot discern the reason in the moment,\u201d Burton said.Burton, who\u2019s a longtime fan of the classic game show, believes that he would\u2019ve been the perfect person to take the reins as the new host. \u201cIn the fullness of time, everything will be revealed. And like I said, it was I think in that first week of feeling really sort of not just disappointed, but wrecked,\u201d Burton told Newsy. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that I would not be their choice for host.\u201d\u201cThe truth is it was my favorite game show. It really was. I mean, I watched that show since I was in the third grade and Art Fleming was the host,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I honestly thought that I was well-suited for it. As it turns out, it really wasn\u2019t a competition, after all \u2014 the fix was in.\u201dBurton, who\u2019s spent nearly five decades in the public eye, was such an overwhelming fan favorite to succeed longtime host Trebek that a Change.org petition garnered nearly 300,000 signatures in support. The veteran actor even earned an endorsement from actor Ryan Reynolds.Though he didn\u2019t land the permanent gig, Burton was among the many celebrities who stepped in as guest host for a week in 2021 after Trebek died of pancreatic cancer in 2020.Burton wasn\u2019t the only person in the running for the position. Actor Mayim Bialik, \u201cJeopardy!\u201d alum Ken Jennings and the show\u2019s executive producer Mike Richards were also among those eyed for the role. Hosting duties are now shared by Bialik and Jennings.Although he was disappointed to miss out on the hosting gig, the actor has made plans to continue pursuing his dream of becoming a game show host. Burton, who is best known for his roles as Kunta Kinte in \u201cRoots,\u201d Geordi La Forge in \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation\u201d and as the longtime host of \u201cReading Rainbow,\u201d shared that other opportunities have blossomed for him \u2014 namely, his upcoming role as creator and host of a new game show inspired by Hasbro\u2019s Trivial Pursuit board game.\u201cThe doors have been opened. Windows have been opened. The phone hasn\u2019t stopped ringing, and I never would have experienced those things that I\u2019m experiencing, like hosting the Scripps Spelling Bee, had I gotten that job,\u201d Burton said.He added: \u201cSo I think it was a big lesson for me and just being willing to sit in the discomfort long enough to find out what was really supposed to happen for me around this game show thing.\u201dNot getting the role has taught the actor \u201cvaluable lessons,\u201d including the importance of believing in and \u201cbetting\u201d on yourself. \u201cI believe I\u2019m still mining some of the takeaways from that experience,\u201d he said.Burton is set to host the 2022 Scripps National Spelling Bee.

After decades of decline in the United States, unions may be poised for a comeback.Every month seems to bring more promising news for organized labor. Workers at Starbucks have organized roughly 100 stores from coast to coast since last fall. REI employees formed the outdoor retailer\u2019s very first union. Amazon employees defied all the odds and won an 8,000-worker union election in New York City. And an Apple Store in Towson, Maryland, became the first to unionize last month. Just 1 in 10 U.S. workers now belongs to a union, down from roughly 1 in 3 in the period following World War II. Yet the labor movement is showing more muscle now than it has in years. Emboldened by a tight labor market and two years of toiling through a pandemic, workers are succeeding in organizing companies that have staunchly resisted unionization, and many of them are doing it practically on their own. HuffPost is gathering some of them together to explain how and why they did it.On July 20, workers from the Amazon, Starbucks, REI and Apple unions are taking part in a HuffPost panel discussion called \u201cA New Labor Movement,\u201d moderated by our labor reporter, Dave Jamieson. The workers are talking about the roots of their organizing campaigns, the connections they forged with their coworkers and the tactics they used to defeat the anti-union campaigns waged by their employers.All these companies have opposed their employees\u2019 effort to organize, each in their own way. Starbucks has flooded stores with managers and been accused of retaliating against union activists. Amazon has spent millions of dollars on high-priced anti-union consultants. REI has brandished its progressive image in hopes of diluting union support. And an Apple executive sent out a video to tens of thousands of retail workers discouraging them from unionizing. Organizers will share their stories of battling powerful companies from the inside, often at great personal risk, and their views of where the U.S. labor movement is headed.The event will be at 5:30 p.m. on July 20 at the BuzzFeed offices in New York City. Speakers will include Angelika Maldonado, vice president of the Amazon Labor Union; Reese Mercado and CJ Toothman, member of Starbucks Workers United; Emma Kate Harris, REI worker and member of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union; and Billy Jarboe, Apple Store worker and member of the International Associations of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.You can also view the livestream on our Facebook page.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Trends Reporter, HuffPostGeorgia District Attorney Fani Willis is armed with powerfully damaging information on Donald Trump amid a special grand jury probe that could make her the first official to prove the former president had criminal intent when attempting to overturn the 2020 election results, according to a former federal prosecutor.To charge Trump with a crime, Willis will \u201cneed what everyone else who is investigating the former president\u2019s involvement in election fraud or outright election criminality needs \u2014 proof of the former president\u2019s state of mind,\u201d Joyce Vance, a former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cThe Katie Phang Show\u201d Sunday.Willis \u201chas a good case walking in the door to that grand jury because she\u2019s got the tape\u201d of Trump soliciting votes after the election, Vance added.Trump called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger ahead of the official vote certification, telling him to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to change his loss to Joe Biden in the state into a victory. \u201cFellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break,\u201d Trump pleaded on the call, which Raffensperger recorded.The call is particularly damning, Vance said, because Trump is \u201casking not for an investigation into potential voting fraud, not for a look to see whether something went wrong, but he\u2019s asking\u201d Raffensperger simply to \u201cfind him the specific number of votes that he needs\u201d to make him a winner.\u201cThat\u2019s pretty good evidence of criminal intent walking into it,\u201d and Willis will rely on witnesses to \u201cput some flesh on the bones,\u201d Vance added.While Trump\u2019s phone call launched the Georgia probe into election interference, the investigation has now been expanded into include possible racketeering and fraud linked to a number of efforts by Republicans to upend the election.A key focus will be the slate of fake electors Republicans created, aiming to substitute them for the state\u2019s legitimate electors. Trump\u2019s former personal attorney Rudy Giuliani was deeply involved in that scheme. As many as 50 witnesses are expected to be called before the grand jury. Raffensperger, fresh from his GOP primary victory for secretary of state despite fierce opposition from Trump, is slated to testify Thursday.Trump is not happy about any of it, according to recent posts on Truth Social.Trends Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) on Sunday called on fellow Republicans to come to the table to find \u201creasonable solutions\u201d to the nation\u2019s gun epidemic, with the Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran saying raising the age limit to purchase a gun is a \u201cno-brainer.\u201d\u201cAs a person that appreciates and believes in the second amendment, we have to be the ones putting forward reasonable solutions to gun violence,\u201d he said in an interview with ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d following two recent mass shootings by teenagers in Texas and New York.Kinzinger has previously opposed a ban on assault weapons, but on Sunday told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash he\u2019s \u201copen to one now\u201d \u2015 though he appeared to lean toward implementing other safeguards first.The congressman suggested that people could obtain a special license or go through training to own a semi-automatic rifle like the AR-15, which has become the go-to firearm for recent mass shootings. He also called for raising the age to purchase a firearm from 18 to 21, pointing out that the gunmen in last week\u2019s Uvalde shooting, the Buffalo shooting and the 2018 Parkland, Florida, shooting, would have all been stopped from legally obtaining a firearm if such a law were in place.Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger tells @jonkarl that raising minimum age for gun purchases to 21 \u201cis a no brainer\" to him.\u201cIf you look at the Parkland shooting, you look at Buffalo, you look at this shooting, these are people under the age of 21.\u201d https://t.co/Ndo3NsrFp7 pic.twitter.com/mBpxDBiyJF\u201cI think that raising the age of gun purchase to 21 is a no-brainer,\u201d he told ABC News\u2019 Jonathan Karl. \u201cWe just raised without really so much as a blink the age of purchasing cigarettes federally to 21. I think we need to get there eventually.\u201dNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) last week proposed a similar age restriction for her own state in the wake of the Buffalo shooting. Such a proposal is easier said than done, however, with federal courts in recent years ruling that such age limits are unconstitutional.Kinzinger also dismissed adding more guns to schools as a means to keep students safe.\u201cIf we think that just hardening schools or reducing \u2015 basically turning schools into military camps is going to be the answer, even if it does work, which it won\u2019t, but even if it does, that\u2019s not the kind of country I want to live in, right?\u201d he said. \u201cI got a kid that\u2019s 4 months old now, will be going to school someday. I don\u2019t want to have to have a military I.D. to check him into the front gate of his elementary school.\u201dFormer President Donald Trump on Friday recommended that all schools have strong fencing, metal detectors, an on-duty police official or armed guard and a single point of entry. He also suggested eliminating \u201cgun-free school zones\u201d so staff can be armed. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas last week also said schools should have fewer doorways and armed police officers stationed at the entrance.\u201cAs the age-old saying goes, the only way to stop a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,\u201d Trump said.Rep. Adam Kinzinger on calls from his party to \"harden\" schools: \"Turning schools into military camps ... even if it does work, which it won't, but even if it does, that's not the kind of country I want to live in ... they're scared to talk about [the gun issue].\" pic.twitter.com/5TfGkpuysnKinzinger dismissed that saying, however, pointing out that the gunman in last week\u2019s shooting was grossly outnumbered by law enforcement but still managed to kill 21 people.\u201cThere were 150 good guys with guns at this shooting that didn\u2019t do anything until, basically, Border Patrol SWAT showed up,\u201d he told CNN during an interview on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWe have got to take handle of this, man. This is insane.\u201dKinzinger said he\u2019s heard from fellow Republicans who privately agree with him on changing gun laws to curb violence, but \u201cthey won\u2019t say it\u201d publicly out of fear of being branded an opponent of gun rights.\u201cYou\u2019re going to get a bunch of attacks that say, you\u2019re crazy, it\u2019s my right, the Second Amendment, even though we all believe in the Second Amendment.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 The victory party took on the feel of an evangelical worship service after Doug Mastriano won Pennsylvania\u2019s Republican gubernatorial primary this month. As a Christian singer led the crowd in song, some raised their arms toward the heavens in praise.Mastriano opened his remarks by evoking Scripture: \u201cGod uses the foolish to confound the wise.\u201d He claimed Pennsylvanians\u2019 freedom would be \u201csnatched away\u201d if his Democratic opponent wins in November, and cast the election in starkly religious terms with another biblical reference: \u201cLet\u2019s choose this day to serve the Lord.\u201dMastriano, a state senator and retired Army colonel, has not only made faith central to his personal story but has woven conservative Christian beliefs and symbols into the campaign \u2014 becoming the most prominent example this election cycle of what some observers call a surge of Christian nationalism among Republican candidates.Mastriano \u2014 who has ignored repeated requests for comment from The Associated Press, including through his campaign last week \u2014 has rejected the \u201cChristian nationalist\u201d label in the past. In fact, few if any prominent candidates use the label. Some say it\u2019s a pejorative and insist everyone has a right to draw on their faith and values to try to influence public policy.But scholars generally define Christian nationalism as going beyond policy debates and championing a fusion of American and Christian values, symbols and identity.Christian nationalism, they say, is often accompanied by a belief that God has destined America, like the biblical Israel, for a special role in history, and that it will receive divine blessing or judgment depending on its obedience.That often overlaps with the conservative Christian political agenda, including opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and transgender rights. Researchers say Christian nationalism is often also associated with mistrust of immigrants and Muslims. Many Christian nationalists see former President Donald Trump as a champion despite his crude sexual boasts and lack of public piety.Candidates seen as Christian nationalists have had mixed success in this year\u2019s Republican primaries, which typically pitted staunch conservatives against opponents even further to the right.There were losses by some high-profile candidates, such as U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn and an Idaho gubernatorial hopeful, Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin. The former spoke of a \u201cspiritual battle\u201d on Capitol Hill and a need for \u201cstrong, God-fearing patriots.\u201d The latter was photographed holding a gun and a Bible and said, \u201cGod calls us to pick up the sword and fight, and Christ will reign in the state of Idaho.\u201dSome of Idaho\u2019s Republican primaries for the Legislature were won by candidates touting Christian values or sharing priorities with Christian nationalists, such as sports bans for transgender athletes. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who uses biblical phrasing to \u201cbe a watchman on the wall\u201d against those seeking to \u201cdestroy our faith,\u201d easily won her primary.Watchers of Christian nationalism consider Mastriano\u2019s win \u2014 in a rout, with 44% in a crowded field despite opposition from the state party establishment \u2014 by far the highest-profile victory for the movement.Mastriano has called the separation of church and state a \u201cmyth.\u201dAfter his victory, the comments section of his campaign Facebook page had the feel of a revival tent:\u201cPraise Jesus!\u201d \u201cGod is smiling on us and sending His blessings.\u201d \u201cThank you Father God!!\u201dMastriano \u201cis a unique case where he really does in his speeches highlight this apocalyptic idea\u201d where his supporters and causes are on God\u2019s side, said Andrew Whitehead, sociology professor at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and co-author of \u201cTaking America Back for God: Christian Nationalism in the United States.\u201d\u201cIt literally is good and evil,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s no room for compromise, so that is the threat to democracy.\u201dIn the book, Whitehead and co-author Samuel Perry measured rates of Christian nationalism by drawing on a 2017 Baylor University survey. It gauged opinions on such things as America\u2019s role in God\u2019s plan and whether the U.S. should be declared a Christian nation, advance biblical values and allow school prayer and religious displays in public places.Their research found about one in five Americans align with many of those views. That\u2019s down from nearly one in four a decade earlier, just as Americans have become less religious overall. But Whitehead said Christian nationalists, who are more numerous among Republicans, can be expected to maintain their fervor.Christian nationalism is emerging alongside and in some cases overlapping with other right-wing movements, such as the conspiratorial QAnon, white supremacy, and denialism over COVID-19 and the 2020 election. Christian prayers and symbols featured prominently in and around the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection there.Mastriano, who sought to overturn Pennsylvania\u2019s vote for Joe Biden in 2020, attended the rally preceding the attack and chartered buses to bring others. Though he says he left when things turned violent, video showed he passed through \u201cbreached barricades and police lines,\u201d according to a Senate Judiciary Committee report.Robert Jones, CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, said those Jan. 6 displays were not surprising.According to a recent survey by the institute, white evangelical Christians were among the strongest supporters of the assertion that God intended America as a \u201cpromised land\u201d for European Christians. Those who backed that idea were far more likely to agree that \u201ctrue American patriots may have to resort to violence ... to save our country.\u201d\u201cTo my mind, white Christian nationalism is really the threat,\u201d Jones said.Conservative Christian themes are also playing a role in local elections, including in blue states, although many proponents say they view it not as nationalism but as supporting their religious freedom and values.Pastor Tim Thompson of 412 Church in Murrieta, California, who hosts a YouTube channel with more than 9,600 subscribers and envisions a conservative future for the state, recently started a political action committee aiming to \u201ctake back our school boards\u201d and give parents authority over curriculum.\u201cWe don\u2019t want teachers or any other adults talking to our kids about sex,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want teachers categorizing our kids into oppressed or oppressor. These are not political issues. They are moral and biblical issues.\u201dJudeo-Christian values are the foundation of America, he argued.\u201cPeople are afraid to speak up for these values because they are afraid that the left is going to slap a label like \u2018racist\u2019 or \u2018Christian nationalist\u2019 on them,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI don\u2019t care about those labels, because my wife, children, church and community know who I am.\u201dPastor Jack Hibbs of Calvary Chapel Chino Hills in Chino Hills, California, has also sought to influence local elections.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 A federal court panel on Friday ordered Ohio to hold an Aug. 2 primary using the third set of Statehouse maps approved by the Ohio Redistricting Commission, despite a rebuke of the plan by the state\u2019s high court.The court acted after giving Ohio a Saturday deadline to come up with a new map for legislative districts, a divided three-judge panel of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio said in its ruling.That deadline will be missed, as the GOP-controlled commission did not schedule any meetings.\u201cWe recognized from the outset that choosing a remedy would be challenging,\u201d Circuit Judge Amul Thapar said in the 2-1 majority opinion.\u201cAnd between the standoff among state officials and the delay in getting the case, our options were limited,\u201d Thapar wrote. \u201cSo we chose the best of our bad options.\u201dThe federal court\u2019s decision came in a lawsuit brought by a group of Republican voters that initially sought to salvage legislative primaries scheduled for May 3 by using the commission\u2019s third set of district lines, which also was found unconstitutional.BREAKING: Federal court orders Ohio to implement state legislative district maps that were ruled unconstitutional by the Ohio Supreme Court pic.twitter.com/HM6aKjDufjFriday\u2019s ruling was a victory for that GOP group, as well as for the Republican-dominated redistricting commission, which passed five straight sets of legislative maps that couldn\u2019t meet constitutional muster.A directive to the state\u2019s 88 elections board regarding the primary will be sent Saturday, said Rob Nichols, spokesperson for Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose, the state\u2019s elections chief and a member of the redistricting commission.Federal Judge Algenon Marbley dissented in Friday\u2019s ruling, pointing out that the state Supreme Court reiterated this week that the third map remains unconstitutional.The best option remained the map drawn by two experts, one selected by Republicans, one by Democrats, Marbley said.The two men \u2014 Douglas Johnson, president of National Demographics Corporation, and Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political science professor \u2014 were nearly finished when the commission suddenly set aside their work and passed a different map. The two had been paid $450 an hour for the previous four days to draw new maps in work viewed step-by-step online.Ohio\u2019s map fight comes amid the once-per-decade political mapmaking process that all states must undertake to reflect population changes from the census. A combination of Republican foot-dragging and legal wrangling has extended redistricting well into the 2022 election season and stymied Ohio\u2019s legislative primaries. Maps were supposed to be completed last fall.A 2015 constitutional amendment, passed overwhelmingly by voters, required the commission to at least attempt to avoid partisan favoritism and to try to proportionally distribute districts to reflect Ohio\u2019s political makeup, which is split at about 54% Republican, 46% Democrat.Republican commissioners have argued the set of maps they resubmitted to the court most recently met those requirements. By GOP calculations, the boundaries would create a 54-45 Republican majority in the Ohio House and an 18-15 Republican majority in Ohio Senate. Democrats have challenged their numbers, saying many districts counted in Democrats\u2019 column are very closely divided.Both LaRose and the association representing election officials in Ohio\u2019s 88 counties, who administer elections, previously said they wanted the legislative primaries to be held Aug. 2.The court\u2019s Friday decision was disappointing, said state Sen. Vernon Sykes, an Akron Democrat and redistricting commission co-chair. But he noted the ruling only affects elections this year.\u201cThe Ohio Redistricting Commission still has the responsibility to draw fair, constitutional maps for the rest of the decade and I will continue to work toward that goal,\u201d Sykes said.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy is making it clear that he will likely defy a subpoena from the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, escalating a standoff with the panel over his and other GOP lawmakers\u2019 testimony.In an 11-page letter to the panel Friday, an attorney for McCarthy argued that the select committee does not have the authority to issue subpoenas to the lawmakers under House rules and demanded answers to a series of questions and documents if his client were to comply.Attorney Elliot Berke requested a list of \u201ctopics that the Select Committee would like to discuss with the Leader, and the constitutional and legal rationale justifying the request.\u201d\u201cI expressly reserve Leader McCarthy\u2019s right to assert any other applicable privilege or objection to the Select Committee\u2019s subpoena,\u201d Berke wrote.Committee spokesperson Tim Mulvey responded Friday evening: \u201cLeader McCarthy and other Members who have been served subpoenas are hiding behind debunked arguments and baseless requests for special treatment.\u201dHe added, \u201cThe refusal of these Members to cooperate is a continued assault on the rule of law and sets a dangerous new precedent that could hamper the House\u2019s ability to conduct oversight in the future.\u201d Mulvey said committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) \u201cwill formally respond to these Members in the days ahead.\u201dThe House panel believes testimony from the Republican lawmakers is crucial to their investigation as each of the men was in contact with then-President Donald Trump and his allies in the weeks and days leading up to the Capitol insurrection. Some participated in meetings and urged the White House to try to overturn the 2020 presidential results.McCarthy has acknowledged he spoke with Trump on Jan. 6 as Trump\u2019s supporters were beating police outside the Capitol and forcing their way into the building. But he has not shared many details. The committee requested information about his conversations with Trump \u201cbefore, during and after\u201d the riot.His apparent defiance presents a new challenge for the committee after lawmakers decided to take the extraordinary and politically risky step of subpoenaing their own colleagues.\u201cFor House Republican leaders to agree to participate in this political stunt would change the House forever,\u201d the California lawmaker wrote Thursday in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal with GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio.The committee now must decide whether to enforce the subpoenas even as it looks to wrap up the investigation and prepare for a series of public hearings in early June. It could refer the lawmakers to the House ethics committee or take steps to hold them in contempt.The subpoenas were issued to McCarthy, Jordan, and Reps. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania, Andy Biggs of Arizona and Mo Brooks of Alabama in mid-May. The panel has already interviewed more than 1,000 witnesses and collected more than 100,000 documents as it investigates the worst attack on the Capitol in two centuries.\u201cI have no relevant information that would advance any legitimate legislative purpose,\u201d Jordan said in a letter detailing his reasons for not cooperating. The others indicated after the subpoenas were issued that they too would not cooperate.Perry\u2019s lawyer sent the committee a letter earlier this week saying he could \u201cnot in good conscience comply\u201d with the subpoena because he does not believe it is valid under House rules.Requests for comment from Biggs and Brooks were not immediately returned.The panel had previously asked for voluntary cooperation from the five lawmakers, along with a handful of other GOP members, but all refused to speak with the panel, which debated for months whether to issue the subpoenas.McCarthy and the others were summoned to testify in front of investigators this week and next week. McCarthy, who aspires to be House speaker if Republicans take over the majority next year, indicated that the committee\u2019s decision will have a lasting impact.\u201cEvery representative in the minority would be subject to compelled interrogations by the majority, under oath, without any foundation of fairness, and at the expense of taxpayers,\u201d he wrote in the op-ed.In a separate move, McCarthy and the No. 2 House Republican, Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, filed a court brief in support of Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon, who is facing criminal contempt charges for defying a subpoena from the committee. In the brief, lawyers for the two write that the committee does not have the authority to issue subpoenas, an argument that has been dismissed in other court proceedings.The lawyers also wrote that McCarthy and Scalise filed the brief \u201cout of concern for the potential damage to House institutional\u201d rules and order.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPostGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp cruised to an easy victory Tuesday, winning the Republican nomination in his bid for reelection by handily defeating the challenger that former President Donald Trump had recruited to end Kemp\u2019s political career for refusing to overturn Trump\u2019s 2020 election loss in the state.Trump, who tried to overthrow American democracy in a last-ditch attempt to remain in power after the 2020 election, had made Kemp his top target in his effort to punish Republicans who did not support those efforts.He talked former U.S. Sen. David Perdue into getting into the race, persuaded another supporter to run for a congressional race instead of governor to clear the field for Perdue, and staged two rallies for him in addition to spending millions from his own political committee on Perdue\u2019s behalf, something he has not done for any other candidate.Despite this, Kemp won with a staggering margin of victory over Perdue, 73% to 22%, with 82% of the vote counted.That margin is well over the simple majority he needed to avoid a runoff next month. He will now face Democrat Stacey Abrams, who had no significant opposition in her primary, in the November general election \u2014 a rematch of the 2018 race, when he narrowly defeated her in a year that Democrats did well across the country.Kemp had been secretary of state, in charge of administering elections, for nine years prior to his 2018 run for governor, and Abrams accused him of using his position to help himself win by suppressing the vote of her supporters.Kemp said in a news conference Monday that he has been expecting a tough reelection race ever since.He incurred Trump\u2019s wrath in November and December of 2020 when he refused Trump\u2019s demands that he somehow reverse Trump\u2019s 11,779-vote loss in Georgia by calling a special legislative session so lawmakers could nevertheless award Trump the state\u2019s 16 electoral votes.Trump\u2019s ire hurt Kemp\u2019s standing with some Georgia Republicans, but most approved of his end to business COVID shutdowns, his reopening of schools, his tax cuts and his \u201cheartbeat\u201d abortion law.At the Monday news conference \u2015 just hours before a final pre-election rally with former Vice President Mike Pence, with whom Trump is also angry for refusing to help him remain in office despite losing \u2014 Kemp said he understands that Trump could continue to attack him in the general election campaign, but that is something he has no ability to influence.\u201cI had a great relationship with President Trump,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cI\u2019ve never said anything bad about him. I don\u2019t plan on doing that. I\u2019m not mad at him. I think he\u2019s just mad at me.

What they need is uplifting from all of our fellow Texans and all of our fellow Americans.\u201dGovernor Abbott says, \"it could have been worse.\"A lot of people talking about this line in our comment section right now. Abbott is giving an update on the Uvalde school shooting in Texas that left 19 students, 2 adults and the gunman deceased. https://t.co/h3EO8HDla8 pic.twitter.com/MQIzWc9uZ8\u201cThe reality is, as horrible as what happened, it could have been worse,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThe reason it was not worse is because law enforcement officials did what they do: They showed amazing courage by running toward gun fire for the singular purpose of trying to save lives.\u201dThe lone gunman, who authorities said purchased two firearms and hundreds of rounds of ammunition last week ahead of the attack, was briefly stopped by responding law enforcement after arriving outside the school. He exchanged gunfire with the officers but was still able to enter a fourth-grade classroom, barricade the door, and continue shooting.When it comes to stopping or slowing future violent acts, Abbott said, the focus should not be on gun control. Instead, he said he wants to make sure \u201cthat everybody in this community has the access they need, for as long as they need it, to address the mental, emotional health care needs that they have.\u201dHowever, he also said he would not reconsider accepting federal funds to expand Medicaid to address the issue. Abbott said 18-year-olds in Texas have been able to buy guns for 60 years. He also dismissed the relevancy of prior school shootings in his state, saying that \u201cfor the majority of those 60 years we do not have school shootings.\u201dIn 2018, a 17-year-old gunman fatally shot 10 people and wounded 13 others at a high school in Santa Fe. Another shooting at an El Paso Walmart in 2020 killed 23 people and wounded 23 others, and a mass shooting in Midland and Odessa killed seven people and injured more than 20 others in 2019.At the time of the Santa Fe attack, Abbott pledged to work with state legislators to look into solutions to gun violence. He went on to sign laws that would boost mental health resources and give teachers more access to guns on public school campuses.Although Abbott made it clear that his office\u2019s focus will not be on gun restrictions in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s tragedy, lawmakers in other states have vowed to clamp down.New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) said Wednesday that she wants to raise the minimum age to purchase an AR-15-style rifle in her state from 18 to 21. The gunman in a mass shooting at a supermarket in Buffalo earlier this month was also 18 and purchased an AR-15; 10 people were killed and three others were wounded. Abbott dismissed other states\u2019 gun laws when asked about them.\u201cI hate to say it, but there are more people who are shot every weekend in Chicago than there are in schools in Texas,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a real solution, Chicago teaches that what you\u2019re talking about is not a real solution.

Fellow mercenary Lloyd Hansen (Evans) is tasked with leading the global manhunt to find him, while racking up a high body count along the way.\u201cIf you wanna make an omelette, you gotta kill some people,\u201d Evans, clearly enjoying playing against the Captain America type, says in the trailer.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to find somebody at Chris Evans\u2019 level to step into a villain,\u201d Joe Russo told Entertainment Weekly about casting the Marvel star. \u201cIt\u2019s why you traditionally don\u2019t get a Ryan Gosling versus Chris Evans movie.

As a result of the court\u2019s ruling, death sentences remain intact for Barry Lee Jones, a man with a credible innocence claim, and for David Martinez Ramirez, who may have an intellectual disability that would disqualify him from the death penalty. More broadly, the court set a new precedent that chokes off an important avenue for people arguing they were poorly served by bad lawyers. If an individual has an ineffective lawyer at trial and then subsequently ends up with another ineffective lawyer who fails to argue that their client had ineffective counsel at trial, that individual may have no way of ever raising the issue in court.Federal habeas review, through which a federal court can review the legality of an individual\u2019s incarceration, is supposed to be a safeguard against unfair outcomes in state court, but the Supreme Court has increasingly chipped away at those protections. The stakes are particularly high for people facing capital punishment. Despite the common misconception that people on death row represent the \u201cworst of the worst,\u201d they are usually people who have dealt with abuse, poverty, intellectual disabilities or untreated mental illness. They often rely on court-appointed attorneys, many of whom are ill-equipped to handle death penalty litigation. \u201cThis decision is perverse. It is illogical,\u201d Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan. \u201cThe Court\u2019s decision thus reduces to rubble many habeas petitioners\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights to the effective assistance of counsel,\u201d Sotomayor continued. The Supreme Court ruling in Shinn v. Ramirez involves the separate cases of Jones and Ramirez, both of whom were convicted and sentenced to death in Arizona. Both men received abysmal legal assistance during their trials. During state post-conviction proceedings \u2014 the time to raise ineffective assistance of counsel claims \u2014 both of their lawyers failed to do so. Because of this, Jones and Ramirez sought relief in federal court. \u201cThe Court\u2019s decision thus reduces to rubble many habeas petitioners\u2019 Sixth Amendment rights to the effective assistance of counsel.\u201dThere are extensive procedural barriers to raising issues in federal court that have not already been raised in state court. But a 2012 Supreme Court decision called Martinez v. Ryan created a narrow exception for people like Jones and Ramirez, who had ineffective lawyers at both trial and state post-conviction proceedings.For Jones, this meant the chance to present evidence of his innocence, which led to his conviction being overturned in 2018 after he\u2019d spent 23 years on death row. Jones was accused of raping and killing his girlfriend\u2019s 4-year-old daughter, Rachel, who died in 1994 following a rupture in her small intestine. The state claimed that Jones had assaulted her the day before her death, while she was in Jones\u2019 care. Had Jones\u2019s trial lawyers done basic investigative work, they would have learned that it was extremely unlikely Rachel\u2019s abdominal injury could have become fatal so quickly and that there was no solid evidence she was raped, as the Intercept has previously reported. But the jury heard none of this evidence and convicted Jones, who was then sentenced to death. Under Arizona law, individuals cannot raise ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal, the first review after a conviction. Instead, they have to wait until their state post-conviction review. Unlike during trial and direct appeal, there is no guaranteed right to a lawyer at this stage. Jones was appointed a lawyer who was not technically qualified to represent him in post-conviction proceedings, as the lawyer later admitted. When the lawyer moved to appoint an investigator, he did so under the wrong legal statute and the request was denied. The lawyer failed to argue that Jones received ineffective assistance of counsel at trial in Jones\u2019 petition for post-conviction relief, and the petition was denied. It wasn\u2019t until Jones reached the federal habeas stage of litigation that he received competent lawyers, who, with the benefit of the 2012 Martinez decision, were able to introduce new evidence and get Jones\u2019 conviction overturned. Ramirez grew up eating on the floor in a house littered with animal feces. His mother drank while she was pregnant with him and later beat him with electrical cords. He showed developmental delays, including delayed walking, potty training and speech, and had difficulty using utensils to eat. Ramirez was accused of fatally stabbing his girlfriend and her daughter in 1989. His trial counsel failed to present mitigating evidence of his abusive childhood or evidence that he had an intellectual disability, both of which could have resulted in a sentence less severe than death. (The Supreme Court later held in 2002 that the death penalty amounts to cruel and unusual punishment for people with intellectual disabilities.)As in Jones\u2019 case, Ramirez\u2019s state post-conviction lawyers failed to argue that he had received ineffective assistance at trial, and his post-conviction petition was denied. Like Jones, Ramirez finally received a capable lawyer at the federal habeas stage, and a federal appellate court directed the district court to allow evidentiary development of the issue. In a bid to keep Jones and Ramirez on death row, Arizona petitioned the Supreme Court to review their cases. The state argued that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), a bill passed by Congress in 1996 that curtailed federal habeas review, did not allow federal courts to consider the new evidence in the two cases. \u201cInnocence isn\u2019t enough,\u201d Arizona Attorney General Brunn Wall Roysden insisted during oral arguments last year. In other words, if an innocent person\u2019s lawyer fails to present evidence of their innocence at trial, and their state post-conviction lawyer fails to argue the trial lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness, the innocent person is out of luck.On Monday, the conservative justices on the Supreme Court agreed, claiming that under AEDPA, a federal habeas court cannot consider evidence beyond what is already in the state court record based on the ineffective assistance of state post-conviction counsel. The opinion was written by Justice Clarence Thomas, whose wife lobbied lawmakers to overturn the 2020 presidential election. In the opinion, Thomas includes no mention of the evidence of Jones\u2019 innocence or of Ramirez\u2019s intellectual disability. Instead, he wrote extensively about the \u201ccosts\u201d of federal habeas review and claimed that making habeas relief too widely available encourages prisoners to \u201csandba[g]\u201d state courts by presenting a few claims on state post-conviction review while saving others for federal habeas review if the first ones don\u2019t work out. \u201cThat claim is odd,\u201d Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. \u201cNo habeas petitioner or postconviction counsel could possibly perceive a strategic benefit from failing to raise a meritorious trial-ineffectiveness claim in an available forum.\u201d \u201cOn the other side of the ledger, the Court understates, or ignores altogether, the gravity of the state systems\u2019 failures in these two cases,\u201d Sotomayor continued. \u201cTo put it bluntly: Two men whose trial attorneys did not provide even the bare minimum level of representation required by the Constitution may be executed because forces outside of their control prevented them from vindicating their constitutional right to counsel.\u201dNeither AEDPA nor Supreme Court precedent required the court to rule in the direction it chose, Sotomayor wrote. The majority\u2019s opinion relies on \u201cits own mistaken understanding of AEDPA\u2019s policies,\u201d \u201crecycling claims\u201d the Supreme Court rejected in the 2012 Martinez case, Sotomayor continued. \u201cFor the subset of these petitioners who receive ineffective assistance both at trial and in state postconviction proceedings, the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee is now an empty one,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. \u201cMany, if not most, individuals in this position will have no recourse and no opportunity for relief.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A Florida law intended to punish social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter is an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment, a federal appeals court ruled Monday, dealing a major victory to companies who had been accused by GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis of discriminating against conservative thought.A three-judge panel of the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously concluded that it was overreach for DeSantis and the Republican-led Florida Legislature to tell the social media companies how to conduct their work under the Constitution\u2019s free speech guarantee.\u201cPut simply, with minor exceptions, the government can\u2019t tell a private person or entity what to say or how to say it,\u201d said Circuit Judge Kevin Newsom, an appointee of former President Donald Trump, in the opinion. \u201cWe hold that it is substantially likely that social media companies \u2014 even the biggest ones \u2014 are private actors whose rights the First Amendment protects.\u201dThe ruling upholds a similar decision by a Florida federal district judge on the law, which was signed by DeSantis in 2021. It was part of an overall conservative effort to portray social media companies as generally liberal in outlook and hostile to ideas outside of that viewpoint, especially from the political right.\u201cSome of these massive, massive companies in Silicon Valley are exerting a power over our population that really has no precedent in American history,\u201d DeSantis said during a May 2021 bill-signing ceremony. \u201cOne of their major missions seems to be suppressing ideas.\u201dHowever, the appeals panel ruled that the tech companies\u2019 actions were protected, with Judge Newsom writing that Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and others are \u201cengaged in constitutionally protected expressive activity when they moderate and curate the content that they disseminate on their platforms.\u201dThere was no immediate response to emails Monday afternoon from DeSantis\u2019 press secretary or communications director on the ruling. DeSantis is running for reelection this year and eyeing a potential run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. He was the first governor to sign a bill like this into law, although similar ones have been proposed in other states.One of those, in Texas, was allowed to go into effect by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and the tech companies involved there are asking for emergency U.S. Supreme Court review on whether to block it. No decision on that was immediately released.The Computer & Communications Industry Association, a nonprofit group representing tech and communications companies, said the ruling represents victory for Internet users and free speech in general \u2014 especially as it relates to potentially offensive content.\u201cWhen a digital service takes action against problematic content on its own site \u2014 whether extremism, Russian propaganda, or racism and abuse \u2014 it is exercising its own right to free expression,\u201d said CCIA President Matt Schruers in a statement.As enacted, the law would give Florida\u2019s attorney general authority to sue companies under the state\u2019s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. It would also allow individual Floridians to sue social media companies for up to $100,000 if they feel they\u2019ve been treated unfairly.The bill targeted social media platforms that have more than 100 million monthly users, which include online giants as Twitter and Facebook. But lawmakers carved out an exception for the Walt Disney Co. and their apps by including that theme park owners wouldn\u2019t be subject to the law.The law would require large social media companies to publish standards on how it decides to \u201ccensor, deplatform, and shadow ban.\u201dBut the appeals court rejected nearly all of the law\u2019s mandates, save for a few lesser provisions in the law.\u201cSocial media platforms exercise editorial judgment that is inherently expressive. When platforms choose to remove users or posts, deprioritize content in viewers\u2019 feeds or search results, or sanction breaches of their community standards, they engage in First-Amendment-protected activity,\u201d Newsom wrote for the court._____Associated Press writers Mark Sherman in Washington and Brendan Farrington in Tallahassee contributed to this story.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

In an apparent nod to the extreme right in America, he said the West is \u201ccommitting suicide\u201d through immigration.\"We can only demonstrate the madness of the progressive left if we have media to help us.\"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban addresses the American Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), which is being held in Budapest. pic.twitter.com/neuHRSSEV8Orb\u00e1n also called on conservatives in Europe and the U.S. to mobilize \u201ctroops\u201d to \u201creconquer\u201d institutions in Washington and Brussels from progressives ahead of elections in 2024, according to U.S. News & World Report.\u201cWe must coordinate the movement of our troops as we face a big test; 2024 will be a decisive year,\u201d he told the crowd.The Hungarian leader also blasted \u201cprogressive liberals, neo-Marxists dazed by the woke dream, people financed by George Soros and promoters of open societies.\u201dIt was the first time the CPAC event was held in Europe, in a country whose leader, Orb\u00e1n, is notorious for his Christian nationalism, anti-Semitism and homophobia. The event highlighted how an increasingly organized far right is eroding freedoms even while ironically touting them at the conference.Fox News host Tucker Carlson spoke via video at CPAC on Thursday, and the Trump administration\u2019s former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, was also scheduled to speak remotely.U.S. and most international journalists were barred from attending the conference, several publications and wire services reported.

Directed by Amanda Mitchell, \u201cHalftime\u201d chronicles Lopez during a critical moment in her career as she \u201creflects on her milestones and evolution as an artist, and navigates the second half of her career continuing to entertain, empower and inspire,\u201d according to the film\u2019s official description on Netflix. One milestone that has continued to elude her, however, is an Oscar trophy, as Lopez remarks about struggling \u201cto be heard, to be seen, to be taken seriously\u201d in an industry that has consistently disappointed her. Despite immense critical acclaim, she famously failed to score an Academy Award nomination for her performance in the Lorene Scafaria-directed crime drama.\u201cIt was hard. I just had very low self-esteem,\u201d an emotional Lopez says in a voiceover as the trailer shows her crying while looking at her phone in bed. \u201cI had to really figure out who I was and believe in that, and not believe in anything else.\u201dLater, in the trailer, she adds, \u201cI do this, not for an award. No, I do this to connect with people and make them feel things because I want to feel something.\u201dThe multi-hyphenate entertainer previously described the snub as a \u201clittle bit of a letdown,\u201d given the hype surrounding her performance, which still managed to garner nominations at the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards and Critics Choice Awards.\u201cYou realize you want people\u2019s validation. You want people to say you did a good job, and I realized, no, you don\u2019t need that,\u201d she said during a 2020 sitdown with Oprah Winfrey. \u201cYou do this because you love it. I don\u2019t need this award to tell me I\u2019m enough.\u201dElsewhere in the trailer, Ben Affleck, who is now engaged to Lopez 20 years after their romance first took the world by storm, makes an appearance to comment on how unfairly she\u2019s been picked apart in the press.\u201cI said to her once, \u2018Doesn\u2019t this bother you?\u2019\u201d Affleck recalls after a clip of Billy Bush asking about Lopez\u2019s famous posterior plays. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018I expected this.\u2019\u201d\u201cHalftime\u201d promises to give viewers an \u201cintimate peek behind the curtain revealing the grit and determination that makes Jennifer Lopez the icon she is, from her performances onscreen and on stages around the world, to her Super Bowl Halftime show, to the recent Presidential inauguration,\u201d according to the official logline. The film will make its world premiere as the opening night selection for the Tribeca Festival on June 8 before heading over to the streaming service, where it will debut globally on June 14.Watch the official trailer below.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostAmber Heard\u2019s younger sister, Whitney Henriquez, alleged in court Wednesday that she saw actor Johnny Depp exert increasing control over her sister, restricting who she socialized with, what she wore and which jobs she took during their tumultuous relationship.Heard\u2019s legal team called Henriquez, 34, to the stand on the 18th day of Depp\u2019s defamation trial against his ex-wife after multiple former friends of the couple said they witnessed abuse between them.Depp, 58 is seeking $50 million from Heard, 36, over a Washington Post editorial she wrote with the American Civil Liberties Union in 2018 that implied he was a violent partner.The \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d star has repeatedly denied that he was abusive, saying that Heard abused him.Attempting to control a significant other is among the most common hallmarks of an abusive relationship, according to advocates for domestic violence survivors. Abusive behavior can include violent actions like smashing personal belongings, but also emotional and economic abuse that creates an isolating situation in which one partner has outsized dominance.\u201cAt first, it would be, like, light jokes. You know, if she left the house wearing something, he\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to wear that?\u2019\u201d Henriquez told a panel of jurors in Virginia. She said \u201cit just intensified\u201d over time. \u201cSuddenly, they have the same stylist, and he had been essentially controlling what she wore to events and things like that. So she went from being able to wear whatever the hell she wanted, and then suddenly she\u2019s wearing anything that her stylist \u2015 his stylist \u2015 wanted her to wear. And her style over time just got more and more conservative,\u201d Henriquez said. Heard made similar accusations during her own testimony earlier this month, saying that Depp would tell her she looked like a \u201cwhore\u201d and did not like her baring skin.According to Henriquez, the actor also became increasingly \u201cprotective\u201d over the acting roles Heard took on until he had \u201ca problem with her taking any sort of job or any sort of audition.\u201d\u201cThen it became every time that she even thought about taking another movie, it was another fight,\u201d Henriquez testified. \u201cHe would often say things like, \u2018I don\u2019t even understand why she even needs to work. I\u2019ll take care of her. I\u2019ll take care of you, I\u2019ll take care of everyone, she doesn\u2019t even need to work at all.\u2019\u201d Depp was generous with properties he owned, inviting Heard\u2019s sister and several friends to stay in a collection of adjoining penthouses in downtown Los Angeles. But Henriquez said that he \u201ctook issue\u201d with various people over the years and allegedly prevented Heard from seeing them. \u201cOver time, she had such a small network of people that were there to support her, it was hard to watch,\u201d Henriquez said. Depp eventually had a problem with Henriquez, she added, prompting her to move out.Henriquez testified that, unlike others who knew the couple, she had witnessed physical violence, describing a fight in which Depp \u201cgrabbed Amber by the hair with one hand and was whacking her repeatedly in the face with the other.\u201d A friend who later fell out of Depp\u2019s good graces, iO Tillett Wright, said in a videotaped deposition played in court Tuesday that he never saw Depp strike Heard, but did see him throw glasses and bottles in her direction. Both actors were verbally abusive to one another, Wright testified. Another friend who lived in the penthouses while Depp and Heard were married, Joshua Drew, alleged in his taped deposition that he\u2019d seen the aftereffects of the couple\u2019s fights \u2015 smashed ceramics, spilled wine, trashed clothing racks. In one alleged incident, Depp directed his anger toward Drew.\u201cHe came in, caught eyes with me right away and beelined for me, screaming, cursing, spitting in my face,\u201d Drew said, adding that the actor\u2019s words were \u201cgibberish\u201d and that he appeared either drunk or high. Flanked by two bodyguards, Depp got within a foot of Drew\u2019s face, he said, calling it \u201cclose enough for it to be aggressive.\u201dHeard\u2019s team is expected to call Depp to the stand once more before closing arguments are made later this month.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostDoug Mastriano, the far-right state senator who attended the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and has been at the center of efforts to overturn the fair results of the 2020 presidential election, won the Republican primary for governor in Pennsylvania on Tuesday \u2014 raising the prospect of an insurrectionist being governor of a key battleground state for the 2024 presidential contest. Mastriano led the nine-person field with just over 40% of the vote on Tuesday when NBC News and The Associated Press called the race. He was beating his closest opponent, former U.S. Congressman Lou Barletta, by almost 20 points.He received a boost three days before the election from former President Donald Trump, who endorsed Mastriano and thanked him for his commitment to the lie that Trump didn\u2019t lose to President Joe Biden. \u201cThere is no one in Pennsylvania who has done more, or fought harder, for Election Integrity than State Senator Doug Mastriano,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cHe has revealed the Deceit, Corruption, and outright Theft of the 2020 Presidential Election, and will do something about it.\u201dAfter Biden\u2019s victory was certified in Pennsylvania in November 2020, Mastriano introduced a resolution that would have had the Republican-controlled state legislature overturn the results \u2014 Biden won there by 80,000 votes \u2014 and instead appoint electors who would declare Trump the winner. The resolution failed but further endeared Mastriano to the world of MAGA and to Trump himself, with whom Mastriano claims to be in regular contact. If Mastriano beats state Attorney General Josh Shapiro in the fall, he will wield enormous control over the key swing state\u2019s electoral process in 2024. The Pennsylvania governor appoints the secretary of state, who then runs statewide elections.Mastriano has said he has a candidate already selected and told Steve Bannon on a podcast recently that it\u2019s a \u201ca voting reform-minded individual who\u2019s been traveling the nation and knows voting reform extremely well.\u201d He has not named the potential nominee. Mastriano\u2019s commitment to the Big Lie led him to organize buses of supporters in Pennsylvania to travel to Washington, D.C., for the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally that exploded into the deadly storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Video footage later unearthed by online researchers showed him walking toward the Capitol shortly after protesters removed a police barricade blocking them. Mastriano claims to have never entered the Capitol itself and released a statement denouncing the day\u2019s violence. The House committee investigating the insurrection subpoenaed Mastriano in February, seeking documents related to his effort to appoint electors and to question him over his involvement in the events of Jan. 6. Mastriano is a key figure in Christian nationalism, the insurgent movement that holds the anti-democratic belief that America is a nation by and for Christians in need of saving from secular, satanic forces so that its laws can reflect a far-right interpretation of scripture. \u201cThe forces of darkness are hitting us really hard right now; we\u2019re going to bring the state back to righteousness; this is our day, our hour to take our state back and renew the blessings of America,\u201d Mastriano said at a rally last month. He has also spoken at an event whose organizers pledged to \u201creestablish the kingdom of God in PA.\u201d Republican Party leaders fear Mastriano is too extreme to beat Shapiro in November\u2019s general election. The Democrat is making that bet himself: Earlier this month, he released ads designed to help Mastriano in his primary, seeing him as a more beatable opponent than other Republicans.

Potential new Twitter owner Elon Musk has indicated he would let Trump back on the platform, but it\u2019s uncertain if Musk will finalize the purchase deal.Twitter has a policy prohibiting banned users from dodging restrictions by utilizing other profiles to post messages. But Trump routinely defies the policy by posting messages on the Twitter account of his paid aide Liz Harrington.

Several responses to the profile, however, indicate it\u2019s brand new. HuffPost first spotted it Sunday.There were close to 2,200 followers Monday evening. Several critics called for the new account to be reported as violating the platform\u2019s policy prohibiting banned users from evading restrictions.

The business, the stakes, everything that\u2019s been infused in the last 10 years or so. There\u2019s a kind of spontaneity and good time that we have to be careful to preserve,\u201d Kennedy added.So what\u2019s up next? On the film front, a new \u201cStar Wars\u201d project from \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d director Taika Waititi will arrive on the big screen before Patty Jenkins\u2019 much delayed \u201cRogue Squadron\u201d hits theaters.As for \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d director Rian Johnson\u2019s previously announced trilogy of films, Kennedy confirmed that the project is on the back burner due to the \u201cunbelievably busy\u201d filmmaker\u2019s forthcoming \u201cKnives Out\u201d sequels as part of his deal with Netflix.\u201cI hesitate to use the word trilogies anymore because Star Wars is much more about persistent storytelling,\u201d she told the outlet.Expect to see more \u201cStar Wars\u201d stories on Disney+ in the near future with the highly anticipated premiere of \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi\u201d later this month. \u201cAndor,\u201d which picks up with Diego Luna\u2019s \u201cRogue One\u201d character, will arrive later this summer, before a third season of \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d premieres in either late 2022 or early 2023. Rosario Dawson will then front \u201cAhsoka,\u201d the first female-led Jedi live-action \u201cStar Wars\u201d story, which is on track for a 2023 release.The Vanity Fair deep dive also revealed new details about \u201cThe Acolyte,\u201d an upcoming series from \u201cRussian Doll\u201d showrunner Leslye Headland set in the High Republic era that will reportedly star Amandla Stenberg. The mystery thriller takes place 100 years before \u201cThe Phantom Menace\u201d and will explore the \u201cpolitical and personal and spiritual things that came up in a time period that we don\u2019t know much about.\u201dLastly, \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d director Jon Watts will also create a new series under the code name \u201cGrammar Rodeo\u201d set after \u201cReturn of the Jedi.\u201d The Disney+ project will reportedly star a group of teen actors and is described as a \u201cgalactic version of classic Amblin coming-of-age adventure films of the \u201980s.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior National Correspondent, HuffPostHealth insurance premiums for millions of Americans will spike if Congress doesn\u2019t act in the next few months, with particularly big increases in politically contested states, according to a report that the liberal advocacy group Families USA released on Monday morning. The subject of the report is the fate of some extra, but temporary, financial assistance available to people who buy insurance on their own through HealthCare.gov or state-run online marketplaces like the Maryland Health Connection, Minnesota\u2019s MNSure and Your Health Idaho. The assistance, which President Joe Biden and the Democrats enacted as part of last year\u2019s COVID-19 relief program, has reduced premiums by hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars a year. But the assistance is set to end in December. If that happens, prices will go back up and consumers will start to learn about the increases in the fall. Monday\u2019s Families USA report breaks down what that would mean in the 33 states using HealthCare.gov, based on a straightforward calculation using data that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services published earlier this year.On average, the Families USA report says, premiums for people buying individual coverage would increase by 53%, with the lowest average increases in New Hampshire (28%) and the highest in Wyoming (132%).\u201cThese premium increases are a very big deal,\u201d Frederick Isasi, Families USA executive director, told HuffPost via email. \u201cPeople are going to see their premiums go up by more than half \u2015 at a time where inflation is way up and families are struggling to pay all their bills.\u201dNone of this should seem surprising. In September, researchers at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation issued a separate report predicting substantially higher premiums if the extra assistance lapses. The impact would be particularly tough on lower-income people buying marketplace coverage, the Kaiser report noted, because many would react by opting for cheaper, less generous plans that leave people with higher out-of-pocket costs.\u201cIf the [extra] subsidies expire, nearly all of the 13 million people getting subsidized coverage on the marketplaces will see an increase in their out-of-pocket premium payments, and for many it will be the steepest increase they have seen since the markets first opened,\u201d Cynthia Cox, a Kaiser vice president and director of its Affordable Care Act program, told HuffPost.The question all along has been whether lawmakers would act to avert this situation. So far they haven\u2019t, although Biden and Democratic leaders have been trying. A key provision of the \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d legislation they put together last year would have extended the assistance for several years. Their effort fell apart in December, following a series of objections from Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), whose vote Democrats would need in the evenly divided Senate because no Republicans support the legislation. Biden, Democratic leaders and Manchin have all said they would still like to enact some of Build Back Better\u2019s provisions, as part of a much smaller bill. But there\u2019s been no visible progress toward a compromise. And it\u2019s not clear how many Democrats recognize what the higher premiums would mean for their constituents \u2015 or how the price increases would play out politically, especially at a time when polls show the rising cost of goods and services is voters\u2019 top concern. \u201cFamilies will start to receive notices about skyrocketing premiums just weeks before the midterm elections,\u201d Isasi said. \u201cSome of the most closely watched states \u2015 for example in Florida, North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona \u2015 will experience some of the largest increases.\u201d The cost of insurance at HealthCare.gov and the state-run marketplaces has been a frequent source of public frustration and political turmoil since the Affordable Care Act took full effect in 2014. Although millions saw savings or got coverage for the first time, millions of others remained uninsured or struggled with premiums and out-of-pocket costs. A big reason for that was that former President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) had to downsize the program, cutting back on its financial assistance, in order to accommodate more conservative Democrats whose votes they needed.Obama, Pelosi and their allies always said they hoped to circle back and put more money into the law known as Obamacare, which is precisely what Biden, Pelosi and the rest of today\u2019s Democratic leaders did with the COVID-19 bill \u2015 and what they hope to keep doing, if they can find a way to pass legislation extending the assistance beyond 2022.Republicans have shown no interest in an extension of the assistance, or any larger legislation that might include it, in part because the money to pay for the extension would come sources Republicans traditionally oppose, like higher taxes on the wealthy. That has left Biden and his allies completely dependent on Democratic votes in the Senate, where support from Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona has proved particularly difficult to secure.Both have constituents who would face premium spikes because they get insurance through HealthCare.gov. And in nominal terms \u2015 that is, dollars rather than percentages \u2015 West Virginia would actually be the HealthCare.gov state where people face the highest average premium increases, of $1,536 per year.Monday\u2019s report could make sure those two lawmakers, along with the rest of their colleagues, understand that \u2014 if they are paying attention.Senior National Correspondent, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

It was their decision,\u201d Trump said.She was responding to Hegseth\u2019s observation that Jill Biden, Michelle Obama, and Hillary Clinton all appeared on the cover of Vogue when their husbands were in the White House.Kamala Harris was on the cover before she became vice president.Trump insisted she had \u201cmuch more important things to do \u2014 and I did in the White House \u2014 than being on the cover of Vogue.\u201dIn first interview since leaving the WH, Melania is asked, \u201cWith your business background, and your fashion background, and your beauty, never on the cover of Vogue?\u201d A - \u201cThey\u2019re biased ..

Those of us that work at [Vogue publisher] Conde Nast believe that you have to stand up for what you believe in, and you have to take a point of view,\u201d Wintour added.Melania Trump also took the opportunity in her Fox News interview to bash \u201cleadership\u201d for America\u2019s shortage of infant formula.The Biden administration does not manufacture formula; it\u2019s made and sold by three major companies, which have little competition and a powerful control of the market.The shortage was triggered in part by pandemic-related supply chain issues combined with a massive safety recall by the largest formula producer, Abbott Nutrition, which was forced to close its Michigan plant earlier this year due to contamination concerns.Melania Trump gives first interview since leaving the White House\u2026and it\u2019s on Fox News, of course. pic.twitter.com/2SW1KftjsiTrends Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

When Olsen\u2019s questioner asks her if she thinks the man in the photo is indeed \u201cthe smartest man alive,\u201d Olsen gives a bonkers response:\u201cNo,\u201d Olsen said with a laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t know him, though, but I would never assume that an actor would be the smartest man alive.\u201d Vanity Fair\u2019s skeptical interviewer then asks, \u201cYou don\u2019t know him at all?\u201dOlsen furrows her brow and contemplates.\u201cI don\u2019t think so.

Stefanik is one of several so-called \u201cpro-life\u201d Republican lawmakers who want abortion banned yet see no contradiction in denying infant formula to babies at federal detention facilities.Critics on Twitter piled on Stefanik.One thing we are not going to do is follow House Republican leadership's suggestion that we let babies starve.

Herbster is a longtime donor and ally of the former president, and he received a boost when the Trump endorsed him late last year. Trump went to the state to campaign for him as recently as May 1 and held a tele-rally less than a week before the election.Trump \u2015 who himself faces accusations of rape, assault and harassment from even more women \u2015 called Herbster a \u201cfine man\u201d and said \u201che is innocent of these despicable charges.\u201d\u201cI have to defend my friends, I have to defend people that are good,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cThese are malicious charges to derail him long enough that the election can go by before the proper defense can be put forward.\u201dTrump\u2019s endorsement of Herbster did not please many Republicans in the state. Last year, outgoing Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) asked the former president to remain neutral. Ricketts later endorsed Pillen, saying Herbster would be a \u201cterrible governor.\u201d Eight women accused Herbster of groping them, including a state senator in his own party. State Sen. Julie Slama told the Nebraska Examiner that in 2019, she was at a GOP fundraising dinner when she walked by Herbster. According to the Examiner, \u201che reached up her skirt, without her consent, and touched her inappropriately.\u201dAnother woman who attended the same dinner and has worked as a legislative aide in Nebraska, said Herbster also assaulted her at the same dinner.\u201cFor years I have struggled with an experience I had with Charles W. Herbster,\u201d Elizabeth Todsen said. \u201cAt a political event in 2019, Herbster sexually groped me while greeting my table.\u201dHerbster took a page out of Trump\u2019s playbook, denying the allegations and attacking the women who made the accusations. He even sued Slama for defamation, calling her claims \u201cpart of a greater scheme calculated to try and defeat my candidacy.\u201d But the accusations took their toll, and Herbster lost his momentum. All 13 women in the Nebraska state Senate \u2015 which includes both Democrats and Republicans \u2015 signed a letter saying that Herbster\u2019s alleged behavior was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and that he was \u201cunfit to serve.\u201dTrump won Nebraska by 19 percentage points in the 2020 election, and there hasn\u2019t been a Democratic governor there in decades. Pillen will face Democratic state Sen. Carol Blood in November.

Phil Murphy (D) on Wednesday announced legislation to expand reproductive health care coverage in the state, with a particular eye on abortion access \u2015 and other states\u2019 efforts to curtail it.Speaking from behind a pink placard reading \u201cEnsuring Reproductive Freedom,\u201d Murphy rolled out a handful of proposals that build on the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act, which codified the right to an abortion into state law earlier this year.\u201cIn the coming weeks, a right-wing majority on the U.S. Supreme Court likely will take a wrecking ball to 50 years of its own precedent, and for the very first time in American history overturn a decision in order to diminish our rights,\u201d the governor said, explaining the impetus for his proposals.\u201cWithout access, rights mean nothing,\u201d he added.Murphy then urged the state Assembly to pass legislation expanding the Freedom of Reproductive Choice Act, in particular seeking to:That last point is a particularly interesting development. While Republican-led states across the country have enacted abortion bans aimed at challenging Roe v.

That can even include driving the woman to the airport to receive health care in another state.Murphy didn\u2019t describe in detail how he intends to shield New Jersey\u2019s medical providers from complying with legal action that originates in another state, but he was adamant about the commitment.\u201cLet me be clear,\u201d he said in a statement after the speech. \u201cNew Jersey will not cooperate with any out of state investigation into our health care providers that seeks to punish anyone \u2015 patient, provider, counselor, friend, or Uber driver \u2015 for providing abortion care.\u201d\u201cAbortion is health care and health care decisions should be left up to the individual,\u201d he added. \u201cWith the legislation we\u2019ve announced today, New Jersey will continue to lead the way forward on reproductive freedom.\u201dNational Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2015 As the Senate voted on safeguarding abortion rights Wednesday, a group of House Democrats were there urging their colleagues to vote yes.The Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, which would have created federal protections for providing and accessing abortion services, failed along party lines \u2015 with the exception of West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin, the only Democrat who voted against it. The legislation, which has already passed the House, was widely expected to fail in the Senate. Democrats had tried to advance it in February and also hit a GOP roadblock then. But a number of House Democrats still wanted to be there, marching from their side of the Hill over to the Senate. Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) was be one of those members. For Bush, this fight is personal.\u201cI am furious,\u201d she told a small group of reporters in her office Wednesday morning.In 1994, Bush was raped on a church trip at the age of 17. She then became pregnant and sought out a clinic for options on what to do. Bush first publicly told this story \u2015 about the pressure she felt, the options she had and the effect of anti-abortion protesters \u2015 last year at a congressional hearing on reproductive rights. She spoke about it again Tuesday, calling on the Senate to take action. Bush acknowledged the reality that the WHPA isn\u2019t going to become law just yet. But she said it\u2019s still important for the Senate to hold the vote in light of all that\u2019s changed.What\u2019s changed since February is that last week, Politico published a leaked draft of an opinion written by Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito showing that a majority of the court is ready to strike down Roe v. Wade. \u201cJust because you serve in Congress does not mean that you are up and full of information on every subject,\u201d Bush said. \u201cAnd so now that people have more information [about what the court will do], put them back on record.\u201dBush said she\u2019d like to see President Joe Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) pushing harder to change the filibuster for abortion-related legislation. That would allow the Senate to pass legislation with just a majority, rather than 60 votes. The issue, however, is that Democrats don\u2019t have their entire caucus on board to change those rules. But she\u2019d also like to hear Biden use the word \u201cabortion\u201d more. Last week was the first time in his presidency that Biden publicly said the word \u201cabortion.\u201d Up until then, he had used it only three times \u2015 but all in written remarks. \u201cI do think that he should say it more,\u201d Bush said. \u201cPeople are looking to what the president does. A lot of times that holds more weight than what people are hearing come out of Congress. Because folks may not always know their Congress member\u2019s name. ... But everybody knows who their president is,\u201d she added, recounting her recent visit with a group of preschool kids who all could identify Biden as the president.House Democratic leaders have also been taking heat from some in the party for backing the reelection of Henry Cuellar in Texas, the only Democrat in the House who opposes abortion rights. He\u2019s running against progressive Jessica Cisneros in the May 24 runoff. Bush declined to condemn either the leadership or Cuellar himself, but she said she would prefer for the caucus to stay neutral in a situation like that rather than to actively back an anti-abortion member. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to have a big tent where you have everybody doing their thing, but then it\u2019s another thing in how we show up and support. ... I\u2019m thinking about my district, thinking about the people who are going to be most affected by overturning Roe. ... That\u2019s just something I would not push,\u201d Bush said. \u201cBecause for me, still, at the end of the day, if you don\u2019t like abortion, then just don\u2019t get one and don\u2019t promote it. You don\u2019t like Burger King, don\u2019t go to Burger King.\u201dWashington Bureau Chief, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Labor Reporter, HuffPostSenior Reporter, HuffPostStaffers in the U.S. House of Representatives are a step closer to unionizing following a vote by their bosses on Tuesday night.House lawmakers approved a resolution that grants legal protections to staffers who are trying to organize their offices on Capitol Hill. Workers involved in the union effort say it constitutes a crucial change to a congressional workplace law that would allow them to form unions without fear of retaliation.The House approved the resolution on a party-line vote. But instead of holding a vote on the resolution itself, Democrats embedded it into a procedural measure setting up votes on several other pieces of legislation, including aid for Ukraine. The staff union measure can be implemented in the House without a companion resolution being passed in the Senate. The measure only benefits employees in House offices. House staffers on the Democratic side have spent more than a year building a union campaign they hope will improve working conditions inside Capitol offices. The newly created Congressional Workers Union has been sharing stories of employees who work ridiculous hours, contend with abusive bosses and discrimination and can\u2019t afford to live in Washington on low salaries.Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who supported the measure, said having unionized House staffers could ultimately result in Congress passing better legislation down the line. \u201cThe staff people that I\u2019ve talked to, in and out of my office, that are interested in the union are probably the most committed to public policy,\u201d Grijalva told HuffPost. Separately this month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced a minimum salary for House staffers, setting the floor at $45,000. Workers on the Hill haven\u2019t enjoyed the same rights to band together and bargain collectively as most other U.S. workers. Congress ostensibly granted Hill staffers the ability to unionize in 1995 through the Congressional Accountability Act, but lawmakers never took the crucial step of formally approving the regulations put together by Congress\u2019 internal workplace agency to make it happen.The measure the House passed Tuesday would protect workers who are organizing and set up a process for bargaining through the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights. Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.), a former union organizer and strong ally of organized labor, sponsored the House resolution and rounded up support among fellow Democrats.Two members of the Congressional Workers Union organizing committee told HuffPost ahead of the vote that lawmakers had essentially exempted themselves from collective bargaining for years and that the House was now rectifying a double standard. The two committee members spoke on condition of anonymity because they still felt unprotected from retaliation. \u201cThere\u2019s a culture of secrecy, and you have to pay your dues to make your way up the ladder. That\u2019s really what allows these workplace abuses to fester,\u201d one said. \u201cWithout giving staffers the legal protections that other workers across the U.S. have, we\u2019re in a place where we can\u2019t fully address these concerns.\u201dIf House members blocked collective bargaining in their own workplaces, that would suggest they feel that \u201cthey\u2019re above the laws that they create,\u201d the staffer added.Unions have made some major breakthroughs recently. The union Workers United has won more than 60 elections at Starbucks stores around the country in a matter of months after Starbucks was union-free in the U.S. for decades. The recently formed Amazon Labor Union stunned the labor movement when it won a historic election at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse in early April. Progressive Democrats have cheered on those developments and lambasted companies like Starbucks and Amazon for their anti-union campaigns. With the Democratic Party shifting in a more pro-labor direction in recent years, it would be hard for Democratic lawmakers to oppose their own staffers\u2019 union effort without looking like total hypocrites.One of the staffers said even some progressives won\u2019t like the idea of bargaining with a union, but they\u2019ll have to if they want to abide by their own principles.\u201cIf you look at who signed on to the resolution, there were many, many progressive leaders who were not the first to sign on,\u201d the staffer said. \u201cI do think there\u2019s public pressure that exists for those progressives.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a culture of secrecy, and you have to pay your dues to make your way up the ladder. That\u2019s really what allows these workplace abuses to fester.\u201dIt remains to be seen what, exactly, collective bargaining will look like in Congress. John Uelmen, the general counsel for the Office of Congressional Workplace Rights, testified in a House hearing in March that workers could unionize on an office-by-office basis, rather than being lumped together in one bargaining unit, according to Roll Call. Within committees, each party would have its own staff bargaining unit, since the unit members would answer to different leaders.In all likelihood, the organizing would happen primarily \u2014 and perhaps exclusively \u2014 on the Democratic side of the aisle. Republican lawmakers have opposed paving the way for their own offices to unionize, and many of their own conservative staffers may not be interested in bargaining a union contract. It\u2019s also unclear what, exactly, staffers would be able to bargain over. The union committee members told HuffPost they want to have a say on everything unions typically do: salaries, the promotion process, discipline and grievances, severance, health and safety issues, and more. (Federal workers outside the legislative branch have collective bargaining rights, but under the law, they can\u2019t negotiate over pay.) The congressional staffers said they would consider any efforts to restrict their bargaining abilities as a form of union-busting.\u201cAt a time when workers across the country are standing up and fighting for their own rights, we are looking to members of Congress, especially Democratic leadership, to stand up for them,\u201d one staffer said. \u201cFor any of that union-busting to happen would be a sad, sad thing for our party.\u201dLabor Reporter, HuffPostSenior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection has interviewed nearly 1,000 people. But the nine-member panel has yet to talk to the two most prominent players in that day\u2019s events \u2014 former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence.As the investigation winds down and the panel plans a series of hearings in June, members of the committee are debating whether to call the two men, whose conflict over whether to certify Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 presidential election win was at the center of the attack. Trump pressured Pence for days, if not weeks, to use his ceremonial role presiding over the Jan. 6 count to try to block or delay Biden\u2019s certification. Pence refused to do so, and rioters who broke into the building that day called for his hanging.There are reasons to call either or both of them. The committee wants to be as thorough as possible, and critics are sure to pounce if they don\u2019t even try. But some lawmakers on the panel have argued that they\u2019ve obtained all the information they need without Trump and Pence.Nearly a year into their wide-ranging investigation into the worst attack on the Capitol in more than two centuries, the House committee has interviewed hundreds of witnesses and received more than 100,000 pages of documents. Interviews have been conducted out of the public eye in obscure federal office buildings and private Zoom sessions.The Democratic chairman, Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, said in early April that the committee has been able to validate a lot of the statements attributed to Trump and Pence without their testimony. He said at that time there was \u201cno effort on the part of the committee\u201d to call Pence, though there have been discussions since then about potentially doing so.Speaking about Pence, Thompson said the panel had \u201cinitially thought it would be important\u201d to call him, but \u201cthere are a lot of things on that day we know \u2014 we know the people who tried to get him to change his mind about the count and all of that, so what is it we need?\u201dA lot of the people they are interviewing, Thompson added, \u201care people we didn\u2019t have on the original list.\u201dThe panel, comprised of seven Democrats and two Republicans, has said that the evidence it has compiled is enough to link Trump to a federal crime.Much of the evidence the committee has released so far has come from White House aides and staff \u2014 including little-known witnesses like Cassidy Hutchinson, a former special assistant in the Trump White House, and Greg Jacob, who served as Pence\u2019s chief counsel in the vice president\u2019s office. The panel also has thousands of texts from Trump\u2019s final chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and has talked to two of the former president\u2019s children, Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., who were with their father the day of the attack.Among hundreds of others, the committee has also interviewed former White House aide Jared Kushner, Ivanka\u2019s husband, former communications director Alyssa Farah and multiple Pence aides, including his chief of staff, Marc Short, and his national security adviser, Keith Kellogg. Former White House press secretaries Kayleigh McEnany and Stephanie Grisham have also appeared, as has former senior policy adviser Stephen Miller.There are still questions that Trump and Pence could answer, including what they talked about the morning of Jan. 6, when Trump made his final plea for Pence to overturn the election when he presided over the Electoral College count in Congress. Lawmakers have been able to document most of Trump\u2019s end of the call but not what Pence said in response.In the hours after Trump and Pence spoke, the vice president issued a statement saying he did not have the power to object to the counting of electoral votes. But the president did not relent, and went on to publicly pressure Pence at his massive rally in front of the White House and then on Twitter even after his supporters had broken into the Capitol.Still, it is unlikely that the two former leaders would speak about the conversation to the committee \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear if they would cooperate at all.While Pence has yet to comment on the committee\u2019s work, Trump would certainly be a hostile witness. He has fought the investigation in court, demonized the committee on TV and tried to assert executive privilege over White House papers and any conversations he had with his aides \u2014 demands that would certainly apply to his morning call with Pence.In addition, calling a former president or vice president to testify in a congressional investigation is a rare, if not unprecedented, move that could face major legal hurdles and backfire politically.The Jan. 6 committee has given only a glimpse of what it has found, mostly in court filings where excerpts of transcripts have been used.A recent filing from the committee revealed portions of interviews with Hutchinson that took place in February and March of this year. That testimony provided new evidence about the involvement of GOP lawmakers in Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the 2020 election, including a meeting at the White House in which attorneys for the president advised that putting up an alternate slate of electors declaring Trump the winner was not \u201clegally sound.\u201dAnother court document revealed testimony from Jacob, who served as Pence\u2019s chief counsel. In a series of emails, Jacob repeatedly told lawyer John Eastman, who was working with Trump, that Pence could not intervene in his ceremonial role and halt the certification of the electoral votes. Jacob told Eastman the legal framework he was putting forward to do just that was \u201cessentially entirely made up.\u201dMeadows\u2019 texts have also been revelatory, detailing how people inside Trump\u2019s orbit pleaded for him to forcefully condemn the attack on the Capitol as it unfolded. The pleas came from Trump\u2019s children, members of Congress and even Fox News hosts.\u201cHe has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. texted Meadows as protesters breached the security perimeter at the Capitol.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

(AP) \u2014 More than 40 years after blazing a trail for female video game characters, Ms. Pac-Man was inducted Thursday into the World Video Game Hall of Fame, along with Dance Dance Revolution, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization.The Hall of Fame considers electronic games of all types each year \u2014 arcade, console, computer, handheld and mobile. Inductees are recognized for their popularity and influence on the video game industry or pop culture over time.The Ms. Pac-Man arcade game was released in 1981 as Midway\u2019s follow-up to Pac-Man, which entered the hall as part of the inaugural class in 2015. The Pac-Man sequel reimagined the main character to acknowledge the original game\u2019s female fans, according to the hall. After selling 125,000 cabinets within the first five years, it became one of the best-selling arcade games of all time.There was nothing inherently gendered about early video games, said Julia Novakovic, senior archivist at the hall. But \u201cby offering the first widely recognized female video game character,\u201d she said, \u201cMs. Pac-Man represented a turn in the cultural conversation about women\u2019s place in the arcade, as well as in society at large.\u201dThe Class of 2022 was chosen from a field of finalists that also included Assassin\u2019s Creed, Candy Crush Saga, Minesweeper, NBA Jam, PaRappa the Rapper, Resident Evil, Rogue, and Words with Friends. It is the eighth class to be inducted since the World Video Game Hall of Fame was established at The Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, New York.Konami\u2019s Dance Dance Revolution, first seen in arcades in Japan in 1998, was recognized for helping to pave the way for other music-centered games like Guitar Hero and Rock Band. The fast-paced game put players on a dance floor with a screen in front to direct their moves.\u201cMusic has been an integral part of human life since prehistoric times, so it comes as no surprise that DDR enjoyed a unique popularity that spanned ages, genders, and regions,\u201d said video game curator Lindsey Kurano.A home version of the game followed on the Sony PlayStation in 1999.The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, also first released in 1998, came out for the Nintendo 64 gaming console and defined what a 3D action video game could be, Hall of Fame officials said. The award-winning game sold more than 7.6 million copies worldwide and continues to be recognized by some players and critics as one of the best video games ever made.\u201cEven today, developers throughout the world credit The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time as influencing the way they create games,\u201d digital games curator Andrew Borman said. \u201cThe game\u2019s sprawling 3D world, fluid combat, complex puzzles and time-shifting story combined to inspire a wonder in players that they have never forgotten.\u201dSid Meier\u2019s Civilization, released in 1991, was recognized as an influential simulation and strategy game. The game, which invited players to develop their own empires, launched a series of successor games, including the most recent Civilization: Beyond Earth and Civilization VI.\u201cThe addictive nature of the game, which creator Sid Meier himself called the \u2018one more turn\u2019 quality, and its nearly unlimited choices that prevented repetitive gameplay, earned Civilization recognition from Computer Gaming World as the best video game of all time in 1996,\u201d said Jon-Paul Dyson, director of The Strong\u2019s International Center for the History of Electronic games. \u201cAltogether \u2014 and given the extraordinarily long periods of play the game afforded \u2014 players have engaged with the Civilization series for more than a billion hours.\u201dAnyone can nominate a game for the World Video Game Hall of Fame.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostWith a fraction of the fanfare that accompanied her first dramatic win, Rep. Shontel Brown, a Cleveland-area Democrat, won her primary election on Tuesday, virtually assuring her a full term in Congress representing northeast Ohio\u2019s predominantly Democratic 11th Congressional District.Brown has now defeated former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, a progressive star, for the second time. Brown previously dispatched with Turner during an August special election. The two candidates were vying to fill a seat vacated by former Rep. Marcia Fudge, whom President Joe Biden appointed to serve as secretary of housing and urban development.\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is surprised,\u201d said David Cohen, a political science professor at the University of Akron. \u201cIf a progressive candidate couldn\u2019t win during a special election in an open seat, there was no way they were going to pull it out with an incumbent member of Congress.\u201dThere were reasons for Turner to hold out some degree of hope during a second run. The district\u2019s new boundaries include the progressive Cleveland suburb of Lakewood. And low turnout might have given additional weight to Turner\u2019s base of highly motivated, left-leaning voters.But the bar is always higher for a candidate asking voters to expel an incumbent, and Brown simply didn\u2019t do enough to disappoint voters during her first five months in office.\u201cShe\u2019s done what she was expected to do,\u201d Cohen said.As promised, Brown became a reliable vote for Biden, who returned the favor by making Brown his second endorsement of the midterm election cycle. Brown even ingratiated herself with the party\u2019s progressive wing, successfully seeking admission to the Congressional Progressive Caucus and receiving an endorsement from the bloc\u2019s political action committee.In addition, Brown continued to enjoy the support of deep-pocketed pro-Israel groups like the Democratic Majority for Israel. She also picked up the big-money backing of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and Protect Our Future, a super PAC funded by a cryptocurrency billionaire.Turner, by contrast, came to the table with fewer political assets than in her first run, when a veritable army of national progressives contributed to her campaign financially or in person. She raised a fraction of the money that she had during the special election. And despite the endorsement of her loyal ally, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), as well as a last-minute blessing from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and a six-figure infusion from the left-leaning Rebellion PAC, it wasn\u2019t enough to make the difference.The one area where Brown broke with Biden, to say nothing of many CPC members, is on U.S.-Israel policy. She joined a small group of moderate, pro-Israel Democrats who have expressed reservations about the terms of a revived Iran nuclear deal and its implications for Israel\u2019s security. There are a limited number of Democratic voters, however, for whom right-leaning views on Israel are disqualifying. And in Ohio\u2019s 11th, home to Ohio\u2019s largest Jewish community, Brown\u2019s stance was likely beneficial.\u201cIt\u2019s where most elected members of the Democratic Party are at this point,\u201d Cohen said.Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Politics Reporter, HuffPostTOLEDO, Ohio \u2014 J.D. Vance, the author and first-time candidate who nabbed former President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement, won Ohio\u2019s GOP Senate primary on Tuesday, settling a tumultuous race for the Republican nomination.Vance\u2019s campaign had stagnated until last month, when Trump made his pick in Ohio\u2019s crowded contest. The move bumped the \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author out ahead of his opponents, including Josh Mandel, a former state treasurer and the far-right evangelical candidate, and state Sen. Matt Dolan, a moderate who refused to kiss Trump\u2019s ring.Ohio\u2019s GOP Senate primary was the first major test of Trump\u2019s endorsement mettle \u2014 and the outcome seems to bode well for him in upcoming races. Trump is backing Republican primary candidates in more than two dozen states, but not every one is as well positioned as Vance. Trump\u2019s other picks aren\u2019t surging with his support, or they carry baggage that could hurt them in a general election.\u201cI absolutely have to thank the 45th president of the United States, Donald Trump,\u201d Vance said at his victory bash in Cincinnati.Besides Dolan and Mandel, Vance beat financier Mike Gibbons and former Ohio GOP chair Jane Timken. He will likely face Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan in November, in a state Trump won twice.Vance wasn\u2019t a tailor-made Trump man. The 37-year-old venture capitalist was an early Trump critic before coming around to the former president when he decided to run for U.S. Senate. Trump\u2019s own embrace of Vance has been tepid. At a rally last month, Trump acknowledged that Vance had said \u201csome bad shit\u201d about him previously, but so have many Republicans, he said. \u201cI have to do what I have to do,\u201d Trump said, regarding endorsing Vance so he beats the Democrat in November.At a rally in Nebraska over the weekend for gubernatorial candidate Charles Herbster, Trump seemed to forget whom he endorsed, touting a nonexistent candidate named \u201cJ.D. Mandel\u201d in Ohio. \u201cAnd he\u2019s doing great,\u201d Trump added.This is the first time Vance has run for public office. The GOP nominee is known for his best-selling memoir about growing up around poverty and addiction in a former steel-manufacturing town. He writes about escaping his upbringing through enlisting in the Marine Corps. Vance graduated from Yale Law School and worked for PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who contributed $13.5 million to a Vance-aligned super PAC. Thiel is also backing Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters.After returning to the area where he grew up, Vance started a nonprofit aimed at helping Ohioans struggling with drug addiction and other problems, although an investigation of its tax records revealed it mostly existed to pay consultants.In his pitch to voters, Vance has railed against China, the illegal drug trade, teaching students about racism in schools, and Big Tech. In a bizarre ad released last month, Vance asked voters, \u201cAre you a racist? Do you hate Mexicans?\u201d The commercial seemed to be making a point about the names Republicans get called for wanting to see Trump\u2019s border wall completed, but it never quite lands.For much of the race, Mandel and Vance were each other\u2019s main opponents. But Mandel\u2019s support seemed to cool after he and Gibbons almost came to blows during a debate. In a campaign stop for Vance, Donald Trump Jr. signaled that Mandel\u2019s performance may have cost him the endorsement, but others speculate it was more a product of Thiel\u2019s lobbying and vast resources.\u201cRejection sucks, right? I mean to prostrate himself as ridiculously as he did to get rejected, that has to be rough,\u201d a Republican consultant in Ohio told HuffPost.Vance campaigned with Reps. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and Marjorie Taylor-Greene (R-Ga.), and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) leading up to Election Day, while Mandel enlisted former Trump national security advisor Michael Flynn and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). Timken appeared with Sen. Rob Portman, whose retirement sparked this contest.The race was a nail-biter until the very end.\u201cOh god,\u201d said Josh Culling, an Ohio-based political consultant, a few days before the primary, when asked to predict who might win. \u201cWho the hell knows?\u201dPolitics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostTwo years ago, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) signed a series of bills to expand abortion access and eliminate decades-old restrictions on the practice that had made the commonwealth a difficult place to obtain such a procedure.The new laws were possible because Democrats had successfully flipped both chambers of the Virginia state legislature in 2019 and regained majority control of the bodies for the first time in more than two decades.Two years later, Virginia may be on the brink of a dramatic reversal. Last fall, Republicans won back the governor\u2019s mansion, retook control of the state House of Delegates, and trimmed Democrats\u2019 majority in the state Senate to a single seat. Now, with the Supreme Court apparently on the brink of a decision that would fully overturn Roe v. Wade, according to a leaked draft obtained by Politico on Monday night, the newly empowered Virginia GOP may be ready to join the bevy of states ready to severely limit or perhaps totally ban the practice. While midterm elections usually turn on who controls Congress, the looming Supreme Court decision might mean that the most meaningful races will be often-overlooked campaigns for state legislative districts. For all the attention on Washington, it is unlikely that Senate Democrats will manage to pass the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, a bill that would codify Roe and legal abortion into federal law, any time soon. It will be in state capitals like Richmond, Lansing and Phoenix that the future of abortion rights in America is most immediately and directly decided. Already, California is moving to codify abortion rights, as New Jersey did earlier this year. Republican-controlled legislatures, meanwhile, are racing in the opposite direction.\u201cWith the Supreme Court on the precipice of overturning Roe v. Wade, state legislatures will become the main battleground for protecting abortion rights in America,\u201d Vicky Hausman, the co-founder of Forward Majority, which has sought to flip GOP-controlled legislatures in recent cycles, said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cWe can no longer count on the federal government or the courts. If you care about reproductive rights, you need to care about state legislative power.\u201dOutside the courts, state legislatures have served as the focal point of the anti-abortion movement, as Republicans have used their majorities to push ever more aggressive restrictions in the states they control. Heavily gerrymandered state legislative districts that reduce two-party competitiveness have helped fuel a spiral in which the easiest way for a Republican candidate or lawmaker to curry favor with the party\u2019s base is to put forth increasingly radical ideas on abortion, democracy or any other right-wing pet cause.Republican legislatures have already made 2022 one of the worst years on record for abortion rights, passing a litany of restrictive laws that have followed the blueprint of Texas\u2019 S.B. 8, which effectively outlawed abortion last year. Some of those new laws don\u2019t include exceptions for rape or incest.Twenty-two states currently have laws or constitutional provisions that would likely make abortion illegal immediately if the Supreme Court overturns Roe, and four more with GOP-controlled legislatures \u2014 in Florida, Indiana, Montana and Nebraska \u2014 seem likely to join them after the ruling. Democrats, on the other hand, have raced to expand abortion rights ahead of the Supreme Court ruling. Colorado Democrats approved a law to explicitly protect abortion rights in March, and Vermont Democrats are pushing a measure that would make Vermont the first state to enshrine the right to an abortion in its constitution if California doesn\u2019t do so first. Overall, Democratic legislatures have protected the right to abortion in 16 states and Washington D.C., according to the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the party\u2019s state legislative arm, all while Democrats have never managed to codify Roe into federal law. \u201cThis should be a tough lesson for Democrats \u2013 our policymaking power in Washington is limited and the fight to protect abortion rights will now lie in state legislatures,\u201d DLCC President Jessica Post said in a statement Monday night. \u201cState legislatures are Democrats\u2019 best chance to protect abortion rights across the country when the court strikes down Roe.\u201dWhether Virginia might pursue an all-out ban or other restrictions remains an open question, one GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin largely dodged in an interview with Virginia Political Newsletter\u2019s Brandon Jarvis on Tuesday. Instead, he reiterated that he is pro-life, expressed dismay about the leak, and said he would wait until an official ruling in the case to see what he and the legislature might want to do on abortion issues.\u201cWe have to wait until the Supreme Court ruling is final before we in fact can really define where we\u2019re going to go,\u201d Youngkin said. \u201cIf this is actually the final ruling, this will be a decision the states should have.\u201d Democrats still control the Virginia state Senate by a single vote, but one member of the Democratic caucus opposes abortion. That has generated fears since last November\u2019s election that the Virginia GOP may be able to successfully implement new abortion restrictions if Republicans can craft a proposal that the lone anti-abortion Democrat will support. \u201cWhile we are all doing all that we can at this moment in time, I think that it should feel real that this is actually something that could transpire, and Virginia should be on alert and on notice,\u201d Virginia state Delegate Briana Sewell (D) told HuffPost on Tuesday.Battles over the future of abortion rights also seem likely to dominate legislative campaigns and statewide elections in major swing states.Arizona is among the states in which existing laws will likely make abortion illegal immediately. Michigan, meanwhile, has an existing law on the books but may need to pass another to fully outlaw abortion, especially amid lawsuits from Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and reproductive rights groups arguing that newer laws and constitutional provisions preempt the old statute.Both states will serve as major battlegrounds in November. Whitmer and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who has pledged not to enforce anti-abortion laws, are in the midst of tough reelection fights against Republicans who oppose reproductive rights. And President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory in Arizona has bolstered Democratic hopes that Secretary of State Katie Hobbs or another of the party\u2019s candidates can win the governor\u2019s mansion for the first time since 2006.Republicans hold tenuous control of the Michigan and Arizona state legislatures. Their 16-14 majority in the Arizona Senate and 31-29 advantage in the state House mean Democrats would need to flip a single seat in each to break the GOP majority. Republicans hold a 58-52 advantage in the Michigan state House and a 20-16 majority in the Senate, where there are two vacancies. Democrats are also seeking to win the state House majority in New Hampshire, which does not currently have a law that would ban abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe. Neither does Pennsylvania, where Democrats have their sights set on a longer-shot effort to flip the state legislature and at least hope to prevent the GOP from winning the governorship and assuming total control of the state.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, is up for reelection this year and vowed Monday night that \u201cthere will never be an abortion ban on my watch.\u201d Democrats also hope they can stave off Republican gains in the state House, where they hold the majority, and potentially pick up seats in the Senate, where the GOP narrowly holds control, to ensure no such ban materializes in the near future. In North Carolina, meanwhile, the party wants to avoid allowing the GOP to reassemble a state Senate supermajority that would allow Republicans to override Gov. Roy Cooper\u2019s (D) promised vetoes of anti-abortion legislation. State legislative success has eluded Democrats in recent cycles: They didn\u2019t win a single new legislative body in 2020 despite pouring record resources into such campaigns and have already lost control of two of the chambers they flipped during the Trump presidency. But party leaders believe that backlash to abortion bans \u2014 and an all-out overturning of Roe \u2014 could hurt Republicans, even in a midterm cycle that should naturally favor the out-party. Last September, Democrat Catherine Rombeau flipped a New Hampshire state House seat immediately after the Supreme Court declined to block the new Texas anti-abortion law, prevailing in a race in which abortion rights were \u201cthe number one issue,\u201d Post tweeted at the time. Groups like Forward Majority and the States Project, another progressive organization that focuses on state legislatures, had already begun urging voters to focus on flipping legislative chambers to combat Republican efforts to subvert elections and basic democracy. The Supreme Court\u2019s apparent move to overturn Roe and dismantle abortion rights has only further heightened the stakes.\u201cThe draft decision is clear: abortion access will be decided state-by-state, solely along the lines of state legislative control,\u201d said Simone Leiro, a spokesperson for the States Project. \u201cMake no mistake, gutting abortion access and dismantling our democracy are both about ending individual choice. Do you really think that bounties for turning in your neighbor, being punished for what you do in another state, and going to prison for doing your job will end at the womb?\u201dAmanda Terkel contributed reporting.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 The first multistate contest of the 2022 midterm election season  unfolds on Tuesday, as Ohio voters pick nominees for governor and the U.S. Senate while Indiana voters consider whether their Legislature should become even more conservative.The races, particularly in Ohio, could provide a fresh window into former President Donald Trump\u2019s sway among the party faithful. He has been especially involved in Ohio\u2019s Senate primary, which has been marred by Republican divisions, along with campaigns for the U.S. House and secretary of state.For Democrats, a potential threat to incumbent U.S. Rep. Shontel Brown  in Cleveland is of keen interest. Brown is locked in a rematch against progressive challenger Nina Turner, a former state senator and surrogate for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaigns. Turner is trying again after losing to Brown in last year\u2019s special election.Voting in Ohio comes against the backdrop of a chaotic and still unresolved redistricting battle.What to watch as the Ohio and Indiana primaries unfold:Seven candidates are on the ballot in Tuesday\u2019s Republican faceoff for the coveted open U.S. Senate seat of retiring Republican Rob Portman. They are Trump-endorsed \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author JD Vance, former Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, Cleveland investment banker Mike Gibbons, former Ohio Republican Chair Jane Timken, state Sen. Matt Dolan, whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, and entrepreneurs Mark Pukita and Neil Patel.The campaign has featured months of jockeying among top contenders for Trump\u2019s endorsement, more than $65 million in TV and radio spending, dozens of debates and candidate forums, and one highly publicized physical confrontation between two candidates.As Vance rides high on the Trump endorsement, other candidates who campaigned on their loyalty to the former president are hoping that heavy ad spending or a strong ground game can help them win. Dolan is the only candidate who ran as a Portman-like centrist, but Timken landed Portman\u2019s endorsement.Whoever prevails will face the winner of a three-way Democratic primary between 10-term U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, former consumer protection attorney Morgan Harper and Columbus activist and tech exec Traci Johnson.Trump twice won Ohio by more than 8 percentage points, so many viewed getting his nod in the Senate race as critical to winning the crowded Senate primary. Instead, when he finally chose Vance, it divided the state.That\u2019s because Vance opponents, including Mandel, Gibbons and their allies, had aired months of ads highlighting Vance\u2019s past anti-Trump statements. Some tea party Republicans protested an April 23 Trump rally featuring Vance, and one conservative group, Ohio Value Voters, urged its supporters to boycott \u2014 or boo Vance when he walked on stage. The deep-pocketed Club for Growth, a conservative group backing Mandel, has taken to TV with ads directly attacking Trump for his choice.Trump also has backed candidates in two Republican congressional primaries: Max Miller, his former White House and campaign aide, in the sprawling new 7th District in northeast Ohio, and Madison Gesiotto Gilbert in the Akron-area 13th District. He also is backing Secretary of State Frank LaRose in his primary against former state Rep. John Adams, a conservative Trump supporter.Democrat Nan Whaley is seeking to be the first woman in Ohio  to get a major party\u2019s nomination for governor. The former Dayton mayor is locked in a tight race with ex-Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley, who is endorsed by feminist icon Gloria Steinem.They see eye-to-eye on most major issues \u2014 guns, abortion rights, social justice \u2014 but Whaley has repeatedly pointed out that Cranley only recently said he was pro-choice. She also has the backing of the state\u2019s top Democrat, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown.Neither candidate is a household name across Ohio. Both have struggled to draw attention as much of the state is focused on the contentious U.S. Senate race and ongoing redistricting fight.The big question for first-term Republican Gov. Mike DeWine is just how many conservative voters will punish him for pushing aggressive mandates  and shutdowns during the pandemic.DeWine is widely known from a 40-year career in Ohio politics and in a solid position to win the GOP\u2019s nomination for another four-year term. His two main challengers have tapped into the anger over the governor\u2019s COVID-19 policies, but they\u2019re likely to split those far-right voters.DeWine isn\u2019t taking any chances, pouring millions into advertising during the weeks leading into the primary. The concern will be whether those same conservative voters who were furious with DeWine will come back to him in November.A protracted battle over Ohio\u2019s congressional and legislative maps has played havoc with the state\u2019s 2022 election calendar. For a long time, it looked like the May 3 primary wouldn\u2019t go forward amid all the legal wrangling. Then suddenly it did.Voter advocates, campaigns and political parties have stepped up efforts to get the word out as participation in early voting showed a 40% decline from four years ago.Tuesday\u2019s ballots will not list state legislative races, which are expected to be decided in a second primary later this year. The Ohio Redistricting Commission faces a deadline next week to try for a fifth time to draw district lines that don\u2019t represent a partisan gerrymander and can meet constitutional muster. If the panel fails, a federal court has said it will force an Aug. 2 primary using one of the previously invalidated maps.Congressional races have gone forward using a map that has also been invalidated by the Ohio Supreme Court. Ongoing litigation could result in a new map before 2024 elections.More than a dozen Indiana House members are trying to hold off Republican primary challengers who argue that the GOP-dominated Legislature hasn\u2019t been aggressive enough on issues from attempting to ban abortion to overturning COVID-19 restrictions that were ordered by the state\u2019s Republican governor.Those challengers say they are tapping into frustration among conservative voters and want to push the Legislature further to the right in a state where Republicans control all statewide offices and have had legislative supermajorities for the past decade.Whether the challengers can defeat incumbents backed by Republican leaders\u2019 multimillion-dollar campaign fund should be answered in Tuesday\u2019s primary.Republican legislative leaders argue the \u201cno compromise\u201d stances adopted by many challengers aren\u2019t practical and tout the state\u2019s low taxes and unemployment and broad private school voucher program among its conservative successes.Challengers like Brittany Carroll, a family law attorney running for a central Indiana seat, maintain Indiana lawmakers should be aggressively pushing issues such as the Texas ban on abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy.\u201cIndiana could be leading in terms of liberty, like Florida, like Texas,\u201d Carroll said.___Davies reported from Indianapolis.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostIf the Supreme Court follows through on its stunning draft opinion and strikes down Roe v. Wade, the fight for abortion access in the immediate future will hinge on several competitive gubernatorial races ahead of the midterm elections. Since each state would get to set its own rules on abortion in a post-Roe world \u2014 and many red states have already passed legislation that would ban abortion if the Supreme Court reverses the nearly 50-year precedent \u2014 control of state capitals will be more critical than ever. Battleground states such as Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were already expected to hold high-profile races for governor, with bitter partisan fights emerging over education, transgender rights, COVID-19 restrictions and the economy. But the issue of abortion could take things to another level entirely. This is especially true in states with GOP-controlled legislatures, like Michigan and Pennsylvania.Michigan still has a 1931 law on the books that bans abortions, including in cases of rape and incest, that would go into effect if the Supreme Court struck down Roe.Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Democratic Lt. Gov. Dana Nessel have said they wouldn\u2019t enforce the law even if Roe were struck down. But several of their potential GOP challengers have said they would.Pennsylvania does not have a similar law on the books, but that could change if a Republican wins the gubernatorial election and the state\u2019s GOP legislature passes an abortion ban.Democratic Gov.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Trends Reporter, HuffPostRep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) on Monday evoked the dystopia of a full-on \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d after a draft majority opinion by the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade was published by Politico.\u201cRoe was egregiously wrong from the start,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the document, per Politico. \u201cWe hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled \u2026 It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people\u2019s elected representatives.\u201dIn an interview with Rachel Maddow, Raskin, a constitutional lawyer, called the leaked opinion \u201castonishing and appalling\u201d and said it would eliminate all rights to abortion. \u201cIt situates the trajectory of the American right where Fox News and Tucker Carlson want to go, which is to make us in the image of Hungarian \u2018illiberal\u2019 democracy now. To keep elections going, where people can be whipped up about various scapegoats. But to carve out and destroy the freedoms and the rights of the people,\u201d said Raskin. The court\u2019s official ruling on the matter will only be final once it\u2019s published, and justices can change their votes up until then, meaning nothing is yet decided.Raskin agreed with the draft opinion that the word \u201cabortion\u201d does not appear in the Constitution \u2014 nor does \u201ccontraception\u201d or the phrase \u201cright to privacy\u201d \u2014 though that doesn\u2019t mean those rights should not be protected. Roe v. Wade was based on an earlier 1965 ruling striking down a law banning birth control, stating that the Constitution\u2019s \u201cdue process liberty clause includes a right to privacy over intimate decision-making,\u201d Raskin said. If Roe falls, that would also threaten the right to contraception and privacy.The draft opinion \u201cwould appear to be an invitation to have \u2018Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2019-type anti-feminist regulation and legislation all over the country,\u201d said Raskin, referring to Margaret Atwood\u2019s novel about a future in which women are forced to give birth by a government run by men.Raskin also said that the draft opinion signals a return of the Supreme Court to its \u201chistoric baseline of being a reactionary, conservative institution to the far right of everything else at the federal level in the government.\u201dCheck out Raskin\u2019s full interview in the video clip above.Trends Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Breaking News Reporter, HuffPostPresident Joe Biden said Tuesday that his administration will continue fighting in defense of Roe v. Wade, after a Supreme Court draft opinion striking down the landmark ruling was leaked.\u201cI believe that a woman\u2019s right to choose is fundamental, Roe has been the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned,\u201d Biden said in a statement.Biden said he did not know if the draft was authentic or whether it reflected the final decision.He added that he has ordered his Gender Policy Council and the White House Counsel\u2019s Office to prepare options to respond to the continued attack on abortion and reproductive rights, after the Supreme Court allowed a Texas law known as SB. 8 \u2014 which effectively bans abortion at six weeks \u2014 to go into effect in September.\u201cWe will be ready when any ruling is issued,\u201d he said.\u201cIf the Court does overturn Roe, it will fall on our nation\u2019s elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman\u2019s right to choose,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November. At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice Senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law.\u201dPolitico published the draft opinion, authored by conservative Justice Samuel Alito, Monday evening. The president issued the statement Tuesday morning ahead of a visit to Alabama, where he planned to tour a Lockheed Martin factory that produces Javelin antitank missiles that the U.S. is providing Ukraine to help defend against Russia\u2019s invasion.Alito wrote that the reasoning behind the Roe decision \u2014 which established a constitutional right for Americans to seek an abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 was \u201cexceptionally weak\u201d and \u201chas had damaging consequences.\u201d He also appeared to take issue with the court\u2019s decision in the 1992 Planned Parenthood v.

Besides Texas and Arizona, the group is also working in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania this cycle. It also is trying to help Democratic campaigns hire more diverse campaign staff, a major goal for candidates hoping to live up to the party\u2019s increased focus on racial justice. Arena launched after the 2016 elections and has trained more than 6,200 Democratic staffers and volunteers since then. More than half of those have been women and more than half have been racial minorities, while roughly a third have been LGBTQ individuals.\u201cWe are very intentional about who we train, precisely because Democrats have not been intentional about this for so many years,\u201d Baer said. The group will also directly fund roughly 40 organizers in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Texas who will work on state legislative and county-level races, the continuation of a program it first launched for last year\u2019s elections in Virginia. In Virginia, despite Democratic losses at the top of the ticket, the party won four of the seven state legislative races where Arena placed staffers, including a narrow 400-vote victory in one.It\u2019s also hosting mass trainings for more than 125 people in Arizona later this month and 600 people in Texas in June.Baer, a former U.S. House candidate in Florida, said Democrats need to focus more on building long-term infrastructure than on pouring money into individual candidates\u2019 campaign coffers.\u201cFor far too long, Democrats have had what I think I would call a shiny object problem, which is to say, we like to become enamored with and invest in \u2014 sometimes over-invest in \u2014 candidates,\u201d Baer said. \u201cAnd we do that to the detriment of building the kind of long-term, permanent, on-the-ground power and infrastructure that is needed to win year over year.\u201dSenior Political Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The film, adapted from Aaron Blabey\u2019s kids\u2019 graphic novel, has helped reignite family moviegoing.April moviegoing was largely dominated by Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 2\u201d \u2014 which stayed in second place with $11.4 million, bringing its cumulative total to $160.9 million \u2014 and \u201cThe Bad Guys,\u201d with $44.4 million in two weeks.The latest Neeson thriller, \u201cMemory,\u201d however, was mostly forgotten by moviegoers. The Open Road-Briarcliffe Entertainment R-rated release launched with an estimated $3.1 million in 2,555 locations. That\u2019s much in line with the last few films staring Neeson. In the past two years, \u201cBlacklight\u201d (a $3.5 million debut), \u201cHonest Thief\u201d ($4.1 million) and \u201cThe Marksman\u201d ($3.1 million) all opened similarly.The last Neeson thriller to make a dent was 2019\u2032s \u201cCold Pursuit,\u201d which debuted with $11 million and ultimately grossed $62.6 million worldwide. But either due to oversaturation or lackluster reception (\u201cMemory\u201d has a 30% \u201cfresh\u201d rating on Rotten Tomatoes\u201d), a once dependable box-office force has gone cold.\u201cNeeson\u2019s pre-pandemic crime pics did well, including the successful \u2018Taken\u2019 series, but audiences are showing little interest now,\u201d David A.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 A top-level U.S. congressional delegation led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised the \u201cferocity\u201d and resolve of Ukrainians face to face with their leader in a weekend visit to Kyiv undertaken in extraordinary secrecy.Pelosi, second in line to the presidency after the vice president, was the most senior American lawmaker to visit Ukraine since Russia\u2019s war began more than two months ago. Only days earlier, Russia bombed the Ukrainian capital while the U.N. secretary-general was there.Pelosi and the half dozen U.S. lawmakers with her met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and his top aides for three hours late Saturday to voice American solidarity with the besieged nation and get a first-hand assessment of the effort as she works to steer a massive new Ukraine aid package through Congress.\u201cOur commitment is to be there for you until the fight is done,\u201d Pelosi is seen telling Zelenskyy in a video of the meeting released by his office. \u201cWe are on a frontier of freedom and your fight is a fight for everyone. Thank you for your fight for freedom.\u201d\u201cYou all are welcome,\u201d Zelenskyy told the delegation.Pelosi told reporters in Poland on Sunday the delegation was proud to convey to Zelenskyy \u201cthe message of unity from the Congress of the United States, a message of appreciation from the American people for his leadership and admiration for the people of Ukraine for their courage.\u201d She is set to meet Polish President Andrzej Duda, a NATO ally, on Monday in Warsaw.The delegation\u2019s trip to Kyiv was not disclosed until the party was safely out of Ukraine. Nor were details given on how they got to the capital and back. A week earlier, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin Zelenskyy traveled to Kyiv overland from Poland for talks with Zelenskyy.The members of the congressional delegation were unanimous in praising Ukraine\u2019s defenses, in painting the battle of one as good against evil and in assuring continued long-term U.S. military, humanitarian and economic support.\u201cThis is a struggle of freedom against tyranny,\u201d said Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence committee.The trip came two days after U.S. President Joe Biden asked Congress for $33 billion to bolster Ukraine\u2019s fight against Russia, more than twice the size of the initial $13.6 billion aid measure that now is almost drained. The measure is designed to signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that U.S. weaponry and other forms of assistance aren\u2019t going away.Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, a veteran and a member of the House intelligence and armed services committees, said he went to Ukraine with three areas of focus: \u201cWeapons, weapons and weapons.\u201d\u201cWe have to make sure the Ukrainians have what they need to win,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we have seen in the last two months is their ferocity, their intense pride, their ability to fight and their ability to win if they have the support to do so.\u201dScores of U.S. lawmakers are trekking to the region to witness first hand the war\u2019s toll and shore up U.S. troops in the broader region. Pelosi\u2019s delegation was notable for the seniority of its members.The trip also underscored Pelosi\u2019s stature as an ambassador on the global stage. The speaker is well known in Europe and elsewhere abroad, typically leads travel delegations and keeps close relations with allies overseas.Though all in the delegation were Democrats, the U.S. Congress has displayed a rare and, so far, lasting bipartisan resolve to back Ukraine as it battles Russia. Pelosi has branded the war a conflict between democracy and autocracy and vowed Washington will stand with Ukraine until it defeats the invaders.Pelosi came with Rep. Gregory Meeks, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee; Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, chair of the House Rules Committee; Reps. Barbara Lee of California and Bill Keating of Massachusetts, Crow and Schiff.\u201cThis is a time we stand up for democracy or we allow autocracy to rule the day,\u201d Meeks said. Crow said the U.S. \u201cis in this to win, and we will stand with Ukraine until victory is won.\u201dSchiff, as intelligence panel chair, said he was particularly focused on making sure Ukraine is getting the U.S. intelligence support it needs to \u201cdefeat Russian forces.\u201dThe delegation\u2019s visit followed those of several EU officials and European heads of state who have gone to show solidarity with Zelenskyy, starting with the March 15 surprise visit by the leaders of NATO members Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia.More recently, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres met Zelenskyy in Kyiv on Thursday. A missile strike rained down on the capital barely an hour after their joint press conference, an attack Kyiv\u2019s mayor said was Putin giving his \u201cmiddle finger\u201d to Guterres.The delegation was visiting southeast Poland and going later to the capital. Poland has received more than 3 million refugees from Ukraine since Russia launched its war on Feb. 24.\u201cWe look forward to thanking our Polish allies for their dedication and humanitarian efforts,\u201d Pelosi said.McGovern said Russia\u2019s war had repercussions far beyond Ukraine and was exacerbating a food crisis that would be disastrous for poor people across the globe.\u201cPutin\u2019s brutal war is no longer only a war against the people of Ukraine,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a war against the world\u2019s most vulnerable.\u201dHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t think that Putin cares if he starves the world.\u201d___Winfield reported from Rome, Mascaro from Washington.___A previous version of this story was corrected to show that Pelosi is second in line to the presidency, not third.___More AP coverage of the war at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin is publicly backing a moderate Republican lawmaker in a U.S. House primary that pits two incumbents in West Virginia. The senator appeared in a campaign ad released Friday, supporting Rep. David McKinley over his Trump-endorsed opponent, Rep. Alex Mooney.In the 30-second ad, Manchin said McKinley \u201chas always opposed reckless spending because it doesn\u2019t make sense for West Virginia.\u201d The Democrat added that Mooney \u201chas proven he\u2019s all about Alex Mooney. But West Virginians know David McKinley is all about us.\u201dThe argument of \u201creckless spending\u201d comes as McKinley claims that Mooney is misleading voters about the former\u2019s vote for President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law. Mooney voted against it, and in one ad attacked McKinley for \u201cbacking Biden for a trillion-dollar spending spree.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve always said if I can\u2019t go home and explain it, I can\u2019t vote for it.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows accused the congressional committee investigating last year\u2019s attack on the U.S. Capitol of leaking all of the text messages he provided to the panel in what he says was an effort to vilify him publicly.The argument was made in a filing Friday in Washington\u2019s federal court, where Meadows  sued in December to invalidate subpoenas issued to him for his testimony and to Verizon for his cell phone records.In the latest filing, lawyers for Meadows asked a judge to reject the committee\u2019s request for a court ruling in its favor that could force Meadows to comply with the subpoenas. The committee requested an expedited briefing schedule Wednesday after filing its motion the previous week.The lawyers say Meadows deserves a chance through the fact-gathering process known as discovery to gather information about questions that are still in dispute, such as the committee\u2019s claims that former President Donald Trump did not properly invoke executive privilege over the items subpoenaed by the panel because he did not communicate that position directly to the committee.\u201cMr. Meadows cannot possibly know whether that unsupported contention is true without discovery \u2014 or whether the Select Committee had awareness of former President Trump\u2019s assertions,\u201d the motion states. It adds that Meadows must have the ability to obtain any communications between the committee and Trump and possibly to take depositions of people familiar with those discussions.The House voted in December to hold Meadows in criminal contempt after he ceased cooperating, referring the matter to the Justice Department, which has not said whether it will take action. Meadows\u2019 legal team has said he provided extensive cooperation but that the committee refused to respect Trump\u2019s assertion of executive privilege.The motion by Meadows also accuses the committee of waging a \u201csustained media campaign\u201d against him. Though it does not provide evidence, it says the committee has leaked all of the text messages Meadows has produced to the committee.\u201cThe Congressional Defendants, under the auspices of a legitimate subpoena, induced Mr. Meadows to produce thousands of his private communications only to use them in a concerted and ongoing effort to vilify him publicly through the media,\u201d Meadows\u2019 attorney, George Terwilliger, wrote in the motion.Court filings by the committee have shown how Meadows was in regular contact before Jan. 6, 2021, with Republican allies who advanced false claims of election fraud and supported overturning the results of the race won by President Joe Biden. A filing a week ago cited testimony from a White House aide  who said Meadows had been advised beforehand that there could be violence on Jan. 6.The committee declined through a spokesperson to comment Saturday about Meadows\u2019 accusations against the panel.____Associated Press writer Farnoush Amiri in Washington contributed to this report.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A judge on Friday threw out part of the case against Kim Kardashian in former reality TV star Blac Chyna\u2019s lawsuit while the jury deliberates on the elements that remain.Judge Gregory Alarcon ruled that Chyna\u2019s attorney Lynne Ciani did not provide any statement during the trial from Kardashian that was defamatory toward Chyna.The case against Kardashian for interference with a contract remains alive. The jury is deciding on that and both defamation and contract-interference cases against Kris Jenner, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kylie Jenner.Jurors went home Friday without reaching a verdict after their first full day of deliberations. Their instructions had to be revised after the Kim Kardashian decision, and attorneys and the judge gave answered several questions that they submitted. They\u2019re scheduled to resume Monday morning.Chyna\u2019s lawsuit alleges that the women falsely told television producers and executives that Chyna had violently attacked her then-fianc\u00e9 Rob Kardashian in December 2016 in an attempt to get her reality show, \u201cRob & Chyna,\u201d canceled.Ciani argued during closing arguments Thursday afternoon that the women had no reason to believe the attack had occurred, as testimony, photos and video from the time showed no significant injuries to Rob Kardashian.\u201cHe didn\u2019t have a mark on him,\u201d Ciani said. \u201cThere was no call to the police, no trip to the hospital, not even a Band-Aid.\u201dKardashian attorney Michael G. Rhodes argued during his closing that the women had every reason to believe the accounts of the attack from Rob Kardashian and from Kris Jenner\u2019s longtime boyfriend Corey Gamble, who broke up the dispute and was a key defense witness.\u201cDo you remember how Rob looked on the stand yesterday? His pain was real,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cThis is a real family. Yeah, they\u2019re famous, but they\u2019re real people. He got really badly hurt here.\u201dCiani provided clear examples of statements via text messages and emails from Kris Jenner, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, telling the show\u2019s producers and the E! network, which the show appeared on, about the abuse allegation.But the case she made against Kim Kardashian was more vague.After Alarcon read the jury its instructions Thursday, Rhodes pointed out that there was no potentially defamatory statement in them from Kim Kardashian.Ciani was angered by the assertion, but the frustrated judge rebuked her, saying she had agreed to the jury instructions before the trial began.A similar argument emerged in court Friday over Alarcon\u2019s unusual method of jury selection. Instead of choosing 12 jurors and four alternates, the judge had the lawyers select 16 jurors, then chose by random drawing after closing arguments which four were the alternates. The judge again pointed out to Ciani that she had agreed to the process before trial.In the civil case, nine of the 12 jurors will need to agree on whether three of the Kardashian defendants either knowingly lied about Chyna abusing Rob Kardashian, or spread the word about it with reckless disregard for the truth. The same number will need to decide whether each of the four illegally interfered with Chyna\u2019s contract with the E! network.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Rob Kardashian testified Wednesday that he feared for his life on a night in 2016 when his then-fianc\u00e9e Blac Chyna pointed a gun at his head, pulled a phone-charging cable around his neck and repeatedly hit him with a metal rod while under the influence of substances.\u201cShe strangled me, she put a gun to my head twice, she was on cocaine and alcohol,\u201d Kardashian said, his voice rising nearly to a shout in a Los Angeles courtroom as Chyna\u2019s attorney Lynne Ciani sought to cast doubt on the attack and its severity.Chyna is suing Rob Kardashian\u2019s mother Kris Jenner and sisters Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, alleging they spread false reports of her assaulting him in order to have her \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d spinoff \u201cRob & Chyna\u201d canceled and ruin her reality TV career.During an emotional and contentious hour on the stand, Rob Kardashian grew angry when Ciani asked him why photos and video from the days that followed didn\u2019t show any marks on him, despite his testimony that she had hit him repeatedly with a 6-foot metal rod.\u201cDid you have as much as a Band-Aid on you?\u201d the attorney asked.\u201cI just told you it didn\u2019t leave a mark on my face!\u201d Rob Kardashian said. \u201cAnd the gun to my head two different times during the night didn\u2019t leave a mark to my temple!\u201dKris Jenner and Kim Kardashian watched the testimony from the front row of the gallery, and had no visible reaction. Chyna testified earlier in the trial that she was never violent toward Rob Kardashian.She said that on the night of Dec. 14 and the morning of Dec. 15, 2016, the couple had been celebrating the news that \u201cRob & Chyna\u201d was getting a second season.The all-night celebration turned into a bitter fight by morning, when he took her phone and shut himself in a closet, looking for evidence of communications with other men, she said.She testified that earlier in the evening, she had wrapped a phone-charging cord around Rob Kardashian\u2019s neck playfully because he was ignoring her, and picked up a gun he kept around, always unloaded, from a nightstand as a joke.The chain of events would lead to the end of the relationship, and their show.Rob Kardashian, 35, the youngest of Kris Jenner\u2019s four children with the late Robert Kardashian, has kept a much lower public profile than his mother and sisters. He was mostly an offscreen character, and only occasionally appeared, on the family\u2019s reality show.He broke from the pattern in 2016, spending a year in the limelight before it went bad. He and Chyna began dating in January, announced their engagement in April, announced they were having a child together in May, had their own reality show premiere in September, and had a daughter, Dream, in November.He testified Wednesday that he felt in retrospect that their love was never real, and that he had been at the \u201cweakest, worst point\u201d in his life when their relationship began. He said the coupling was \u201ctoxic\u201d from the start, and that she beat him at least five times during the yearlong relationship. \u201cStrangling someone, beating someone, that\u2019s not a family,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not love to me.\u201dRob Kardashian wore a loose-fitting, untucked black dress shirt on the stand. His otherwise dark testimony drew a laugh from most of the courtroom when Ciani suggested that two videos she showed were shot on the same day because he was wearing the same thing.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d he said. \u201cI wear the same thing every day.\u201dRob Kardashian is not a defendant in this trial. Chyna\u2019s allegations against him, stemming from the same incidents, will get a separate trial when this one is done.Earlier Wednesday, Corey Gamble, a key witness backing up Rob Kardashian\u2019s account of the assault, insisted that he saw Chyna punch him and whip him with a phone-charging cord, as Ciani tried to poke holes in his story.\u201cI said that she attacked him,\u201d testified Gamble, the longtime boyfriend and sometime co-star of \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d matriarch Kris Jenner. \u201cWhat I saw is what I saw.\u201dGamble said he rushed to the house the couple was staying in after Kris Jenner got an early morning call from her son, who sounded deeply distressed.When he arrived, he said, Chyna was holding some sort of metal rod, and threw it down. She rushed toward Rob Kardashian, whipping the phone cord at him then punching him.\u201cBy the time she got to him, she started hitting him,\u201d Gamble testified. \u201dI was able to get in the middle of them two. I even got hit two or three times.\u201dGamble said Chyna threw a chair at Rob Kardashian\u2019s car as he was leaving, then attempted to pick up a table but Gamble stopped her.During cross-examination, Ciani had Gamble read from a declaration he submitted in the case two years earlier, in which he said he arrived to find Chyna hitting Rob Kardashian with her fists, but made no mention of any of the objects.\u201cYou didn\u2019t see sufficient to mention the metal rod, the cord or the table?\u201d Ciani asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t include those details,\u201d Gamble said.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostEvan McLaren, who played a pivotal role in the American white supremacist \u201calt-right\u201d movement and attended a deadly fascist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017, published a surprise statement Thursday renouncing his past racist and anti-Semitic activism.\u201cI am not and never will be connected to the far-right again,\u201d McLaren wrote in the statement, published on Substack. \u201cMy revulsion for conservatism and the political right wing is total. I reject and disavow my past actions, views, and associations.\u201dHuffPost spoke with McLaren by phone Thursday morning as he drove to work from his new home in Norway. He affirmed that the statement was authentic. It makes him one of the most high-profile defectors from right-wing extremism in recent memory.In his statement, McLaren, 37, said he is sorry for his white nationalist activism \u2015 which he described as \u201ca desperate, foolish mistake, damaging to others, to myself, and to society\u201d \u2014 but says he doesn\u2019t expect, and isn\u2019t asking for, any kind of absolution.\u201cI apologize to everyone who was affected in any way by my past activities,\u201d he wrote in the Substack statement. \u201cThe main purpose of this statement, however, is not to apologize. I do not realistically expect to repair my public reputation, to the extent that it meaningfully exists, or to heal rifts with people I have alienated. I don\u2019t hope or expect to be forgiven.\u201dIn 2017 McLaren was named executive director of the National Policy Institute, a racist think tank \u2014 funded by a reclusive millionaire \u2014 that sought to give white supremacism an intellectual veneer so as to better fold explicit ethnonationalism into the mainstream Republican Party.At NPI, McLaren was the right-hand man of the group\u2019s leader, Richard Spencer, and helped organize a series of events that became flashpoints in the rise of the so-called \u201calt-right,\u201d the American fascist movement that proliferated online during the ascendancy of former President Donald Trump.McLaren and Spencer were among the white men who infamously marched with torches across the campus of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville the night of Aug. 11, 2017, chanting \u201cYou will not replace us!\u201d and the Nazi slogan \u201cBlood and soil!\u201dThe next day, McLaren and Spencer participated in the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, the largest American white supremacist gathering in over a generation, which culminated with a neo-Nazi driving his car into a crowd of antifascist protesters, killing one woman and injuring 19 people. McLaren was arrested during the day\u2019s events and later convicted on a charge of failing to disperse from a park after being ordered to do so by police.\u201cBrothers and sisters across the alt-right \u2014 this is a taste of how it feels to be the tip of the spear entering our civilizational crisis,\u201d McLaren tweeted a day after the violence in Charlottesville.During his tenure at NPI, McLaren frequently talked to the media, sometimes attempting to soften the alt-right\u2019s image.\u201cWe\u2019re not Nazis. We\u2019re not Confederates. We\u2019re not KKK members,\u201d he told PennLive in 2017, weeks after marching alongside Nazis, neo-Confederates and KKK members in Charlottesville. \u201cWe\u2019re dedicated to the preservation of white heritage and identity. We\u2019re talking about European culture and identity.\u201d McLaren clarified in other statements at the time that he did not consider Jewish people to be white.Through late 2017 and into 2018, McLaren helped organize speaking engagements for Spencer at college campuses, including Michigan State University and the University of Florida, events that both involved violence. Following the event in Florida, three fans of Spencer were arrested after one of them fired a gun at protesters.Around this time, McLaren, originally from central Pennsylvania, passed the state bar exam and was poised to begin practicing law. \u201cHail victory!\u201d he tweeted in celebration, using the English translation of the Nazi cry \u201cSieg heil!\u201dBut by the summer of 2018, McLaren says he\u2019d started to grow disillusioned with NPI, an organization he described to HuffPost as an \u201cutter wreck and a mess.\u201d He also described Spencer as \u201ctoxic.\u201dMcLaren resigned from NPI in August 2018 and later moved to Norway, where, he says, he slowly began \u201cdeconstructing and thinking through\u201d white nationalism, a movement that he says he realized \u201cwas leading nowhere and is leading nowhere.\u201dMcLaren said his eventual rejection of white nationalism doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s now a moderate conservative or Republican. Rather, he told HuffPost, he sees white nationalism and conservatism in America as inextricably linked movements that feed off of and energize each other. (This relationship, he thinks, has intensified since he left the alt-right.) He describes his views today as leftist.A handful of other prominent alt-right figures involved in the Charlottesville rally later claimed to renounce their far-right activism. Jeff Schoep, former leader of the neo-Nazi group National Socialist Movement, and Matt Heimbach, former leader of the Traditionalist Workers Party, both professed to disavow white nationalism.However, those disavowals drew intense skepticism from observers across the political spectrum, and with good reason. Evidence emerged in a Charlottesville-related lawsuit that suggested Schoep was still involved in the movement, and Heimbach eventually appeared to abandon any pretense of having given up on extremism -- relaunching his hate group under a different name, and telling one media outlet: \"Do I particularly like Judaism as a religion? No.\"Over the past few years, McLaren has kept a low, offline profile at his new home in Norway, where he lives with his wife and child. He declined to name his employer, but said he works at a \u201cproduction\u201d job. He listens to leftist podcasts like \u201cMajority Report\u201d and \u201cSome More News\u201d and focuses his time on his family, his hobbies and fixing his house.McLaren said that a few recent incidents, which he didn\u2019t describe in detail, compelled him to break his silence on Thursday \u2015 even if, as his statement acknowledges, \u201cit\u2019s likely that the best move for someone who messed up as badly as I did is simply to go away and be quiet.\u201d\u201cThat people may assume I still hold radical views or remain actively connected to far-right political causes concerns me,\u201d McLaren wrote in the statement. \u201cI would understand, for example, if people in my local community who learned about me might worry about what I am up to, whether I hold and promote extremist views, or whether I\u2019ll resume disruptive political activity in the future. Possibly worse, in my daily life I occasionally encounter Trump supporters, closet racists, and right-wingers of various stripes who learn about me and assume that I am some sort of sympathetic fellow traveler.\u201d McLaren\u2019s statement concludes with the hope that in the future, people who search his name online might, after reading all the news stories about him, also find his disavowal of it all.\u201cMy only purpose here,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis that, on those occasions when someone happens to explore the Internet search results related to my name, they might also find this statement as an indication that, while I was a source of toxic energy and opinions in the past, I am at least not that anymore.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPost"}

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A host of celebrities and comedy royalty will gather Sunday night at the Kennedy Center as comedian, talk show host and political influencer Jon Stewart receives the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in humor.Stewart, the 23rd recipient of the prize, will be honored by testimonials and skits from fellow comedians and previous Mark Twain recipients. Stewart himself spoke during Dave Chappelle\u2019s Mark Twain ceremony in 2019.The 59-year-old Stewart \u2014 born Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz \u2014 rose to prominence as a standup comic and host of multiple failed talk shows before taking over Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d in 1999. His 16-year run as \u201cDaily Show\u201d host turned him into a cultural and political force as Stewart trained his satirical eye on both politics and an increasingly polarized national media.In perhaps his most iconic moment, Stewart went on CNN\u2019s popular \u201cCrossfire\u201d debate show in 2004 and challenged the show\u2019s entire premise of left-wing vs. right-wing debate. Stewart told co-hosts Tucker Carlson and Paul Begala they had a \u201cresponsibility to the public discourse\u201d that they were cheapening with insincere political role-playing.Stewart\u2019s appearance rocketed him to new levels of prominence and political relevance and may have sealed the fate of \u201cCrossfire,\u201d which was canceled three months later.Since retiring from \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d in 2015, Stewart has become a vocal proponent of a number of social causes and one of the most prominent voices in support of health care for Sept. 11 first responders in New York City. He recently returned to television as host of \u201cThe Problem with Jon Stewart\u201d on Apple TV+.When Stewart\u2019s selection was announced in January, Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter hailed his body of work as \u201cequal parts entertainment and truth.\u201dRutter said Stewart\u2019s career \u201cdemonstrates that we all can make a difference in this world through humor, humanity, and patriotism.\u201dThis will be the first Mark Twain ceremony since Chappelle\u2019s in 2019. The award skipped 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Aside from that two-year break, the prize has been presented annually since 1998, with Richard Pryor receiving the first honors.Other recipients include Carol Burnett (the oldest recipient at age 80), Tina Fey (the youngest at age 40), Eddie Murphy, Jonathan Winters, George Carlin and Lily Tomlin. 2009 recipient Bill Cosby had his prize rescinded in 2018 amid multiple allegations of sexual assault.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 22 years and eight months behind bars, Variety reported.He has denied the allegations and pleaded not guilty to all charges in November 2020.During a preliminary hearing in the Lanez case last year, however, Los Angeles Police Department detective Ryan Stogner said Stallion told him at the time that Lanez \u201coffered her money and begged her to please not say anything,\u201d telling her that he was on probation.The Canadian rapper was arrested again earlier this month after a judge ruled that his social media posts directed at Stallion violated a protective order that required him not to have any contact with the rapper. Lanez has since posted bail and been released from custody.The next court hearing will be in September.Stallion seemingly addressed her legal battle with Lanez in a fiery new track titled \u201cPlan B\u201d she first unveiled at Coachella and then dropped last week; it has left fans heavily speculating over its lyrics. \u201cThis song is very motherfucking personal to me,\u201d she said from the festival\u2019s stage. \u201cIt\u2019s to whom the fuck it may concern, and I really feel like my ladies will fuck with me on this one.\u201dListen to the song below.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostNearly a year after President Joe Biden\u2019s administration expressed support for waiving international intellectual property rules for COVID-19 vaccines, U.S. officials are nudging the World Trade Organization and its member nations to release the draft text of such a waiver.The U.S. Trade Representative, in a diplomatically worded statement provided to HuffPost, aims to move along a process that has stalled. The Biden administration wants WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala to release an official draft of a waiver agreement so the administration can seek input on it from members of Congress and take other steps needed before it can be adopted, according to two administration officials.\u201cSince last May, [the office of the U.S. Trade Representative] has worked hard to facilitate an outcome on intellectual property that can achieve consensus across the 164 Members of the World Trade Organization to help end the pandemic,\u201d Adam Hodge, assistant U.S. trade representative for public affairs, said in the statement. USTR joined discussions led by the WTO with South Africa, India and the European Union \u201cto try to break the deadlock,\u201d he continued.\u201cWhile no agreement on text has been reached, the U.S. will continue to engage with WTO Members as part of the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s comprehensive effort to get as many safe and effective vaccines to as many people as fast as possible,\u201d added Hodge, a spokesperson for U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai.Hodge\u2019s statement is timed to precede the next major WTO gathering, suggesting a potential deadline for an officially sanctioned text. Trade representatives of WTO member nations are due to convene in person in Geneva in mid-June. A draft of a possible compromise accord between representatives of the U.S., the European Union, South Africa, and the WTO leadership leaked in March, but the parties have yet to publicize an official text. The Biden administration believes that making such a text public, even if it is not final, is necessary to advance the ratification process, according to the two administration officials. Tai announced in May 2021 that the administration would be withdrawing its objections to a waiver of trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights for COVID-19 vaccines. Global advocates for affordable medicines celebrated the decision at the time as an important, albeit preliminary, step toward expanding access to vaccines in the developing world.Tai\u2019s announcement came in response to appeals from a group of developing nations led by South Africa and India. The developing nations had pressed wealthier countries to grant the limited waiver so that generic drugmakers would be free to replicate not only the patents for Western-designed vaccines, but also the complex basket of copyrighted and trademarked materials that make those vaccines usable. They argued that residents of richer nations also stood to benefit from the fastest possible containment of the pandemic.But even with the United States\u2019 support for the waiver, unanimity among the WTO\u2019s 164 member nations would be needed to adopt a new policy. And the European Union, led by Germany, immediately voiced objections, echoing the concerns of the brand-name pharmaceutical and biologics industries. Big drugmakers argued that even if the waiver took effect, developing nations with generic drugmakers lack the manufacturing capacity to scale up production of vaccines. The draft text that leaked in March confirmed the worst fears of many advocates that the E.U. and the U.S. had managed to restrict the language of a potential waiver almost to the point of meaninglessness. The leaked language would fail to enable mass reproduction of the brand-name COVID-19 vaccines by generic drugmakers because, among other things, it does nothing to expand access to the \u201cthickets\u201d of additional intellectual property rights needed to make use of patents on individual drugs, according to Lori Wallach, director of the American Economic Liberties Project\u2019s Rethink Trade program. It also would not apply to medications that treat COVID-19 infections, which have become viable in the months since the U.S. announced the waiver, Wallach noted.\u201cThe leaked text represents the lowest common denominator of E.U. fealty to Big Pharma by not actually waiving intellectual property monopolies and the U.S. insistence that only vaccines be covered,\u201d Wallach wrote in a lengthy response to the leak.Wallach nonetheless held out hope that the draft text\u2019s language could improve before the WTO votes whether to adopt it.\u201cThis text is more than disappointing,\u201d Wallach wrote. \u201cBut it also is not the final word.\u201dSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Political Reporter, HuffPostPresident Joe Biden\u2019s drug czar will propose changing state and local laws to allow more people to access the opioid overdose reversal drug naloxone as the country continues to battle a rampaging overdose epidemic that is now claiming more than 100,000 lives every year.Rahul Gupta, the head of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, is expected to make the proposal when he sends the administration\u2019s first national drug control strategy to Congress on Thursday. The administration says the strategy will be the first ever to emphasize harm reduction, marking a shift away from drug control plans with a law enforcement-first approach.\u201cThe most important action we can take to save lives right now is to have naloxone in the hands of everyone who needs it without fear or judgment,\u201d Gupta told reporters on Wednesday.The plan also emphasizes expanding access to addiction treatment programs \u2015 right now, only 1 out of every 10 people who needs treatment gets it \u2015 and on disrupting the finances of criminal organizations that ship illegal drugs into the United States. Harm reduction strategies, including expanding access to naloxone and needle exchange programs, are often controversial. Conservatives argue the programs encourage drug use, although the widespread nature of the opioid epidemic has increased acceptance of the programs. Naloxone, often known by the brand name Narcan, can reverse the effect of an overdose and can be administered intravenously or as a nasal spray. The drug has become a major tool in reducing deaths caused by the opioid epidemic, but the administration says some states and localities still limit its sale. And even in places where the drug is freely available, it does not always make it into the hands of vulnerable populations, including the homeless. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says nearly 107,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in the 12-month period ending in November 2021, the most recent time frame for which data is available. Two-thirds of those deaths involved synthetic opioids, including fentanyl. Drug overdose deaths have doubled over the past six years.The push to make naloxone freely available should attract some Republican support. Earlier this week, a bipartisan group of senators and House members led by West Virginia Sens. Joe Manchin (D) and Shelley Moore Capito (R) wrote letters to seven major manufacturers of the drug, encouraging them to apply to sell it over the counter. \u201cGiven the scale of need at this moment, it has never been more important to adopt opioid overdose prevention and reversal strategies on a wide scale,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cThis includes steps to increase access to affordable naloxone, which is a proven, effective tool to reduce medical emergencies, drug overdoses, and deaths.\u201dSenior Political Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostThe Department of Justice announced Tuesday that it\u2019s prepared to appeal a federal judge\u2019s ruling that had lifted the federal mask mandates on airplanes and other modes of public transportation. The DOJ said in its announcement that it will go forward with the appeal if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention decides the COVID-19 safety mandate is necessary past May 3, which is when it was scheduled to end until a federal judge in Florida ordered it lifted on Monday.\u201cThe Department continues to believe that the order requiring masking in the transportation corridor is a valid exercise of the authority Congress has given CDC to protect the public health,\u201d DOJ spokesperson Anthony Coley said. \u201cThat is an important authority the Department will continue to work to preserve.\u201dThe announcement comes a day after U.S. District Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle, a Donald Trump nominee, ruled that the federal mask mandate exceeded the authority of U.S. health officials, writing in her 59-page decision that they may not \u201cact unlawfully even in pursuit of desirable ends,\u201d such as protecting public health. The Transportation Security Administration, which has been responsible for enforcing the mask rule on modes of public transportation since the early days of the pandemic, announced shortly after Mizelle\u2019s ruling that it would no longer do so but reminded people that the CDC still encouraged masks at indoor transit hubs. By that evening, most major airlines decided they would no longer enforce any mask rules, with some announcing the change to passengers mid-flight. Amtrak, Uber and many airports soon followed suit. Until last week, the CDC was slated to lift the mask mandate that day, but the agency decided to extend it through May 3, citing the need for more time to observe the effects of the BA.2 omicron subvariant currently dominating new cases across the U.S.New cases are on the rise in more than 30 states, but hospitalizations remain fairly low. Mask requirements have been a source of political divide for much of the pandemic, with Democrats largely favoring them as a common-sense public health measure amid the emergence of new COVID-19 variants, and Republicans widely rejecting them as an infringement on personal liberties. However, recent polls have found that it\u2019s more popular to maintain the mask mandate on transit spaces, with 60% of Americans supporting its continuation.

To mark the Monday deadline for filing federal income tax returns, Treasury put out a lengthy statement lamenting the sorry state of the IRS, which the department oversees.\u201cToday\u2019s deadline is an inflection point in what has been the agency\u2019s most challenging filing season in recent history,\u201d Natasha Sarin, Treasury\u2019s counselor for tax policy and implementation, wrote on the agency\u2019s website, blaming \u201cchronic underfunding that has starved the IRS of the tools it needs to serve the American people.\u201dThe IRS is still behind on millions of tax returns from last year, thanks to antiquated technology that forces agency employees to have to open paper returns by hand. And new tax laws have given the agency new responsibilities, such as distributing child tax credit payments to families with minor children. \u201cThe IRS knew walking into this filing season that it did not have the workforce or technology in place to serve the American people the way they deserve \u2015 to pick up the phones when taxpayers call, to help them access all the credits and benefits to which they are entitled, and to ensure that each and every taxpayer receives their refund quickly,\u201d Sarin wrote. But bad customer service doesn\u2019t simply stem from bad bureaucracy \u2015 it results from political choices made by Congress over the years, adding to the IRS workload while starving the agency of additional funding. The IRS budget is 20% lower today than it was in 2010, after adjusting for inflation, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and the agency has 20,000 fewer employees. \u201cToday\u2019s deadline is an inflection point in what has been the agency\u2019s most challenging filing season in recent history.\u201dOf course, tax filing would still be annoying for most people even if the IRS had more staff and better IT. Most Americans are eligible to file their taxes online for free, but hardly any use the \u201cfree file\u201d program. Instead, the IRS has essentially outsourced the tax filing process to private companies like Intuit, which can charge hundreds of dollars even for relatively simple returns. Proposals that would allow the IRS to beef up its free filing options or fill out tax forms automatically never gain steam, even though the agency already has complete wage information for the majority of Americans with regular payroll jobs.Democrats have sought to give the IRS a major funding boost to help the agency close the \u201ctax gap,\u201d the difference between what Americans owe in federal income taxes and what they voluntarily pay. Estimates put the annual gap in the hundreds of billions; Democrats wanted to use the higher revenue to help pay for an ambitious social spending bill, but the legislation has stalled. Republicans, meanwhile, have vilified the IRS for years and have resisted additional funding. They dubiously claimed during Barack Obama\u2019s administration, for instance, that the agency unfairly audited conservative nonprofits. Sen. Mike Crapo (Idaho) \u2015 the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, which oversees tax policy \u2015 said at a hearing last week that the IRS budget is not lower than its historical average (despite the decline since 2010) and that Democratic proposals to boost its budget would ultimately burden taxpayers. \u201cI remain concerned about a huge funding boost that would increase audits on small businesses and middle-class Americans rather than prioritize taxpayer services,\u201d Crapo said.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostFor nearly 20 years, Martha Wright-Reed struggled to pay for phone calls with her incarcerated grandson, Ulandis Forte. He was imprisoned too far away for frequent visits, so phone calls were the main way they could stay in touch. But a few 15-minute phone calls a week cost $200 a month, and Wright-Reed found herself choosing between paying for her medication and speaking with her grandson.Wright-Reed has since passed away, and her grandson is no longer in prison. But a bill bearing her name would bring down the cost of phone calls in prisons and jails, and it could be heading to a vote on the Senate floor.Last month, the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act cleared the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee with bipartisan support, marking the furthest that any legislation of this kind has gotten in the Senate. If signed into law, the bill would restore the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s authority to regulate the cost of all calls incarcerated people make from prisons and jails.Although free or low-cost phone calls are available to most non-incarcerated people who have access to a cellphone and internet, calls in most prisons and jails are prohibitively expensive. As of 2018, the average cost of a 15-minute phone call from jail was $5.74. That\u2019s because a small number of private for-profit companies have near-monopolistic control over the phone industry in detention facilities.\u201cWe need to be clear about how prisons disappear our loved ones and break apart families, especially Black and Brown families,\u201d Forte wrote in a 2019 op-ed. \u201cThis isolation from the very communities that provide love and support to incarcerated individuals does not facilitate rehabilitation; it only creates further pain.\u201dThe high cost of calls disproportionately harms Black people, who are incarcerated in state prisons at nearly five times the rate of white people in the U.S. People who are incarcerated are paid as little as pennies per hour for their labor, putting costly phone calls even further out of reach. In many states, visitation remains on pause because of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving phone calls as the only way to stay in touch with loved ones.\u201cWe know that you lower recidivism when the incarcerated can stay in touch with their family members,\u201d Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), who introduced the bill, told HuffPost. \u201cAnd yet, we make it as difficult as possible for them to stay in touch, because we make phone calls from prisons so incredibly expensive and out of reach for the average family.\u201dThere is a separate bill awaiting movement in the House, sponsored by Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), that would ban detention facilities from receiving commissions from communications providers for calls placed by incarcerated people, and would impose rate caps on those calls.Incarcerated people cannot shop around for the best rates \u2014 they are limited to whichever provider their prison selects. Prison phone contracts are typically not awarded to the provider with the lowest price, but to the one offering to share the highest percentage of its revenue. This practice, known as \u201csite commission contracts,\u201d closely resembles private phone companies paying kickbacks to prison systems to win lucrative contracts.\u201cThe great cost of these calls completely disrupts the economic well-being of those on the outside who are poorly positioned to absorb the enormous costs of talking with their loved ones who are incarcerated,\u201d Rush told HuffPost.In 2000 Wright-Reed became the lead plaintiff in a class action suit against prison phone companies and the Corrections Corporation of America, arguing that the exorbitant cost of calls was unconstitutional. The judge in the case referred the plaintiffs to the FCC. The process with the FCC dragged on for years, with little progress. When Wright-Reed and her co-petitioners asked the FCC to cap the cost of calls, corrections departments argued that they would run out of money.When President Barack Obama entered office, he appointed Mignon Clyburn to the FCC. Clyburn made prison phone justice a priority. In 2013, the FCC voted to cap out-of-state phone calls at 25 cents per minute. At the time, Clyburn credited Wright-Reed with spurring the movement that brought about this change. Two years later, the FCC voted to cap both out-of-state and in-state prison calls at 11 cents a minute, and jail calls at 14 to 22 cents a minute, depending on the size of the facility. FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai, who previously did legal work for the prison telecom giant Securus Technologies, voted against the FCC\u2019s reforms.Before the rate caps could go into effect, several prison phone companies sued the FCC. While the case was still ongoing, President Donald Trump entered office and appointed Pai chairman of the FCC. Pai announced in 2017 that the agency would no longer defend in-state rate caps in court. Months later, an appellate panel ruled in a 2-1 decision to vacate the 2015 rate caps, finding that the FCC didn\u2019t have the authority to regulate in-state calls. The 2013 caps on out-of-state calls remained in place, but in-state calls account for the overwhelming majority of calls from prisons and jails.Rush has introduced bills to address the high cost of phone calls in prisons and jails nine times, starting in 2005, but has not been able to get any signed into law. \u201cThere\u2019s an organized resistance from sheriffs and local county law enforcement groups that reap an enormous profit from their unholy alliance with these phone companies,\u201d Rush said.After the 2017 court ruling, getting a bill passed in Congress that would explicitly authorize the FCC to regulate in-state calls took on new urgency. Duckworth contacted the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association \u2014 a group that previously threatened retaliation against prisoners if the cost of calls were regulated \u2014 and asked them to hear her out.\u201cI went to them, when originally they were absolutely opposed to it, and I just said, \u2018Please just listen to what I have to say, let me come to one of your meetings,\u2019\u201d Duckworth said of the sheriffs group. \u201cWe were in close contact for about three years, working back and forth, refining, writing, rewriting the bill over and over and over again \u2014 until we got to a place where we could both agree on it.\u201dThe Duckworth legislation has one Republican co-sponsor, Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio). Phone justice advocates have welcomed the advancement of Duckworth\u2019s bill, but hope for a vote on Rush\u2019s bill as well.\u201cThis legislation, if it becomes law, will place an important check on the outrageous and predatory rates imposed on families that are already struggling and provide a measure of sanity in a completely broken marketplace,\u201d Cheryl Leanza, policy adviser to the United Church of Christ Media Justice Ministry, said in a statement. \u201cThe compromise amendment restores the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s authority to adopt just and reasonable rates, as it should. We look forward to positive votes in the full Senate and in the House, where Rep. Rush\u2019s bill, H.R. 2489, is ready to move forward.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPostFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) showed support Thursday for two anti-abortion extremists who reportedly stole fetal remains from a Washington, D.C., abortion clinic. Just before signing a 15-week abortion ban into law, the governor applauded the anti-abortion activists who claimed they had approached and taken 115 fetuses from a driver for a waste services business outside the Washington Surgi-Clinic last month.\u201cWe just saw this terrible scandal in Washington, D.C. ... They found all these remains of babies and they found five who were basically infants, premature, they would have been able to survive outside the womb,\u201d DeSantis said at the bill signing at a central Florida church.D.C. police had previously disputed the extremists\u2019 claim \u2015 repeated by DeSantis \u2015 that the fetal remains were the size of \u201cbasically infants.\u201dThe five fetuses in question \u201cwere aborted in accordance with D.C. law, so we are not investigating this incident along those lines,\u201d Ashan Benedict, the executive assistant chief of police, said at a news conference after the remains were discovered. \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be anything criminal in nature right now about that, except for how they got into this house, and so we\u2019ll continue to look at that.\u201dThat didn\u2019t stop DeSantis on Thursday. He continued: \u201cAnd yet, Washington, D.C., is treating that just like we would treat the trash from our lunch or something like that. It\u2019s really horrifying to see that that could go on in our country, but particularly in our nation\u2019s capital. So that is callous, that is wrong. ... What we\u2019re doing today, is saying that we will not let that happen in the state of Florida.\u201dThe Florida governor was met with a loud round of applause from the crowd of anti-abortion supporters. He signed an unconstitutional 15-week abortion ban into law that makes no exceptions for rape or incest. The abortion restriction is set to go into effect on July 1, weeks or even days after the Supreme Court rules in a case that threatens to overturn or gut Roe v. Wade.Lauren Handy and Terrisa Bukovinac, the anti-abortion extremists who were discovered with fetal remains, alleged that a medical waste worker allowed them to seize 115 fetuses from outside the clinic last month. After allegedly burying 110 of the remains in their backyard, Handy and Bukovinac said, they kept the remaining five because they looked \u201cnearly full-term\u201d and wanted to seek out a doctor to confirm the fetuses\u2019 gestational ages.\u201cThe patterns of their wounds suggest violent federal crime,\u201d Handy claimed during a press conference. Both Handy and Bukovinac are part of an organization called Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising.The fetal remains were discovered by D.C. police late last month after receiving a tip. Police told reporters they did not find \u201canything criminal in nature\u201d in regards to the five fetal remains the anti-abortion activists believed to be \u201cnearly full-term.\u201dA day prior to the police finding the remains, the FBI arrested and charged Handy with federal civil rights offenses for a separate incident. Handy and eight others allegedly violated the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act in October 2020 when they purposely blocked the doors of an abortion clinic in Washington, D.C. Handy and the others indicted in the case face up to 11 years in prison and a fine of up to $350,000 each.Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Stephen Miller, who served as a top aide to President Donald Trump, was questioned for hours Thursday by the congressional committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection.Miller was a senior adviser for policy during the Trump administration and a central figure in many of the Republican\u2019s decisions. He had resisted previous efforts by the committee, filing a lawsuit last month seeking to quash a subpoena for his phone records.Miller was interviewed virtually for about eight hours, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private testimony. A second person also confirmed that Miller appeared before the committee. A spokesperson for the committee said the panel had no comment, and Miller did not immediately return a message seeking comment.Miller is the latest in a series of sit-downs the committee has scored with those in Trump\u2019s inner circle as lawmakers move closer to the former president by questioning people who were with him on the day of the attack or were his confidants in the weeks leading up to it.His appearance comes weeks after Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, also agreed to sit down with congressional investigators, months after the committee had first reached out.Members of the panel said Kushner\u2019s testimony in late March, which lasted more than six hours, was helpful. Ivanka Trump, who was with her father in the White House on Jan. 6, was questioned for eight hours last week as congressional investigators tried to piece together her father\u2019s failed effort to delay the certification of the 2020 election results.The nine-member panel subpoenaed the former Trump adviser in November along with Steve Bannon and former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., the panel\u2019s chairman, said at the time that Miller was aware of and had participated in \u201cefforts to spread false information about alleged voter fraud\u201d and had encouraged state legislatures to alter the outcome of the 2020 election by appointing alternate electors.Thompson has also said that Miller helped prepare Trump\u2019s remarks for a rally on the Ellipse that preceded the insurrection and was with Trump when he spoke.The House voted last week to hold former Trump advisers Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino in contempt for their monthlong refusal to comply with subpoenas. The move was the third time the panel has referred people in the former president\u2019s orbit to the Justice Department for potential prosecution for contempt. The first two referrals, sent late last year, were for former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Bannon.The contempt referral against Bannon resulted in an indictment, with a trial set to start in July. The Justice Department has been slower to decide whether to prosecute Meadows, much to the committee\u2019s frustration.By agreeing to cooperate, Miller appears to be looking to avoid the fate of those former advisers and administration officials.For the committee, comprised of seven Democrats and two Republicans, the central facts of the insurrection are known, but what members are hoping to do with the more than 850 interviews and over 100,000 documents is fill in the remaining gaps about the attack on the Capitol. Lawmakers say they are committed to presenting a full accounting to ensure it never happens again.The panel is examining every aspect of the riot, including what Trump was doing while it unfolded and any connections between the White House and the Trump supporters who broke into the Capitol building.Members plan to release information in the coming months as the committee begins to hold public hearings and eventually release a series of reports on the insurrection. While there have been discussions about the possibility of eventually pursuing a criminal referral against Trump, lawmakers have not made a final decision.___Associated Press writer Nomaan Merchant in Washington contributed to this report.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

On Thursday, the FDA announced that it was issuing an emergency use authorization for the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer, which detects coronavirus infections through breath samples. The test can provide results in under three minutes. So far, widely available COVID-19 tests are administered by swabbing inside people\u2019s nostrils with a Q-tip and then testing the sample, with results taking anywhere from a few minutes for a rapid test to days for a PCR test.\u201cToday\u2019s authorization is yet another example of the rapid innovation occurring with diagnostic tests for COVID-19,\u201d Jeff Shuren, director of the FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a release from the agency. He noted that this innovation could help with the current pandemic and \u201cbetter position the U.S. for the next public health emergency.\u201d In a study of over 2,000 people, the test was found to have 91.2% sensitivity (the rate of COVID-positive samples correctly identified) and 99.3% specificity (the rate of negative samples correctly identified). Clinical trials started in 2020, but the device was also tested specifically on the omicron variant, the FDA said.Health care providers can use the test, which is about the size of carry-on luggage, on patients in doctor\u2019s offices, hospitals and mobile testing sites, according to the FDA.As the highly contagious omicron BA.2 subvariant of the coronavirus has been spreading in the U.S., cases nationwide have begun to tick back up.

The eight-episode series, based on Alice Oseman\u2019s Tumblr web-comic-turned-graphic-novel, follows Charlie Spring (Joe Locke), who feels isolated from his classmates at an all-boys school in England because he is gay. He finds himself inexplicably drawn to Nick Nelson (Kit Connor), a star player on the school\u2019s rugby team, after an unexpected run-in.The teens become fast friends and, over time, Charlie joins the rugby team himself, despite having zero interest in the sport. Though his friends presume that the athletic Nick is straight, Charlie himself isn\u2019t so convinced. \u201cHeartstopper\u201d marks Locke\u2019s screen acting debut.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Mentions of Donald Trump have been rare at the first few trials for people charged with storming the U.S. Capitol, but that has changed: The latest Capitol riot defendant to go on trial is blaming his actions on the former president and his false claims about a stolen election.Dustin Byron Thompson, an Ohio man charged with stealing a coat rack from the Capitol, doesn\u2019t deny that he joined the mob on Jan. 6, 2021. But his lawyer vowed Tuesday to show that Trump abused his power to \u201cauthorize\u201d the attack. Describing Trump as a man without scruples or integrity, defense attorney Samuel Shamansky said the former president engaged in a \u201csinister\u201d plot to encourage Thompson and other supporters to \u201cdo his dirty work.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Donald Trump himself spewing the lies and using his position to authorize this assault,\u201d Shamansky told jurors Tuesday during the trial\u2019s opening statements.Justice Department prosecutor Jennifer Rozzoni said Thompson knew he was breaking the law that day.\u201cHe chose to be a part of the mayhem and chaos,\u201d she said.Thompson\u2019s lawyer sought subpoenas to call Trump and former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as witnesses at his trial this week. A judge rejected that request but ruled that jurors can hear recordings of speeches that Trump and Giuliani delivered at a rally before the riot.Thompson\u2019s jury trial is the third among hundreds of Capitol riot prosecutions. The first two ended with jurors convicting both defendants on all counts with which they were charged.In a February court filing, Shamansky said he wanted to argue at trial that Thompson was acting at the direction of Trump and \u201chis various conspirators.\u201d The lawyer asked to subpoena others from Trump\u2019s inner circle, including former White House strategist Steve Bannon, former White House senior adviser Stephen Miller and former Trump lawyers John Eastman and Sidney Powell.Prosecutors said Thompson can\u2019t show that Trump or Giuliani had the authority to \u201cempower\u201d him to break the law. They also noted that video of the rally speeches \u201cperfectly captures\u201d the tone, delivery and context of the statements to the extent they are \u201cmarginally relevant\u201d to proof of Thompson\u2019s intent on Jan. 6.Thompson\u2019s lawyer argued that Trump would testify that he and others \u201d orchestrated a carefully crafted plot to call into question the integrity of the 2020 presidential election.\u201d Shamansky claimed that Giuliani incited rioters by encouraging them to engage in \u201ctrial by combat\u201d and that Trump provoked the mob by saying that \u201cif you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore.\u201dShamansky said Thompson, who lost his job during the COVID-19 pandemic, became an avid consumer of the conspiracy theories and lies about a stolen election.\u201cThis is the garbage that Dustin Thompson is listening to day after day after day,\u201d Shamansky said. \u201cHe goes down this rabbit hole. He listens to this echo chamber. And he acts accordingly.\u201dU.S. District Judge Reggie Walton ruled in March that any in-person testimony by Trump or Giuliani could confuse and mislead jurors.More than 770 people have been charged with federal crimes arising from Jan. 6. Over 250 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors. Thompson is the fifth person to be tried on riot-related charges.On Monday, a jury convicted a former Virginia police officer, Thomas Robertson, of storming the Capitol with another off-duty officer to obstruct Congress from certifying President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 electoral victory. Last month, a jury convicted a Texas man, Guy Reffitt, of storming the Capitol with a holstered handgun.A judge hearing testimony without a jury decided cases against two other Capitol riot defendants at separate bench trials. U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden acquitted one of them of all charges and partially acquitted the other.Thompson has a co-defendant, Robert Lyon, who pleaded guilty to riot-related charges in March.Thompson, then 36, and Lyon, then 27, drove from Columbus, Ohio, to Silver Spring, Maryland, stayed overnight at a hotel and then took an Uber ride into Washington, D.C., on the morning of Jan. 6. After then-President Donald Trump\u2019s speech, Thompson and Lyon headed over to the Capitol.Thompson was wearing a \u201cTrump 2020\u201d winter hat and a bulletproof vest when he entered the Capitol and went to the Senate Parliamentarian\u2019s Office, where he stole two bottles of liquor and a coat rack worth up to $500, according to prosecutors.Thompson and Lyon traded text messages during the riot.\u201cSome girl died already,\u201d Lyon said in one text, an apparent reference to a law enforcement officer\u2019s fatal shooting of a rioter, Ashli Babbitt.\u201cWas it Pelosi?\u201d Thompson replied.\u201cI\u2019m taking our country back,\u201d Thompson later texted Lyon.Around 6 p.m. on Jan. 6, Thompson and Lyon were sitting on a sidewalk and waiting for an Uber driver to pick them up when Capitol police officers approached and warned them that they were in a restricted area. As they started to leave, Thompson picked up a coat rack that appeared to be from the Capitol, the FBI said. Thompson ran away when the officers told him to put down the rack, dropping it as he fled. Lyon stayed behind and identified himself and Thompson to police.That night, Thompson received a text from his wife that said, \u201cI will not post bail.\u201dThe FBI said agents later searched Lyon\u2019s cellphone and found a video that showed a ransacked office and Thompson yelling: \u201cWooooo! \u2019Merica Hey! This is our house!\u201d A surveillance video also captured Thompson leaving a Capitol office with a bottle of bourbon, the FBI said.Thompson is charged with six counts: obstructing Congress\u2019 joint session to certify the Electoral College vote, theft of government property, entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly or disruptive conduct in a Capitol building, and parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building.Lyon pleaded guilty to theft of government property and disorderly conduct. Both counts are misdemeanors punishable by a maximum of 1 year imprisonment. Walton is scheduled to sentence Lyon on June 3.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostQUEENS, N.Y. \u2015 Behind one of the doors here, at an unmarked Brink\u2019s Global warehouse near John F. Kennedy International Airport, is roughly $30 million in gold bars.A group of investment advisers from suburban Pennsylvania parked the gold here last May, shortly after buying it from a seller in Europe. And they chose this spot \u2014 an ordinary-looking warehouse in Springfield Gardens, a majority-Black, lower-middle-class part of town \u2014 for a very specific reason: a provision in the Trump tax cuts that offers breaks to investors who launch ventures in poorer neighborhoods.\u201cWe are actually driving economic activity in economically challenged areas,\u201d Bob Enck, the CEO and founder of the business, boasted in a promotional video. He\u2019s dubbed his scheme the US Opportunity Gold Fund.The gambit relies on \u201copportunity zones,\u201d a controversial federal program that lavishes a steep capital gains cut on rich companies and individuals in exchange for investing in a struggling community. Thanks to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, investors who sell financial assets such as stock can defer and reduce their capital gains taxes \u2014 which can run as high as 40% \u2014 if they use the proceeds to build a business or housing in a federally approved low-income neighborhood.If the venture lasts more than 10 years, the profits from the new business become entirely tax-free.The program entails very few requirements to prove that new projects will benefit existing communities. As a result, opportunity zones have fueled the construction of luxury housing, self-storage units and even a superyacht marina, and helped the Trump tax breaks earn their reputation as a bonanza for the ultrarich.But even in that light, experts told HuffPost the US Gold Opportunity Fund is one of the boldest applications of the program they have ever encountered.\u201cHow on earth is this creating societal value?\u201d said Brett Theodos, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who has criticized the overly broad use of opportunity zones.And they couldn\u2019t be sure whether the fund is ingenious or harebrained.After all, the IRS did lay out a few basic conditions for using opportunity zones: a set of technical rules, and a rule aimed at ventures that meet all the technical rules but conflict in a glaring way with the spirit of the law. The agency even offered examples of ventures that would fail the so-called anti-abuse rule. One scenario consists of turning a vacant lot into a self-pay parking lot while investors wait for the land to go up in value.Another example is a one-person business that warehouses gold while investors wait for the price of gold to increase in value.This poses an obvious challenge for the US Gold Opportunity Fund \u2014 a two-person business that\u2019s warehousing gold while investors wait for the price of gold to increase in value.At least, that is how the fund\u2019s founder is marketing the fund to potential investors. Enck did not respond to multiple calls and emails for this story. But in a series of undated videos on the company\u2019s website, he pitches potential investors on a business model that bears a shocking resemblance to the one the IRS declared improper: sitting on gold for at least 10 years, then selling it tax-free.\u201cWe want to drive economic development in opportunity zones, and within that construct, we are offering a fund that invests in physical gold,\u201d Enck says in one video. \u201cIf anyone has interest in stimulating economic activity in an opportunity zone, and if you like gold as an investment, we should talk.\u201d The ideal investor, he says in another video, is someone who \u201cbuys into the thesis that gold is a good long-term investment.\u201dThe fund raised $30 million from unidentified investors in December 2020, according to a disclosure the group filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Six months later, it contracted with StoneX, a global commodities mover, to buy and deliver $30 million in gold bars from a seller in Europe to the warehouse in Queens. A StoneX executive hailed the delivery as \u201can important part of our broader social responsibility initiatives.\u201d\u201cHow on earth is this creating societal value?\u201dOn hearing a description of the US Gold Opportunity Fund and its airport-adjacent gold stash, Theodos said: \u201cOh, for the love of God.\u201dTo Theodos, this kind of wild scheme exists because the government has lost its ability to meaningfully police wealthy taxpayers, and because Congress required virtually no disclosure when it created the opportunity zone program.\u201cWe need the IRS to be adequately resourced,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to know where opportunity zone projects happen, where they\u2019re located, in real time, so that we can understand and vet what this program is accomplishing. [And] we need a legitimate certification process, which Treasury could undertake right now, to limit the program to mission-minded investors.\u201dOther experts agreed that the fund walks right up to the line of what\u2019s allowed under the IRS rules for opportunity zones \u2015 if it doesn\u2019t simply step over it. \u201cMy first thought was, \u2018Wow, somebody is really setting themselves up and walking right into the anti-abuse example. That\u2019s an interesting choice!\u2019\u201d said Jessica Millett, who specializes in opportunity zone investments at the New York law firm Duval & Stachenfeld. The IRS singled out gold-buying businesses in its regulations because, in the agency\u2019s words, they are \u201cmerely speculative in nature [and] not expected to increase economic activity.\u201d Millett\u2019s guess is that the US Gold Opportunity Fund offers something besides physical gold, such as financial consulting, in order to stay qualified as an opportunity zone business. But the line the fund is walking is extremely fine, Millett said.\u201cThey\u2019re definitely saying, \u2018Hey look, you\u2019re going to own all this gold if you invest in the fund!\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives me pause.\u201dProbably to preempt those criticisms, Enck has claimed that actually, the company\u2019s purchase of gold helps create a flurry of economic activity in disadvantaged neighborhoods.\u201cWe\u2019re really trying to make sure we\u2019re driving economic development,\u201d Enck says in another promotional video. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna move gold back from overseas [and] all the economic activity that [goes] along with that. Storing, securing, guarding, assaying, weighing, all the kind of things that have to happen with gold bars, will be done now, in the United States, in an OZ.\u201dBut the economic impact was difficult to detect on the ground in Springfield Gardens, a tiny neighborhood bounded by some small parks, the Belt Parkway and the razor-wire fencing that surrounds JFK International.From the sidewalk, the Brink\u2019s warehouse where the gold arrived did not look like it had undergone any recent upgrades or expansions. (And why would it, when $30 million in gold bars can fit on a kitchen table?) Approached by a reporter, the driver of an idling Brink\u2019s truck waved her away in annoyance and went back to eating his snack.\u201cWe are actually driving economic activity in economically challenged areas.\u201dMost of the economic impact has likely accrued to whoever gave Enck and his team $30 million. Because there were special tax liability reductions for investors who used the opportunity zone program before 2021, the fund may have already helped customers avoid more than $1 million in federal taxes.At launch, the fund had a grand total of just two employees: Enck and its chief operating officer, Scott Victor. Its website also lists a president, John Pallat, and an affiliated member, Alex Joslin.All four men previously worked at Equinox Funds, an investment manager where Enck was CEO and president from 2007 until 2021. In 2016, the SEC sanctioned Equinox Funds for misrepresenting how it calculated its management fees, among other \u201cmaterial misstatements and omissions,\u201d allowing Equinox to overcharge customers by $5.4 million. Equinox paid a $400,000 fine and refunded more than $5 million to investors, and the fund has since been reorganized under new leadership.For their gold fund venture, Enck and his partners are receiving legal guidance from Dechert, a well-regarded white-shoe law firm, and auditing by Novogradac, an accounting firm of equally good repute. Novogradac did not respond to a request for comment. Dechert did not reply to HuffPost\u2019s inquiries or make the attorneys who advised the Gold OZ Fund available to comment. A few hours after HuffPost first contacted Dechert and Brink\u2019s, the references to disappeared from the \u201cabout us\u201d section of the Gold OZ Fund\u2019s website.The spokesperson for Brink\u2019s did not respond to questions about whether it hires extra personnel or makes physical improvements to its warehouses when it handles a particularly valuable deposit, in this case or in general.So HuffPost asked people around Springfield Gardens whether their new neighbor \u2014 $30 million in gold bricks \u2014 was having a positive impact.\u201cI really can\u2019t say,\u201d said David Mendez, the owner of Bugging Out 4 Burgers, when asked if his restaurant had seen a substantial increase in foot traffic. \u201cMost of our customers are from the community.\u201dSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost"}
{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Justice Department declined a request this week from the House oversight committee to disclose the contents of records that former President Donald Trump took to his Florida residence after leaving the White House, according to a person familiar with the matter.The move could serve as a setback for Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform as it was ramping up its investigation into Trump\u2019s handling of sensitive and even classified information during his time as president and after he left the White House. It remains unclear what implications the decision could have for the panel\u2019s probe, which was announced in March.The Justice Department\u2019s decision is part of an effort to protect confidential information that may compromise an ongoing investigation, according to the person, who was not authorized to discuss the matter by name and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. The development was first reported Tuesday by The Washington Post.The National Archives had referred the matter of Trump\u2019s handling of those records to the Justice Department earlier this year. Because of that, the DOJ is asking the National Archives not to share information related directly to it, including the contents of the 15 boxes that Trump took to his Mar-a-Lago residence.The notice to the committee comes days after its chair, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., accused the Justice Department of \u201cobstructing\u201d the panel\u2019s expanded investigation by preventing the release of information from the National Archives.The Justice Department has not formally announced it is investigating Trump\u2019s handling of the records, but letters between the committee and the department seem to indicate that investigators are taking steps toward it.A spokesperson for the Justice Department declined a request for comment Tuesday.In addition, the FBI has taken steps to begin examining the potential mishandling of classified information related to the documents in the boxes, according to two other people familiar with the investigation who were not authorized to discuss it by name and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. It wasn\u2019t clear exactly what work investigators had done so far or what additional steps they were planning to take.In a letter to the National Archives last month, Maloney made a series of requests for information she said the committee needs to determine if Trump violated federal records laws over his handling of sensitive and even classified information. In response, the general counsel for the archivist wrote on March 28 that \u201cbased on our consultation with the Department of Justice, we are unable to provide any comment.\u201d___Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo and Eric Tucker in Washington contributed to this report.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has a new defense of the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol: It happened only once.On Sunday, the far-right lawmaker tweeted a video of herself ranting at NBC News congressional reporter Scott Wong.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Political Reporter, HuffPostSenior White House Correspondent, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2014 President Joe Biden on Monday nominated former federal prosecutor Steve Dettelbach to head the agency overseeing guns and announced that new rules have taken effect to track so-called \u201cghost guns\u201d \u2014 kits that until now were not required to bear serial numbers.\u201cAll of a sudden it\u2019s no longer a ghost,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt has a return address.\u201dBiden, who has been criticized by gun-control advocates for not doing more to address gun violence in his year in office, invited a California teen who had been shot in the stomach by a ghost gun in a 2019 school shooting while her best friend died of her wounds.\u201cWhen I awoke on Nov. 14, 2019, my biggest worry of the day was a Spanish test,\u201d said Mia Tretta, speaking from the podium in a White House Rose Garden showing off rows of blooming tulips. \u201cWe spent the morning like any other, laughing and talking. Until we heard a loud pop. It was a gunshot, followed by six more.\u201dBiden had on hand a demonstration of a gun kit, walking over to pick up pieces that, within a half hour, can be assembled into a lethal weapon. Until now, guns made from kits like these lacked a serial number that would let police trace its ownership in the event of its use in a crime.\u201cIf you buy a couch you have to assemble, it\u2019s still a couch,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you order a package like this one over here that includes the parts you need and the directions for assembling a functioning firearm, you\u2019ve bought a gun.\u201dBiden detailed his administration\u2019s plan to crack down on the weapons. A new federal rule will require the manufacturers of ghost guns to get licensed, run background checks and include serial numbers on their products.The Justice Department says such privately made guns are expanding in popularity: Law enforcement officials nationally recovered 1,758 in 2016, a number that surged to 19,344 in 2021. Ghost guns were linked to 692 homicide or attempted homicide investigations in that time frame.Biden also urged, as he has many times previously without success, for Congress to renew a long-lapsed prohibition on assault-style weapons, ban high-capacity magazines and end the protection gun makers from lawsuits filed by the families of gun crime. He added that a lawsuit settlement in the case of parents of the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, requires that gun manufacturer Remington to turn over internal papers that could provide critical information about the industry.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until we saw the internal documents that we really understood what cigarette manufacturers were doing to our kids and our families,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we may begin to see what gun manufacturers are and are not doing when it comes to making and marketing their deadly products.\u201dBiden then announced the nomination of Dettelbach, a former U.S. Attorney in Ohio, to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. His first nominee, David Chipman, was withdrawn amid unanimous opposition from Republicans and a lack of support from moderate Democrats. Dettelbach was unanimously confirmed for the U.S. Attorney job in 2009.Biden promised to battle gun violence on the campaign trail, and boasted of his work in the 1990s to pass a ban on assault weapons through Congress. But much of his work to enact stricter gun laws has been stymied by Democrats\u2019 narrow majorities in Congress and the defeat of Chipman, a former ATF agent and gun control advocate.Liberal groups, including Guns Down America and the youth group March For Our Lives, revealed a report card last week handing Biden a D+ for his work on gun control, while praising his work to promote community violence intervention programs.\u201cOne year ago, President Biden stood in the Rose Garden and promised to champion gun violence prevention by issuing executive actions and pushing Congress to pass-life saving legislation,\u201d said Igor Volsky, Executive Director of Guns Down America. \u201cA year later, the President has taken meaningful steps to fund violence intervention programs but has failed to offer or implement a comprehensive vision for reducing all forms of gun violence in America.\u201dPolling shows most Americans negatively view how Biden has handled gun violence issues.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) \u2014 Republican Gov. Larry Hogan\u2019s veto of a measure to expand access to abortion in Maryland was overridden on Saturday by the General Assembly, which is controlled by Democrats.The state will end a restriction that only physicians can provide abortions. The new law will enable nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and physician assistants to provide them with training. It creates an abortion care training program and requires $3.5 million in state funding annually. It also requires most insurance plans to cover abortions without cost.Del. Emily Shetty said she was supporting the measure on the House floor as a mother who had experienced a high-risk pregnancy. She also described being a sexual assault survivor in college and the difficulties she experienced \u201cwith the weight of what had happened after that incident.\u201d\u201cAnd thankfully, the incident did not result in pregnancy but had it, it would have drastically changed my life if I had not been able to access the care that I needed at that time,\u201d Shetty, a Democrat, said.Hogan wrote in his veto letter that the legislation \u201cendangers the health and lives of women by allowing non-physicians to perform abortions.\u201dThe measure comes at a time when the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court is weighing whether to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that banned states from outlawing abortion.If they do, at least 26 states are likely to either ban abortion outright or severely limit access, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization that supports abortion rights.\u201cIn this context, it\u2019s very important that we keep in mind that the strategies that this bill is using is ensuring that people can access the care that they need, when they need it, no matter what happens with the rest of the country \u2014 no matter what happens with the Supreme Court,\u201d said Del. Ariana Kelly, a Democrat who was the lead sponsor of the bill, said.Republican lawmakers criticized the provision allocating $3.5 million of taxpayer money annually to pay for the training. Del. Haven Shoemaker, the House minority whip, described the bill as \u201cthe most radical expansion of abortion in Maryland\u2019s history in a state that already has some of the most liberal abortion laws in the country.\u201d\u201cMadam speaker, this bill is too extreme, even for Maryland,\u201d Shoemaker, a Republican, said, referring to House Speaker Adrienne Jones, a Democrat.Kelly said the measure is modernizing the choice the state\u2019s voters made in 1992, when they approved the right to abortion in a statewide vote with 62% of voters supporting it.\u201cIt is making sure that people have access to care, particularly people of color, particularly low-income people, particularly rural people,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cWe know that physician-only restrictions exacerbate health inequalities, and we are trying to reduce health inequalities in the state of Maryland with this bill.\u201dThe measure takes effect July 1.

But he voted Democratic in the primary, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported last month. He also served as a Democratic state representative in Georgia.Trump in an endorsement video called Jones \u201can America-first fighter, who will never back down to the establishment or the radical left.\u201dJones\u2019 comments on Bannon\u2019s podcast and his tweet drove Twitter critics bonkers.MLK worked closely with Bayard Rustin, an openly gay man, while Coretta Scott King was a gay ally. So I find Vernon Jones\u2019 claims to be false, and also hubristic. How dare he claim to speak for Dr. King? #GOPLiesAboutEverythingI can't choose to be gay, because I am not. Gay people can't choose to be straight for the same reason.So Vernon Jones chose to be straight? Please share with us that momentous event Vernon Jones.I did not realize that civil rights only apply to \"those who come here in ships\".Odds are there were gays on those ships since they exist in every society everywhere throughout all timeWhy does he have to separate human rights into categories?We are all humans and we all deserve EQUAL rightsHere is the trick\u2026 civil rights is a fancy way of saying \u201cfreedom for all, not just freedom for a selected class.\u201dHey Vernon, just 3 weeks ago, a Republican said you should not be allowed to marry anyone who is not black.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPostA bisexual man finds comfort \u2015 and a bit more than he bargained for \u2015 via an online hookup in a quirky and colorful short film. HuffPost caught a sneak peek at \u201cFlex,\u201d debuting online next week as part of the 10th annual Frameline Voices program, hosted by San Francisco\u2019s Frameline Film Festival. Directed by Matt Porter, the film follows Charles (played by actor Charles Gould), a Los Angeles man who is feeling down after an unexpected breakup with his girlfriend (Brianna Baker) before she moves abroad. Before long, Charles finds himself eager to embrace the larger canvas of his sexuality \u2015 which, in his case, includes his interest in men. In the clip below, Charles is introduced to Alex (Charles Rogers), with whom he\u2019s been chatting on a dating app. Whether Charles and Alex find lasting romance remains to be seen, but things are off to an awkward start. Catch a sneak peek at \u201cFlex\u201d below. Gould, whose acting credits include \u201cThe Big Sick\u201d and the Netflix series \u201cBonding,\u201d based the \u201cFlex\u201d screenplay on his own experiences as a bisexual man, having rarely seen himself reflected in pop culture. \u201cThe first time I saw a bisexual man on TV was a vampire on \u2018True Blood,\u2019 which, needless to say, didn\u2019t reflect my experience,\u201d he told HuffPost in an interview. \u201cAs a kid, I was attracted to men and women, and I didn\u2019t really know what to make of that.\u201d\u201cI just thought I was weird because I was turned on by Britney [Spears] and the astronaut in the \u2018Oops!... I Did It Again\u2019 video,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I got older and started having sex that I began to understand that there was such a thing as a bisexual person and that there are a lot of other bi people in the world.\u201d \u201cFlex\u201d is viewable in full here. It will be featured April 14 as one of seven short films included in the Frameline Voices program, presented via a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts. Gould is hopeful that the story of Charles and Alex doesn\u2019t end there, as he and Elliot Page are writing and developing a television series based on the film. \u201c[I\u2019m a] person who\u2019s had their identity questioned their whole life,\u201d he explained. \u201cI would love to explore the bisexuality of Hollywood in the 1930s, \u201940s and \u201950s. I think there is an excellent movie about a bisexual actor today finding his footing and identity as we flash back to a bisexual actor doing the same in the 1940s.\u201d Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "As the conservative right digs its heels into the culture war of the day, the list of books challenged and banned across the country has exploded. According to the American Library Association, 1,597 individual books were targeted in 2021, more than double the number in 2020. The vast majority of the books challenged last year dealt with LGBTQ or racial themes. Right-wing politicians and parents alike have branded themselves free speech warriors who are tired of endless censorship by the liberal media. But the moral panic du jour around critical race theory, and gender and sexuality has driven this select group of people to mount unprecedented attacks on free speech in service of the ongoing culture war.Last year\u2019s anti-book movement came in the form of removals or attempts at removals from libraries, schools and universities across the country.When George Floyd was murdered in May 2020, there was a period when it seemed the country was on the brink of a turning point on racial justice. But the outpouring of support for protesters quickly turned into a backlash.New laws banning teachers from talking about race and racism took hold across GOP-led states, and conservative activists quickly turned their attention to books on the topics.\u201cThe Hate U Give\u201d by Angie Thomas, published in 2017, is about a teenage girl dealing with the fatal police shooting of a friend. Thomas\u2019 book has been targeted by school boards and parents, who say it should be banned because it promotes \u201can anti-police message and indoctrination of a social agenda.\u201dIt made the library association\u2019s top 10 most-challenged books in 2021. Late last year, the book was pulled from a Pennsylvania school after parents complained that the novel appeared on a list assembled by an organization called Social Justice Books.\u201cThe goal of this organization is to compile a list of approved books that educators should use to help promote \u2018social justice\u2019 in the classroom,\u201d one parent said. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t decoded yet \u2026 we\u2019re talking about books that promote and encourage critical race theory.\u201dThe parent had not actually read the whole book, but declared that it was \u201cdisgusting.\u201d A sure sign that these complaints hardly have any merit is a peculiar one that came out of Katy, Texas. Heather E. Schwartz wrote a children\u2019s biography of former first lady Michelle Obama.An unnamed parent in the Katy school district complained that \u201cMichelle Obama: Political Icon\u201d should be pulled from the shelves because it called Donald Trump a bully and implied that \u201cif you sound like a white girl, you should be ashamed of yourself.\u201dThe school district declined to remove the book. But that doesn\u2019t mean Texas isn\u2019t leading the charge in book banning. In October, state Rep. Matt Krause announced that he was investigating 850 books at Texas schools that \u201cmight make students feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress because of their race or sex.\u201d Krause asked schools to report whether they had any such books and how much money they spent on them.Some of the books targeted include nonfiction history books like \u201cAn African American and Latinx History of the United States\u201d by Paul Ortiz, and two novels by Ta-Nehisi Coates. Books on race and racism weren\u2019t the only ones to make Krause\u2019s list. Those that focused on gender, sexuality and the LGBTQ community were present as well, including \u201dAnd Tango Makes Three,\u201d a children\u2019s book about gay penguins and their daughter.Krause most likely included a book about gay penguins because the GOP\u2019s war on LGBTQ people has intensified with Florida\u2019s new \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, and the smearing of transgender people and their allies as sexual predators.Another book that made the 10 most-challenged list is for young people. In Juno Dawson\u2019s \u201cThis Book Is Gay,\u201d the author seeks to teach LGBTQ teens about sexual health \u2014 a sorely missing lesson in our nation\u2019s public education system. In Wyoming, parents complained to a public library about five books included in the sections for teens and children, including Dawson\u2019s. One couple even went to the county sheriff\u2019s office to file a criminal complaint.\u201cWe had thought that they would see a problem with recruiting children for sexual activity when they\u2019re not mature enough for that to be an issue in their lives, creating an issue where it should not be created,\u201d one of the people who went to law enforcement said.A state prosecutor declined to prosecute the librarians.But not facing charges over refusing to ban a book doesn\u2019t mean the fight is over for libraries and schools. This iteration of book bans isn\u2019t really about keeping children safe from Michelle Obama biographies or penguins in a same-sex marriage. The end goal is to eliminate the voices of people of color and the LGBTQ community.It is all a part of the broader war on marginalized communities. Every day, Black people and liberals are accused of practicing critical race theory for speaking about racism, or accused of sexually grooming children for supporting LGBTQ youth.Consider how gay marriage and interracial marriage, two issues already resolved by the Supreme Court, have recently been brought up by prominent Republicans as if those rights weren\u2019t settled. Conservative leaders outwardly accuse liberals and corporations that dare to disagree with their flurry of homophobic and transphobic laws of supporting pedophiles. It\u2019s clear that the culture wars have entered a new and more insidious phase, and that banning books is just the beginning. \nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Actor Kevin Spacey asked a judge Friday to throw out actor Anthony Rapp\u2019s sex abuse lawsuit, saying through his lawyers that allegations that he abused the then-teenage Rapp at a 1980s party are false.The lawyers wrote in papers filed in Manhattan federal court that the alleged events Rapp described never occurred. Rapp has appeared in \u201cRent\u201d on Broadway and in \u201cStar Trek: Discovery\u201d on television.He alleged in his lawsuit that he went to a party in 1986 at Spacey\u2019s Manhattan home, where a 26-year-old Spacey, without Rapp\u2019s consent, \u201cengaged in a sexual advance\u201d by grabbing Rapp\u2019s buttocks and lifting him onto a bed and laying on his body. Rapp claimed he \u201cwas forced to extricate himself\u201d before leaving the party.Spacey\u2019s lawyers argued the alleged encounter cannot qualify as sexual abuse under New York\u2019s laws because the only alleged contact with an \u201cintimate\u201d part of the body by Spacey was when his hand grazed the 14-year-old Rapp\u2019s buttocks when the older actor picked him up. The lawyers said Rapp \u201cwriggled out\u201d with no resistance during an encounter of less than 30 seconds.There was no other evidence that would suggest any fleeting contact between Spacey\u2019s hand and Rapp\u2019s buttocks was for the purpose of sexual gratification or to degrade or abuse Rapp, the lawyers wrote.The lack of evidence means Rapp\u2019s claims for assault, battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress must fail, the lawyers said.They said Spacey \u201cflatly denies\u201d that any of what Rapp described took place.Lawyers for Rapp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.When Rapp first spoke publicly of his claim in 2017, others went public too and Spacey\u2019s then-celebrated career abruptly halted. At the time, Spacey issued a statement saying he didn\u2019t remember the encounter but apologized.Spacey won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in \u201cAmerican Beauty,\u201d a 1999 film in which he played a frustrated suburban father who lusts after his daughter\u2019s best friend.In recent filings, Rapp\u2019s lawyers have asked to transfer the case to state court, saying Spacey cannot prove he has been living in Maryland and qualifies for the diversity of citizenship necessary to remain in federal court.In fact, they argue, he has been mostly living in London since 2003.They said he only lived in Maryland when he was acting in his Emmy-winning role in \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d from 2014 through 2017. He was fired from the show days after Rapp went public and former show workers claimed that Spacey made the production a \u201ctoxic\u201d workplace and one ex-employee alleged the actor sexually assaulted him.In November, an arbitrator said Spacey and his production companies must pay the studio behind the Netflix political thriller $31 million because of losses they incurred after his firing.Spacey appealed the decision to a panel of three more private arbitrators, who found for the plaintiffs, making the decision final, and public.A criminal case brought against him, an indecent assault and battery charge stemming from the alleged groping of an 18-year-old man at a Nantucket resort, was dismissed by Massachusetts prosecutors in 2019.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostForget about Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s wedding? Never. And it\u2019s obvious that the royal couple\u2019s friend and wedding DJ \u2015 actor Idris Elba \u2015 hasn\u2019t either, as he continues to share tidbits from the May 19, 2018, big day. The \u201cLuther\u201d actor appeared on BBC\u2019s \u201c1Xtra Rap Show\u201d last weekend and spoke with host Tiffany Calver about his role as DJ at the couple\u2019s wedding reception. \u201cBy the way, what is the vibe of a Harry and Meghan wedding?\u201d Calver asked. \u201cWhat tune was the one that got everyone going crazy?\u201d \u201cI Wanna Dance With Somebody,\u201d Elba said, referring to the Whitney Houston classic. \u201cThey went off on that tune.\u201d Elba said that another song that stirred the crowd was \u201cStill D.R.E.\u201d\u201cWhat \u2015 WHAT?

He\u2019s also spoken about the pressure that came with the royal DJ gig, and admitted he first thought it was a joke when Prince Harry asked him to perform. \u201cI met Harry and William a few times, and Harry came to a couple of parties that I DJed,\u201d Elba told Ellen DeGeneres back in 2019. And then one day, Harry \u201cwas like, \u2018Hey man, what are you doing on\u2019\u201d May 19?\u201cI was like, \u2018Nothing.\u2019 He goes, \u2018Hmm. Would you DJ at my wedding?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Is this a joke? Are you joking?\u2019\u201d Elba said. \u201cAnd then he\u2019s like ... serious.\u201dOf course, it turned out to be one of Elba\u2019s most stressful gigs ever, in addition to a career high. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t like my cousin\u2019s wedding,\u201d the actor said during an appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d last year. \u201cThis was like, you know, this wasn\u2019t at the community hall, the reception.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) ordered the state to start busing undocumented immigrants to Washington, D.C., on Wednesday in response to President Joe Biden\u2019s lifting of a policy that turned away migrants because of the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cTexans cannot continue to shoulder the burdens imposed by open-border advocates in other parts of the country,\u201d Abbott said in his order to the Texas Division of Emergency Management, or TDEM.Migrants in Texas \u2015 many of whom are seeking asylum in the U.S. after fleeing government corruption, violence and crime in their home countries \u2015 will be given \u201cvoluntary transportation\u201d to Washington and other undisclosed locations, the governor said in his directive. It\u2019s unclear what other choices they\u2019ll have.\u201cWe are sending them to the United States\u2019 capital, where the Biden administration will be able to more immediately address the needs of the people that they are allowing to come across our border,\u201d Abbott said at a press conference Wednesday in the border city of Weslaco.The order is among several legally dubious actions Abbott announced Wednesday to target illegal border crossings. Others include directing the state\u2019s Department of Public Safety to start stopping and inspecting commercial vehicles coming across the U.S-Mexico border \u2015 though that\u2019s sure to slow traffic between Texas and its biggest trading partner \u2015 as well as increasing military activity in South Texas and installing razor wire in more easily crossed parts of the Rio Grande.TDEM estimates the plan will require 900 charter buses to take immigrants on the approximately 30-hour bus journey to D.C. Abbott did not elaborate in his directive or his press conference on how the program will be managed or funded, and opponents quickly decried what they characterized as attention-getting antics by someone angling to run for president in 2024.\u201cIf Abbott focused on solutions instead of stunts, then Texas could have made some real progress on this issue over the last seven years,\u201d Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke said in a statement. O\u2019Rourke, a former U.S. House member, is seeking to unseat Abbott in the Texas gubernatorial race later this year. RAICES, a Texas-based organization that helps immigrants and refugees, called Abbott\u2019s actions \u201cdisgusting.\u201dWe see what you are doing here, and it's disgusting.@GregAbbott_TX  is trying to Make Texas White Again. https://t.co/4AduW1FBQFThe governor\u2019s war on immigrants is sure to face court challenges from opponents who say he\u2019s overstepping the federal government\u2019s authority on immigration matters. The architects of Abbot\u2019s plan say states have the constitutional right to defend themselves from an \u201cinvasion,\u201d but experts say that defense is shaky. \u201cJust because the state says that it is an invasion that doesn\u2019t necessarily make it so, it is not clear to me what additional legal authority that conveys on them,\u201d Emily Berman, an instructor on constitutional law at the University of Houston, told The Associated Press following Abbott\u2019s announcement. Recent media investigations into Abbott\u2019s \u201cOperation Lone Star,\u201d the moniker he\u2019s given to his administration\u2019s ongoing crackdown on immigration, have found that it\u2019s both rife with corruption and ineffective at slowing border crossings into Texas. Abbott\u2019s latest orders follow Biden\u2019s announcement that he\u2019s lifting a public health measure next month called Title 42. Under the Trump-era policy, the U.S. asserted the authority to block migrants from entering the country due to the risk of COVID-19 contagion. The policy has been used to turn away asylum-seekers more than 1.7 million times in the past two years, but will now expire on May 23.The Department of Homeland Security said it\u2019s preparing for around 18,000 migrant arrivals a day once Title 42 is lifted, up significantly from this week\u2019s average of 7,100 arrivals.Democrats have been divided on the decision to ditch the policy, with progressives championing it as long overdue and moderates saying the country wouldn\u2019t be able to manage the sudden influx. \u201cTitle 42 was a cruel and discriminatory policy that circumvented U.S. law, preventing people from accessing protections established by Congress,\u201d Congressional Progressive Caucus Chair Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) said in a statement following the decision.The two Democratic senators from Arizona, which also shares a border with Mexico, said they opposed the move. Sen. Mark Kelly said it\u2019s \u201cunacceptable to end Title 42 without a plan and coordination in place to ensure a secure, orderly, and humane process at the border.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Sure enough, I was hacking so hard that my stitches burst. I went into my first surgery after the C-section to get restitched.\u201dLittle did Williams realize that this would be the first of her many surgeries in the hospital.\u201cI wasn\u2019t coughing for nothing; I was coughing because I had an embolism, a clot in one of my arteries.\u201d She added that her medical record showed that her doctors also discovered a hematoma \u2014 a collection of blood outside the blood vessels.Yet medical workers wouldn\u2019t have caught these conditions if Williams hadn\u2019t had prior knowledge of blood clot symptoms (she\u2019d experienced them previously) along with the will to advocate for herself so they would take her concerns seriously.But they didn\u2019t at first.Williams notes in her essay that after she was restitched, she woke up and still \u201cfelt like I was dying.\u201d She mustered the strength to get out of her bed and find some help. But when she found a nurse and suggested she get a CAT scan and be put on blood thinners, the nurse ignored her, she said.\u201cI told her: \u2018I need to have a CAT scan of my lungs bilaterally, and then I need to be on my heparin drip.\u2019 She said, \u2018I think all this medicine is making you talk crazy,\u2019\u201d the tennis star recalled.Williams persisted, and after several attempts to get the nurse to listen, she said, they finally called the doctor in. \u201cI fought hard, and I ended up getting the CAT scan. I\u2019m so grateful to her. Lo and behold, I had a blood clot in my lungs, and they needed to insert a filter into my veins to break up the clot before it reached my heart,\u201d she wrote.The experience had quite an impact on Williams. In 2018, when she first spoke about her pulmonary embolism with the BBC, she emphasized how fortunate she was.\u201cI had a wonderful, wonderful doctor. Unfortunately a lot of African-Americans and black people don\u2019t have the same experience that I\u2019ve had,\u201d she told the BBC. She added:\u201cBecause of what I went through, it would be really difficult if I didn\u2019t have the health care that I have \u2015 and to imagine all the other women that do go through that without the same health care, without the same response, it\u2019s upsetting.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "SAN ANTONIO (AP) \u2014 Former Trump administration officials are pressing Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to declare an \u201cinvasion\u201d along the U.S.-Mexico border and give thousands of state troopers and National Guard members sweeping new authority to turn back migrants, essentially bestowing enforcement powers that have been a federal responsibility.The urging comes as the Republican governor prepares to announce Wednesday \u201cunprecedented actions\u201d to deter migrants coming to Texas after the Biden administration announced last week it will end the use of a public health law that has limited asylum to prevent the spread of COVID-19.It is unclear whether Abbott, who is up for reelection in November and is already installing more border barrier and allowing troopers to arrest migrants on trespassing charges, supports the aggressive proposals former Trump officials are pushing. Abbott did not elaborate on what steps he will announce Wednesday.Border Patrol officials say they are planning for as many as 18,000 arrivals daily once the health policy, known as the Title 42 authority, expires in May. Last week, about 7,100 migrants were coming a day to the southern U.S. border.But the way former Trump immigration officials see it, Texas and Arizona can pick up where the federal government leaves off once the policy ends. Their plan involves a novel interpretation of the U.S. Constitution to have the National Guard or state police forcibly send migrants to Mexico, without regard to immigration laws and law enforcement procedures. Border enforcement has always been a federal responsibility, and in Texas, state leaders have not been pushing for such a move.Tom Homan, the former acting director for Immigration and Customs Enforcement under Trump, said at a border security conference in San Antonio last week he had spoken with Abbott but gave no indication about whether the two-term governor supported the idea.\u201cWe\u2019ve had discussions with his attorneys in his office, \u2018Is there a way to use this clause within the Constitution where it talks about invasion?\u2019\u201d Homan said during the Border Security Expo.Homan on Tuesday described the response from Abbott\u2019s office, which he said took place about three months ago, as \u201cnon-committal but willing to listen.\u201dIn Arizona, Republican Gov. Doug Ducey has also been under pressure within his party to declare that the state is being invaded and use extraordinary powers normally reserved for war. But Ducey, who is term-limited and not on the ballot in 2022, has not embraced the theory and has avoided commenting directly on it.Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, issued a legal opinion in February declaring that Ducey has the power to use National Guard troops and state law enforcement to forcibly send migrants back. Brnovich is locked in a tough Republican U.S. Senate primary in which border security is a top issue.Driving the effort on the right is the Center for Renewing America, a conservative policy think tank led by former Trump administration officials. It includes Ken Cuccinelli, an immigration hard-liner and former Homeland Security official under Trump. He argued that states are entitled to defend themselves from immediate danger or invasion, as it is defined by the \u201cinvasion clause,\u201d under the \u201cstates self-defense clause.\u201dWhile speaking Tuesday to a conservative talk radio station, Abbott\u2019s remarks about constitutional authority were in relation to Congress, which he said had the only power to reduce the flow of migrants.\u201cWe\u2019ll be taking unprecedented action,\u201d Abbott told radio station KCRS. \u201cCongress has to stop talking about it, has to stop complaining about it, has to stop going to the border and looking at it. Congress has to take action, just like Texas is taking action.\u201dAsked if he considered what was happening on the Texas border \u201can invasion,\u201d Abbott did not use those words but said he would be discussing it Wednesday.Cuccinelli said in practice, he envisions the plan would look similar to the enforcement of Title 42, which circumvented U.S. obligations under American law and international treaty to provide asylum. He said he has not spoken with Abbott and said the governor\u2019s current sweeping border mission, known as Operation Lone Star, has put little dent in the number of people crossing the border. The mission has also drawn criticism from Guard members over long deployments and little to do, and some arrests have appeared to have no connection to border security.\u201cUntil you are actually returning people to Mexico, what you are doing will have no effect,\u201d Cuccinelli said.Emily Berman, who teaches constitutional law at the University of Houston, said the \u201cinvasion clause\u201d cited by proponents is tucked into a broader constitutional assurance that the U.S. must defend states from invasion and domestic violence. Additionally, she said, the \u201cstate self-defense clause\u201d says states cannot engage in warlike actions or foreign policy unless invaded.Berman said she hasn\u2019t seen the constitutional clauses used since the 1990s, when the courts ruled that they did not have jurisdiction to decide what qualified an invasion, but believed that one could only be done by another governmental entity.For example, Berman said, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia can be qualified as one because it is an outside government breaching another country\u2019s boundaries with the use of military force.\u201cJust because the state says that it is an invasion that doesn\u2019t necessarily make it so, it is not clear to me what additional legal authority that conveys on them,\u201d Berman said, adding that state officials can enforce state laws, but the line is drawn at what the federal law allows.U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat whose district includes the Texas border, has criticized the Biden administration over border security and ending Title 42. But he does not support states trying to use new powers that would let them \u201cdo whatever they want.\u201d\u201cI think it should be more of a partnership instead of saying, \u2018Federal government, we don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing enough, and why don\u2019t we go ahead and do our own border security?\u2019\u201d he said.___Associated Press reporter Jonathan J.

The emails from attorney John Eastman date from between Jan. 4 and Jan. 7, 2021, the days abutting the deadly insurrection.Eastman had attempted to shield the missives from lawmakers, claiming they were protected under attorney-client privilege.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2014 Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) does not seem bothered by far-right figures saying his colleagues support pedophilia because they support Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s Supreme Court nomination. \u201cI don\u2019t feel any responsibility for the words of other people,\u201d Hawley told HuffPost on Tuesday. Hawley was the first to criticize Jackson by calling her soft on child pornography offenders last month. He argued that she wrongfully handed out light sentences to people who possessed child sexual abuse images, even though her record in those cases was typical for a federal district judge.Hawley\u2019s criticism resonated with far-right conspiracy theorists who believe Democrats are involved in child sex trafficking rings, and on Monday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) declared that any senator who supports Jackson\u2019s nomination is actually \u201cpro-pedophile.\u201d\u201cYou are either a Senator that supports child rapists, child pornography, and the most vile child predators,\u201d Greene said in a Twitter thread. \u201cOr you are a Senator who protects children and votes NO to KJB!\u201dFifty-three senators, including Republicans Mitt Romney (Utah), Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) voted Monday for a procedural motion to advance Jackson\u2019s nomination. All are now \u201cpro-pedophile,\u201d according to Greene, who likes to boast that she represents the base of the Republican Party rather than its fringe. As with the issue of supposed fraud in the 2020 election, Hawley does not use the same language as the more zealous members of his party \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t like to contradict them, either. When asked what he thought of calling a vote for Jackson \u201cpro-pedophile,\u201d Hawley didn\u2019t directly disagree. But he did volunteer that \u201cpro-pedophile\u201d is not an accurate description of Jackson. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Judge Jackson is pro-pedophile. I think she has a judicial philosophy where she thinks these crimes \u2026 are over-sentenced, over-criminalized,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s in favor of this activity, but I think she\u2019s got a philosophy that leads her to treat these criminals leniently.\u201d In arguing that Jackson was soft on offenders in child pornography cases, Hawley has relied on the fact that her prison sentences were shorter than federal guidelines, but mostly ignored another fact: that most district judges sentence beneath the guidelines as well. Fifty-nine percent of cases involving possession of child sexual abuse imagery in 2019 resulted in sentences less severe than the guidelines recommended, according to a report published last year by the U.S. Sentencing Commission. The reason for the lower sentences in cases involving child sexual abuse images, according to the commission, is that the more widespread use of computers has made the guidelines obsolete. Their original intent was to differentiate the severity of offenses at a time when it was more difficult to obtain vast numbers of illicit images. Hawley told HuffPost he believed Jackson\u2019s sentences in child pornography cases were actually more lenient than those of her peers on the bench. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said Monday that her sentences were 33% shorter than the national average from 2015 to 2019 in all criminal cases. \u201cJudge Jackson\u2019s sentences were appropriate exercises of discretion as a judge applying the law to the facts in difficult cases,\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said in a floor speech Tuesday. \u201cAnd it\u2019s interesting to me how the senator from Missouri has carefully drawn lines to exclude Trump appointees to the bench who\u2019ve done exactly what this judge has done as well.\u201d The idea that Democrats support pedophiles has been a mainstay of far-right conspiracy theories for years. In 2016, a North Carolina man traveled to Washington, D.C., and fired an assault rifle inside a pizza restaurant as part of his effort to investigate a supposed Democratic-run child sex trafficking ring operating out of the basement. The so-called Pizzagate story was a predecessor to the QAnon movement, whose adherents helped storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Hawley said he was not familiar with Pizzagate or QAnon, even though it was Jackson herself who sentenced the Pizzagate shooter to four years in prison in 2017.

He previously had his bail increased when he hit the stage at the Rolling Loud music festival in July 2021, where she also performed.During the festival, the Houston rapper\u2019s team insisted Lanez was less than the court-ordered 100 yards away from her. As a result, his bail was increased from $190,000 to $250,000 in August.Megan previously spoke out about the sexism and indifference she faced after being assaulted.\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of criticism.

This year, Upton was drawn into a new congressional district with another GOP incumbent, Rep. Bill Huizenga, who is backed by Trump \u2014 sharply increasing his chances of losing a GOP primary. Trump said this month that Huizenga has his \u201ccomplete and total endorsement\u201d in Michigan\u2019s new 4th Congressional District.Upton was one of 10 House Republicans who voted with Democrats in 2021 to impeach Trump for instigating the Capitol riot, and he joins three of them \u2014 Reps.

Each of these Republicans faced either primary challengers or redrawn districts that were less favorable to their reelection prospects.\u201cThe Congress must hold President Trump to account and send a clear message that our country cannot and will not tolerate any effort by any President to impede the peaceful transfer of power from one President to the next. Thus, I will vote to impeach,\u201d Upton said in a January 2021 statement discussing his vote.Upton was first elected in 1986 and is a member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.Following his impeachment vote, Upton received death threats and faced censure from local GOP groups in his southwest Michigan district.But Upton left it open as to whether he would run again.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostThe 2022 Grammys were already set to be a history-making night, but a surprise appearance from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sealed the deal. Midway through the telecast of the 64th annual awards ceremony on Sunday night in Las Vegas, the embattled leader offered a plea to all those watching around the world amid Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion of his nation.In a pre-taped video from a Kyiv bunker, Zelenskyy delivered a powerful speech reportedly filmed within 48 hours of the broadcast, according to Variety, as part of a special tribute to Ukraine.Drawing striking connections between war and the power of music, Zelenskyy asked, \u201cThe war. What is more opposite of music?\u201d before relaying the tragic impact of the invasion.\u201cThe silence of ruined cities and killed people,\u201d he said. \u201cOur children draw swooping rockets, not shooting stars. Over 400 children have been injured and 153 children died, and we will never see them drawing. Our parents are happy to wake up in the morning in bomb shelters but alive. Our loved ones don\u2019t know if we will be together again. The war doesn\u2019t let us choose who survives and who stays in eternal silence.\u201d\u201cOur musicians wear body armor instead of tuxedos. They sing to the wounded in hospitals. Even to those who can\u2019t hear them,\u201d Zelenskyy continued. \u201cBut the music will break through anyway. We defend our freedom. To live. To love. To sound. On our land, we are fighting Russia, which brings horrible silence with its bombs.\u201dpic.twitter.com/kJpRBMh0U3He concluded his remarks with a call to the celebrity-packed event at the MGM Grand Garden Arena: \u201cFill the silence with your music. Fill it today. Tell our story. Tell the truth about the war on your social networks and TV. Support us in any way you can, but not silence. And then peace will come.\u201d Zelenskyy went on to say he holds a dream for the cities that have been hardest hit by the war, including Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Volnovakha and Mariupol.\u201cI have a dream of them living,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd free. Free like you on the Grammy stage.\u201dThe video introduced a performance of John Legend\u2019s new song, \u201cFree,\u201d which featured a poem read by Ukrainian refugee Lyuba Yakimchuk and accompaniment by Ukrainian musicians Siuzanna Iglidan and Mika Newton.The stirring performance ended by directing viewers to a donation page to support the war-torn region\u2019s refugees. Prior to the Grammys telecast, rumors swirled earlier this month about whether Zelenskyy would appear at the Academy Awards with both co-host Amy Schumer and one of Hollywood\u2019s most vocal Ukraine supporters, Sean Penn, supporting the idea. But much to Penn\u2019s dismay \u2015 the actor threatened to \u201csmelt\u201d his Oscars in public if the academy chose not to let Zelenskyy speak \u2015 the Ukrainian president did not appear during the ceremony.Instead, the Oscars featured a 30-second moment of silence, which ended with a plea to those tuning in to the awards show: \u201cWe ask you to support Ukraine in any way you are able. #StandWithUkraine.\u201dWatch Legend\u2019s performance below.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Environment Reporter, HuffPostFor the world to have any chance of preventing catastrophic climate change, it needs an immediate, collective and herculean effort to phase out fossil fuels and rein in greenhouse gas emissions. And even if humanity pulls it off, planetary warming is likely to at least temporarily soar past 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the aspirational goal of the landmark Paris climate accords. That is the conclusion of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s latest report, published Monday, focusing on what is required to tackle a threat that is already causing suffering and devastation around the globe. Although there are signs of climate action, the world remains wildly short of meeting international goals.\u201cIt\u2019s now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C,\u201d Jim Skea, who co-chairs the panel that authored the report, said in a statement. \u201cWithout immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.\u201d To achieve the 1.5-degree target, global greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025 and then be cut approximately 43% below 2019 levels by the end of the decade, and 84% by 2050, the IPCC said.That is a monumental task. Human greenhouse gas emissions were 12% higher in 2019 than in 2010, and policies implemented at the end of 2020 have put the planet on course to a devastating 3.2 degrees of warming. Existing and soon-to-be-built fossil fuel infrastructure are forecast to spew enough pollution into the atmosphere in the coming years to put the 1.5-degree target out of reach. \u201cIncreased action must begin this year, not next year; this month, not next month; and indeed today, not tomorrow,\u201d Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. environment program, said at a news conference announcing the findings. \u201cOtherwise we will ... continue to sleepwalk into a climate catastrophe.\u201dAs the report highlights, the solution is clear: The world, in particular wealthy nations that are responsible for the vast majority of emissions, must stop investing in dirty energy and move quickly to replace coal, oil and gas with renewables, like solar and wind. Political forces continue to be the biggest obstacles to aggressive action. \u201cThe interaction between politics, economics and power relationships is central to explaining why broad commitments do not always translate to urgent action,\u201d reads a technical document accompanying the report. The sobering assessment comes as Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine threatens to further delay efforts to confront climate change in the U.S. and abroad. The Biden administration has set ambitious climate goals, but is now facing pressure to boost domestic oil and gas production in order to combat rising energy costs and assist European allies as they scramble to reduce their reliance on Russian petroleum.Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, recently warned that the conflict in Eastern Europe could be the death knell for limiting planetary warming to 1.5 degrees. And at Monday\u2019s news conference, he said the report is \u201ca litany of broken promises\u201d and \u201ca file of shame.\u201d \u201cClimate activists are sometimes depicted as dangerous radicals,\u201d Guterres said. \u201cBut the truly dangerous radicals are the countries that are increasing the production of fossil fuels. Investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure is moral and economic madness.\u201dMonday\u2019s report, authored by 278 experts from 65 countries, is the third installment of the IPCC\u2019s sixth global assessment. The second report, published in February, analyzed climate impacts and vulnerabilities, and warned that \u201cthe extent and magnitude of climate change impacts are larger\u201d than previously known. The window to \u201csecure a livable and sustainable future for all\u201d is rapidly closing, that document said. Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance & Sustainable Development and a peer-reviewer of the new report, said the world is facing a \u201cdo-or-die moment.\u201d\u201cIf the last report from the Sixth Assessment was an atlas of human suffering and failed leadership, this report is an atlas of human hope and the last chance for the leadership we need from the heads of State to return to a safe climate,\u201d Zaelke said in a statement. John Kerry, the Biden administration\u2019s special climate envoy, said the report \u201crepresents a defining moment for our planet.\u201d \u201cEvery country must move further and faster,\u201d Kerry said in a statement. \u201cFaster means rapidly upscaling deployment of renewable energy. Faster means targeting methane emissions. Faster means reducing demand and focusing on efficiency. Faster means halting and reversing global deforestation. Faster means demanding more sustainable transit.\u201d\u201cChoosing the more sustainable option is not only the right thing to do, but the IPCC has shown it is now the more affordable choice,\u201d Kerry added.Environment Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a lawsuit Friday challenging a state law that a group of voters is using to challenge her eligibility to run for reelection.The challenge filed last month with the Georgia secretary of state\u2019s office alleges that Greene, a Republican, helped facilitate the Jan. 6, 2021, riot that disrupted Congress from certifying Joe Biden\u2019s presidential election victory. That violates a provision of the 14th Amendment and makes her ineligible to run for reelection, the challenge says.Greene\u2019s lawsuit asks a judge to declare that the law that the voters are using to challenge her eligibility is itself unconstitutional and to prohibit state officials from enforcing it.A rarely cited part of the 14th Amendment says no one can serve in Congress \u201cwho, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress . . . to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same.\u201d Ratified shortly after the Civil War, it was meant in part to keep representatives who had fought for the Confederacy from returning to Congress.Georgia law says any voter who is eligible to vote for a candidate may challenge that candidate\u2019s qualifications by filing a written complaint within two weeks after the deadline for qualifying. The secretary of state must then notify the candidate of the challenge and request a hearing before an administrative law judge. After holding a hearing, the administrative law judge presents findings to the secretary of state, who then must determine whether the candidate is qualified.Free Speech for People, a national election and campaign finance reform group, filed the challenge March 24 on behalf of the group of voters. A hearing before an administrative law judge has been set for April 13.Greene \u201cvigorously denies that she \u2018aided and engaged in insurrection to obstruct the peaceful transfer of presidential power,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit says.The law only requires the people challenging a candidate\u2019s eligibility to file a written statement of why they believe the candidate isn\u2019t qualified, and that automatically triggers the secretary of state\u2019s request for a hearing before an administrative law judge, the lawsuit says. The fact that a government investigation can be triggered based only on the challenger\u2019s belief violates Greene\u2019s First Amendment right to run for political office, the lawsuit says.The challenge statute also puts the burden on Greene to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that she didn\u2019t engage in the alleged behavior, and that \u201cburden shifting\u201d violates the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, the lawsuit says.The lawsuit also alleges that the challenge statute \u201cdirectly usurps\u201d Congress\u2019 constitutional ability to judge whether a member is qualified.Finally, a law passed in 1872 removed the disqualifications put in place by the part of the 14th Amendment that the challengers are trying to use against Greene, lawsuit saysVoters supported by Free Speech for People filed a similar challenge against U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn in North Carolina that has been blocked by a federal judge.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "General Assignment Reporter, HuffPostNBA icon Kareem Abdul-Jabbar slammed Will Smith for his attack on Chris Rock during the Oscars, writing that the \u201cKing Richard\u201d star \u201cadvocated violence, diminished women ... and perpetuated stereotypes about the Black community.\u201dIn a Substack essay posted Monday, the all-time scoring leader broke down the many ways Smith inflicted harm by slapping Rock for a joke about wife Jada Pinkett Smith\u2019s shaved head.\u201cBy hitting Rock, he announced that his wife was incapable of defending herself\u2014against words,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar wrote.\u201cThis patronizing, paternal attitude infantilizes women and reduces them to helpless damsels needing a Big Strong Man to defend their honor least they swoon from the vapors,\u201d he explained.The six-time NBA champion, who appeared with Smith on \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\u201d in 1994, said Smith\u2019s \u201cself-serving\u201d acceptance speech for his best-actor Oscar, in which he spoke of protecting women in his movie \u201cKing Richard,\u201d was about \u201cjustifying his violence.\u201d\u201cApparently, so many people need Smith\u2019s protection that occasionally it gets too much and someone needs to be smacked,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar sniped.The writer wrote that the Black community also felt Smith\u2019s blow.\u201cOne of the main talking points from those supporting the systemic racism in America is characterizing Blacks as more prone to violence and less able to control their emotions,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar wrote. \u201cSmith just gave comfort to the enemy by providing them with the perfect optics they were dreaming of.\u201dThe shocking incident unfolded when Rock was presenting the best documentary award. He cracked to Pinkett Smith that he looked forward to seeing her in \u201cG.I. Jane 2.\u201d The real \u201cG.I. Jane\u201d starred Demi Moore, who shaved her head for the 1997 role. But Will Smith took the zinger personally because his wife has been suffering from hair-loss causing alopecia. He walked up to the stage and struck Rock across the face, then yelled at him, \u201cKeep my wife\u2019s name out your fucking mouth!\u201dSubstack noted that Smith had apologized to Rock and called his own actions \u201cunacceptable\u201d since the essay was published.Celebrity takes on the incident have ranged from actor Tiffany Haddish praising Smith for standing up for his spouse to comedian Jim Carrey saying he was \u201csickened\u201d by \u201cspineless\u201d Hollywood after the crowd gave Smith a standing ovation for winning the Best Actor award.General Assignment Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Front Page Editor, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2015 One of the most memorable moments of Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearings came at the end of her two days of grueling questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee.Democratic senators had been on her side the whole time, but the remarks from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) were different. He delivered an impassioned speech about her historic nomination to become the first Black woman on the high court and called out the disrespectful and inaccurate lines of questioning from Republican senators.The speech moved Jackson to tears, momentarily giving viewers a small glimpse of the pressure and emotions she had been so masterfully keeping inside that week. And it turned the focus from all the attacks on her to the joy felt by many about her nomination.\u201cNobody is gonna steal the joy,\u201d Booker said. \u201cYou have earned this spot. You are worthy. You are a great American. \u2026 You\u2019re here. And I know what it\u2019s taken for you to sit in that seat.\u201dSpeaking at a roundtable of Democratic senators Wednesday, Booker expanded on that moment, explaining that his \u201cdifferent lived experience\u201d put him in a position to speak to the frustrations many were feeling during last week\u2019s hearings.\u201cClearly, I have a different lived experience than a lot of my colleagues and was able to speak to the heart of what a lot of folks who were feeling that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful that Sen. [Chuck] Schumer, Sen. [Dick] Durbin put me in a position to be in that moment. But make no mistake, we are an amazing team on the Judiciary Committee.\u201dWhen Booker won his special election in 2013, he became just the ninth Black person to ever serve in the Senate.Durbin, the committee\u2019s chair, told reporters that the attacks were \u201cdisgusting.\u201d\u201cI cannot believe the visceral reaction by some Republicans on that committee to assertive women of color. They just can\u2019t handle it. And if you watch what they do to these women, it\u2019s disgusting,\u201d he said.It\u2019s not the first time Durbin has voiced concern about how women of color who appear before the committee have been treated.Responding to criticism that Democrats aside from Booker did not defend Jackson enough, Durbin replied, \u201cThe strongest advocate for Judge Jackson was Judge Jackson. That woman showed such extraordinary strength, and it came as no surprise.\u201d\u201cThere was a moment when the committee hearing was getting away from us,\u201d Durbin added, referring to his exchange with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas).\u201cI spoke up to stop him from badgering the judge with some of the baseless charges he was making and continues to this day. But she really is extraordinary, and she won support with her performance. That\u2019s exactly what we needed to see. She did it. I didn\u2019t want to step in there and look like I was propping her up. I didn\u2019t have to,\u201d he added.Jackson is expected to be confirmed, both by the Judiciary Committee \u2015 which is expected to vote on Monday \u2015 and by the full Senate. So far, every Democrat appears to back her, and Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Wednesday that she will vote to confirm Jackson as well. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) believes more Republicans will also get on board.\u201cI believe that we\u2019re gonna get additional Republicans, but I can\u2019t tell you which ones right now, though. It\u2019s a very small number,\u201d she told reporters Wednesday. \u201cWe want more, and we\u2019re not going to be satisfied at one.\u201dSenior Front Page Editor, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostDays before Texas\u2019 Democratic primary elections on March 1, congressional candidate Jessica Cisneros was shuttling back and forth to a friend\u2019s house to shower and draw water for cooking. An estimated 125,000 Laredo residents had to boil their tap water for 13 days after the city\u2019s main water line ruptured in late February. Cisneros and her family were part of a smaller subset of residents whose water was shut off completely for five days.Laredo has issued a water boil notice six times since September 2019 for some or all residents because the local government was unable to guarantee the water\u2019s safety.The final pre-election disruption added a layer of inconvenience to Cisneros\u2019 packed campaign schedule.But it also reinforced her reasons for challenging nine-term U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar for the Democratic nomination in Texas\u2019 28th Congressional District.\u201cHe\u2019s had 17, 18 years to show the improvements in the community that he\u2019s been able to accomplish in his tenure,\u201d Cisneros told HuffPost. \u201cBut we don\u2019t even have water here.\u201dCoverage of Cisneros\u2019 two runs against the more conservative Cuellar \u2014 he defeated her by less than four percentage points in 2020 \u2014 has understandably focused on the two Democrats\u2019 major ideological and policy differences. But HuffPost\u2019s conversations with voters in Texas\u2019 28th suggest that their opinions of Cuellar\u2019s tenure and their relative appetite for change were more important indicators of their candidate preference than ideology. Now, as Cisneros prepares to face Cuellar in a May 24 runoff \u2014 neither candidate obtained an outright majority on March 1 \u2014 she is making the lack of consistent drinking water in Laredo, both candidates\u2019 hometown, a central part of her argument that the district needs new representation.Although the federal government is obviously not responsible for Laredo\u2019s water infrastructure, a core component of Cuellar\u2019s pitch to voters is that his seat on the House Appropriations Committee has brought the struggling district a steady flow of much-needed federal dollars, she noted.\u201cWhere\u2019s that money going to?\u201d Cisneros asked. \u201cBecause half of the city of Laredo didn\u2019t have running water\u201d as voters were casting ballots in Cuellar\u2019s reelection race.Cisneros has also seized on comments that Cuellar made that appeared to downplay his influence over local policymaking. Earlier this month, Cuellar told the Laredo Morning Times that while he would like to secure the city more federal funds to update the city\u2019s water infrastructure, his influence over the local government is limited.\u201cThat\u2019s a local issue,\u201d Cuellar said. \u201cCity Council should have done the replacement for many years, they just never did.\u201dTo Cisneros, that answer doesn\u2019t cut it. \u201cBeing a congressperson isn\u2019t just about what you vote on,\u201d Cisneros said. \u201cIt\u2019s about being a leader and making sure that you\u2019re generating pressure, bringing attention to issues, and making the effort to talk to voters directly about what their needs are and what the person in office can do to make sure those needs are met.\u201dAsked by HuffPost to respond to Cisneros\u2019 criticisms, Cuellar\u2019s office provided a lengthy statement from Cuellar documenting both the federal funding he has acquired for Laredo\u2019s water infrastructure and his efforts to coordinate with the local government.In the statement, Cuellar touted his work securing the appropriation of $35 million for the renovation of Laredo\u2019s Jefferson Water Treatment Plant in 2013 and claimed credit for helping ensure that the government of Laredo received $95 million from President Joe Biden\u2019s American Rescue Plan relief bill. He also said he voted for the bipartisan infrastructure bill that provided the state of Texas with $30 billion in funding, from which Laredo could benefit.In addition, Cuellar pointed out that he has been in frequent contact with the head of San Antonio\u2019s water authority, who has been advising Laredo on restoring clean water during the recent boil notices. Cuellar also said that he and his team have spoken often to Laredo Mayor Pete Saenz (D), city council members and their staffs about opportunities to apply for federal funding that might help the city update its water system. \u201cCongressman Cuellar not only has secured hundreds of millions of dollars to address the Laredo water issue, but has worked with the City directly to apply for eligible funding,\u201d Cuellar said in a statement. \u201cCongressman Cuellar will continue to be in constant contact with the Mayor and the City to work hand in hand to solve this local issue.\u201dCisneros has also sought to connect Laredo\u2019s water struggles to Cuellar\u2019s record of siding with the fossil-fuel industry against clean water regulation. In February 2017, mere days after then-President Donald Trump took office, Cuellar was one of just four House Democrats to vote in favor of overturning a federal rule aimed at protecting streams from coal mining waste. While the rule likely would have made some forms of coal mining not economically viable, the rule\u2019s defenders pointed to research showing it would also reduce the presence of contaminants in some regions\u2019 sources of drinking water. Amy Travieso, a former Cuellar deputy chief of staff-turned-U.S. Chamber of Commerce lobbyist, lobbied for passage of the law overturning the rule.Asked why Cuellar\u2019s support for a bill that only affected coal-mining regions was relevant to his record in Texas\u2019 28th, Cisneros told HuffPost it spoke to his callous approach to clean drinking water overall.\u201cIf he\u2019s willing to sell out the basic needs of those communities \u2014 drinkable, safe water \u2014 what would he do for this area as well?\u201d she said.The Cuellar campaign did not respond to a request for a response to Cisneros\u2019 criticism of the 2017 vote.As with any complicated infrastructure issue, there is no single explanation for Laredo\u2019s water troubles.On the one hand, the city\u2019s water challenges appear to stem from a lack of resources. The water line that ruptured in February is more than 50 years old. Replacing the central water pipes and tanks in just the city\u2019s core areas would cost $500 million, according to Saenz, Laredo\u2019s mayor.But several previous water boil notices were due to a lack of adequate chlorination of the water supply rather than a break in the water pipe. Some Laredoans, including a group of frustrated residents who have formed the grassroots group AGUAS \u2014 an acronym that spells out \u201cwaters\u201d in Spanish and translates to \u201cAction of People United for Safe Water\u201d \u2014 blame local mismanagement and corruption as well. They accuse the city government of failing to treat the problem with sufficient urgency in part because it disproportionately affects Laredo\u2019s less-prosperous south side and the unincorporated \u201ccolonia\u201d communities east of the city that lack representation on the city council.AGUAS has asked the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, or TCEQ, to penalize the city government for failing to notify residents about the low chlorine levels within 24 hours of the state agency confirming that a water boil notice was necessary in September 2019. \u201cOur one-dollar bill \u2014 it has the same value in the barrios as it has in other areas of Laredo, which are much wealthier and are better developed,\u201d said Carlos Blanco, an AGUAS activist who has stopped drinking tap water altogether.Blanco would not say whether he prefers Cuellar or Cisneros.But Cuellar\u2019s detractors believe that the congressman, who is also a former Texas state representative and Texas secretary of state, could use his considerable influence to facilitate greater changes in local governance.Not just an ordinary federal lawmaker, Cuellar\u2019s roots in Laredo run so deep that he is sometimes called the \u201cKing of Laredo.\u201d His brother Martin is the longtime sheriff of Webb County, where Laredo is located, and his sister Rosie served as county tax assessor. The Cuellar family has \u201cdone some good for the community,\u201d said Verennise Arellano, a Laredo school teacher who cited the water issues as part of the reason why she supported Cisneros in both 2020 and 2022. \u201cBut it gets to the point where you don\u2019t see any change anymore, where everyone is complacent.\u201dArellano is not exactly a card-carrying leftist. Despite the availability of more progressive candidates, she voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, and Joe Biden in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.She is instead motivated by a desire for change, even if it means taking a chance on someone without experience in elected office.\u201cWe need to have a fresh person,\u201d Arellano said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re wrong \u2014 Jessica might not be the person we\u2019re looking for. But we need the change.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostDespite a solid start, a lot of jokes at the 2022 Oscars fell flat \u2014 and Chris Rock wasn\u2019t the only comedian who facilitated a truly uncomfortable moment.Amy Schumer also did a bit during the ceremony in which she made Best Supporting Actress nominee Kirsten Dunst the butt of a bad joke that not only misread the room, but attempted to downplay the significance of Dunst\u2019s nomination.During the ceremony \u2014 and after actor Will Smith slapped Rock for making a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith\u2019s shaved head after years of her discussing her insecurities with alopecia \u2014 Schumer decided to make a joke about seat fillers.The comedian and Oscars co-host set up the joke by trying to explain seat fillers \u2014 non-famous people who hold celebrities\u2019 seats when they need to leave the room. But she must have thought a demonstration would make more sense.everyone\u2019s talking about will smith and chris rock at the #Oscars\u00a0 but did y\u2019all see this joke amy schumer did with jesse plemons and kirsten dunst that obviously didn\u2019t land and exuded the same amount of second hand embarrassment\u270b\ud83d\ude10 pic.twitter.com/R9iXhDDvvoShe then approached \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d star and Best Supporting Actor nominee Jesse Plemons, who was sitting next to his wife, Dunst, who was nominated for the same movie.\u201cOK, here\u2019s a seat filler. Honey, do you want to go to the bathroom?\u201d Schumer said, grabbing Dunst\u2019s hand and pulling her out of her seat.Schumer then sat in Dunst\u2019s seat and leaned over to Plemons.\u201cJesse I loved you in \u2018Power of the Dog,\u2019\u201d Schumer said. \u201cYou know, that was my wife, Amy,\u201d said Plemons, seemingly unamused.\u201cYou\u2019re married to that seat filler?\u201d Schumer said, trying to lighten the awkward moment.It was unclear if the bit was staged, but considering it followed Smith\u2019s slap, many people online were quick to compare Plemons\u2019 reaction to his wife being used as a comedy punchline with Smith\u2019s.Jesse Plemons could've been the hero of the Oscars if he had looked at Amy Schumer dead in the eye and said \"keep my wife's name out of your mouth\"But other Twitter users found the moment cringe-worthy for a completely different reason. More awkward moments at the Oscars: Amy Schumer, with one of the most unfunny jokes of all time, moved Kirsten Dunst out of her seat, calling her a \"seat filler,\" prompting husband Jesse Plemons to say \"you know that was my wife?\" pic.twitter.com/GrTKLH8dfaamy schumer calling kirsten dunst a seat filler and then flirting with jesse plemons just pissed me off especially since kirsten has been made fun of before by other people in the industry pic.twitter.com/UPKeEHBoezAmy Schumer just made a joke about Kirsten Dunst being a seat filler and Jesse Plemons (her husband) was not having it either. These jokes are notttt landing y'all. \ud83d\ude2d #oscarsI need to say this again Amy Schumer is not funny. Absolutely disrespectful, Jesse Plemons and Kristen Dunst  looked so damn uncomfortable. https://t.co/JcP2O7Q90Nthe strangest thing about this was that she said this joke to jesse. as if jesse plemons is some superstar and kirsten dunst is his nobody wife. like kirsten is significantly more famous than him what even was this joke?? https://t.co/cdVBkwrl6tobsessed with how much jesse plemons clearly hated this joke https://t.co/9fnqBmPIBzI think you have to be such a specific kind of out of touch to think that people who both know jesse plemons and kirsten dunst are a couple and want to laugh at their expense exist https://t.co/77QbO4wGlNDunst\u2019s Best Supporting Actress nomination for her role in \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d was her first Oscar nod. During her three-decade Hollywood career, she has been open about how she\u2019s often felt dismissed by the industry despite critically acclaimed performances in films like \u201cThe Virgin Suicides,\u201d \u201cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\u201d and \u201cMelancholia.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe they just think I\u2019m the girl from \u2018Bring It On,\u2019\u201d Dunst said of her starring role in the cult-classic film while speaking with SiriusXM host Larry Flick on his show \u201cIn Depth With Larry Flick\u201d in 2019.Meanwhile, her real-life partner Plemons has long been considered a legitimately talented actor since he followed up his beloved role in early aughts drama \u201cFriday Night Lights\u201d with a part in the critically acclaimed series \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201dAlthough it was the first Oscar nomination for both Plemons and Dunst (and neither took home the coveted prize for their individual categories), considering the stigma Dunst has had to face in her industry, perhaps the joke would\u2019ve landed better if Schumer had shooed Plemons out of his seat.Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostTaking her own controversial advice to heart, Kim Kardashian went to work on damage control over the backlash to recent comments she made about women in business. The reality TV mogul drew significant ire from just about all corners of the internet earlier this month when she offered up some \u201cadvice for women in business\u201d in a Variety interview about her famous family\u2019s ever-expanding media empire. \u201cGet your fucking ass up and work,\u201d Kardashian said in a clip that quickly went viral across social media. \u201cIt seems like nobody wants to work these days.\u201dSpeaking with Robin Roberts during a \u201cGood Morning America\u201d interview on Monday, Kardashian expressed some regret over the remark, which she said was \u201ctaken out of context.\u201d\u201cWell, that statement that I said was without questions and conversation around it,\u201d she told the \u201cGMA\u201d co-anchor. \u201cIt became a sound bite really with no context. And that sound bite came off the notion and the question right before, which was after 20 years of being in the business you\u2019re famous for being famous. And I ... my whole tone and attitude changed with the previous question that went into that question about what advice would you give to women.\u201dEXCLUSIVE: Kim Kardashian responds to backlash over women in business comments: \u201cIt wasn't a blanket statement towards women \u2026 it was taken out of context, but I\u2019m really sorry if it was received that way.\u201d@robinrobertshttps://t.co/kWY5S6eOU4 pic.twitter.com/C15OoEIJz2Kardashian went on to say she was referring specifically to people who believe simply appearing on a reality show or cultivating a large social media following is enough to be successful. \u201cYou have to really work hard to get there, even if it might seem like it\u2019s easy and that you can build a really successful business off of social media,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you can, if you put in a lot of hard work.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a blanket statement towards women or to feel like I don\u2019t respect the work or think that they don\u2019t work hard,\u201d Kardashian continued. \u201cI know that they do. It was taken out of context, but I\u2019m really sorry if it was received that way.\u201dThe remark sparked fierce criticism from Kardashian detractors. Many expressed outrage over the suggestion that women needed to work harder, especially given how the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately pushed women out of the workforce, with women of color bearing the brunt of job losses.According to data compiled by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, over 1 million women have left the labor force since February 2020, making up 68.5% of the total job losses since the start of the pandemic. Others mentioned Kardashian\u2019s privileged upbringing as another point of frustration, noting that many of the women she was criticizing were not raised in Beverly Hills by wealthy and famous parents \u2015 her father, Robert Kardashian, was a prominent and well-connected lawyer.A lawsuit filed by Kardashian\u2019s several past employees over unpaid wages only further inflamed tensions. Former workers in the reality star\u2019s gardening and maintenance staff of her Hidden Hills mansion have since accused her of being late with their pay and refusing to pay them overtime among other claims, according to Page Six.A spokesperson for the Kardashians refuted the claims, telling the outlet that the workers in question were \u201chired and paid through a third-party vendor\u201d and that the reality star has \u201chas never not paid a vendor for their services.\u201dIn the weeks since the Variety profile, Kardashian\u2019s remark has continued to bubble up, with Oscars co-host Regina Hall even poking fun at the reality TV star over the comment onstage at the ceremony on Sunday.Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden intends to propose a minimum tax of 20% on households worth more than $100 million and cut projected budget deficits by more than $1 trillion over the next decade, according to a fact sheets released Saturday by the White House budget office.The introduction of the minimum tax on the wealthiest Americans would represent a significant reorienting of the tax code. It would apply to the top 0.01% of households with half of the expected revenue coming from households worth $1 billion or more. The minimum tax would effectively prevent the wealthiest sliver of America from paying lower rates than families who think of themselves as middle class, while helping to generate revenues to fuel Biden\u2019s domestic ambitions and keep the deficit in check relative to the U.S. economy.In his proposal expected Monday, the lower deficits also reflect the economy\u2019s resurgence as the United States emerges from the pandemic. It\u2019s a sign that the government\u2019s balance sheet will improve after a historic burst of spending to combat the coronavirus.The fading of the pandemic and the growth has enabled the deficit to fall from $3.1 trillion in fiscal 2020 to $2.8 trillion last year and a projected $1.4 trillion this year. That deficit spending paid off in the form of the economy expanding at a 5.7% pace last year, the strongest growth since 1984. But inflation at a 40-year high also accompanied those robust gains as high prices have weighed on Biden\u2019s popularity.For the Biden administration, the proposal for the budget year that begins Oct. 1 shows that the burst of spending helped to fuel growth and put government finances in a more stable place for years to come as a result. One White House official, insisting on anonymity because the budget has yet to be released, said the proposal shows that Democrats can deliver on what Republicans have promised before without much success: faster growth and falling deficits.Yet the Biden budget would pledge to do so through a kind of wealth tax that many Republicans say would hurt the economy by diminishing private investment in companies that create jobs and cause the wealthy to put their fortunes to work abroad.Republican lawmakers have said that the Biden administration\u2019s spending over the past year has led to greater economic pain in the form of higher prices. The inflation that came with reopening the U.S. economy as the closures from the pandemic began to end has been amplified by supply chain issues, low interest rates and, now, disruptions in the oil and natural gas markets because of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky pinned the blame solely on Biden\u2019s coronavirus relief as well as his push to move away from fossil fuels.\u201cWashington Democrats\u2019 response to these hardships has been as misguided as the war on American energy and runaway spending that helped create them,\u201d McConnell said last week. \u201cThe Biden administration seems to be willing to try anything but walking back their own disastrous economic policies.\u201dBiden inherited from the Trump administration a budget deficit that was equal in size to 14.9% of the entire U.S. economy. But the deficit starting in the upcoming budget year will be below 5% of the economy, putting the country on a more sustainable path, according to people familiar with the budget proposal who insisted on anonymity to discuss forthcoming details.The lower deficit totals will also be easier to manage even if interest rates rise.The expected deficit decrease for fiscal 2022 reflects the solid recovery in hiring that occurred in large part because of Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. The added jobs mean additional tax revenue, with the government likely collecting $300 billion more in revenues compared to fiscal 2021, a 10% increase.Still, the country will face several uncertainties that could reshape Biden\u2019s proposed budget, which will have figures that don\u2019t include the spending omnibus recently signed into law. Biden and U.S. allies are also providing aid to Ukrainians who are fighting against Russian forces, a war that could possibly reshape spending priorities and the broader economic outlook.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The plan, in part, proposes raising income taxes for low-income Americans. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) rejected the proposal earlier this month, saying: \u201cWe will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years.\u201dRoberts also brought up those points, quoting directly from the plan. \u201cThat would raise taxes on half of Americans and potentially sunset programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWhy would you propose something like that in an election year?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s, of course, the Democrat talking points,\u201d Scott replied. \u201cNo, no, it\u2019s in the plan!\u201d Roberts exclaimed.

Last month, Scott got away with making false claims about his proposal on Fox News during an interview with Sean Hannity. He claimed it doesn\u2019t involve raising taxes, even though it does.His plan also addresses a variety of Republican culture war issues, including finishing former President Donald Trump\u2019s border wall, declaring that \u201cmen are men, women are women and unborn babies are babies,\u201d and preventing Democrats from trying to \u201crig elections.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostThree hosts, plenty of history-making awards and one shocking slap: so goes the story of the undeniably chaotic 94th annual Academy Awards.Largely returning to its pre-pandemic form at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles after last year\u2019s sized-down show, the 2022 ceremony aired on Sunday night and brought a protracted and strange award season to a messy finish.In an attempt to attract more eyeballs to the festivities after record-low ratings, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences instituted a variety of controversial changes for this year\u2019s telecast \u2015 adding two fan-voted races and demoting eight below-the-line and short film categories to a preshow presentation \u2014 which drew significant ire within the industry.But it was the unexpected moments that will surely cause all the conversation, most notably Will Smith smacking presenter Chris Rock on stage over a joke about his wife Jada Pinkett Smith moments before winning the Best Actor trophy. Still, there was plenty of drama to be had when it came to the onscreen contenders. Apple TV+\u2019s feel good dramedy \u201cCODA\u201d about a deaf family and their hearing daughter took home the Best Picture trophy in a watershed moment for disability representation in Hollywood. Netflix\u2019s tense (and yes, Sam Elliott, queer) Western \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d was at one point a clear front-runner to win the coveted prize, which would have given the streaming service a long-awaited trophy in the category after years of near misses. But in recent weeks, \u201cCODA\u201d pulled ahead in the betting after scoring top honors at the Producers Guild and Screen Actors Guild Awards, ultimately becoming the first film from a streaming service to win Best Picture at the Oscars.\u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d still managed to make an impact with Jane Campion picking up the Best Director prize, becoming the third woman to win the award, following Chlo\u00e9 Zhao in 2021 and Kathryn Bigelow in 2010.The show will indeed go down in the history books for some major milestones. The supporting actor and actress wins were especially noteworthy, with \u201cWest Side Story\u201d star Ariana DeBose becoming the first openly LGBTQ performer of color to take home an acting Oscar, while Troy Kotsur of \u201cCODA\u201d is now the first deaf man to win an acting trophy from the Academy.Somehow, COVID-19 protocols were among the least controversial elements of the broadcast. This year\u2019s attendees were required to show proof of vaccination and at least two negative PCR tests, while performers and presenters only needed to undergo testing. Nominee and potential EGOT winner Lin-Manuel Miranda was the only notable no-show after he pulled out of the ceremony over an abundance of caution due to his wife testing positive for COVID.For the first time since 2018, the chaos was managed by official Oscars hosts, with comedians Regina Hall, Wanda Sykes and Amy Schumer overseeing the proceedings. The trio appeared throughout the ceremony to infuse some fun into the show by openly roasting and thirsting after the A-list attendees.In between the jokes, there were also several mentions of current global events including the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine with the ceremony holding a 30-second moment of silence in a show of support. Toward the end of the ceremony, Jessica Chastain also spotlighted LGBTQ youth in her Best Actress acceptance speech, encouraging all those watching at home to \u201cknow that you\u2019re unconditionally loved for the uniqueness that is you.\u201dCheck out the list of nominees and winners below.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 A former gubernatorial candidate in Maine was bailed out of jail on Saturday after his arrest on charges of possession of child pornography.Officials with the Hancock County Jail said Eliot Cutler made bail in the afternoon after a day in custody. He had been held on $50,000 bail.The Maine State Police Computer Crimes Unit arrested Cutler without incident on Friday at a home he and his wife share in Brooklin, about 130 miles (210 kilometers) from Portland. The 75-year-old twice ran for governor as an independent, using his personal wealth to pay for the two unsuccessful campaigns.Cutler\u2019s attorney, Walt McKee, declined to comment to The Associated Press on Saturday.Warrants were executed on two of Cutler\u2019s homes earlier in the week. The counts correspond with crimes authorities said Cutler committed from December through March.However, materials were still being reviewed, and Hancock County District Attorney Matthew Foster has said it \u201cwouldn\u2019t surprise me if more charges were on the way.\u201dAuthorities said the investigation into Cutler began with a tip in December. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children informed Maine State Police that someone in Maine had either downloaded or uploaded a single illegal image.Cutler now faces four counts of possession of sexually explicit material of a child under 12, prosecutors have said. Each count carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.Officials with the jail said they had no information about when Cutler could appear in court.Cutler is a native of Bangor who has been involved in politics for decades, including a stint working under President Jimmy Carter. He ran for governor of Maine as an independent candidate in 2010 and narrowly lost a multi-candidate race to Republican Paul LePage. LePage would go on to serve two terms as governor and is running again this year.Cutler\u2019s second bid for governor came in 2014, when he came in a distant third.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

He said he couldn\u2019t even recall having a \u201csubstantive\u201d conversation with Cawthorn.Cawthorn on Tuesday also discussed another puzzling legislative agenda. He vowed to press to \u201cquadruple\u201d the number of homeschooled children in America.Cawthorn was homeschooled. He dropped out of college after a single semester. Late last year he called on conservative students to quit college, calling the education a scam. \u201cI am a proud dropout,\u201d he boasted.Twitter critics wholeheartedly agreed with Cawthorn\u2019s own estimation of his wisdom \u2014 and couldn\u2019t see any way Gingrich could help improve his situation.No shit.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostThe United States charged four Russian government employees in major hacking efforts targeting nuclear power plants, power companies, and oil and gas firms around the world, according to indictments made public Thursday by the Department of Justice.The indictments have been under seal since mid-2021 but were made public to bolster growing concerns that Russia may unleash cyberattacks against the U.S., Europe and other nations that have opposed its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.In one indictment from August 2021, Justice Department officials said three hackers from Russia\u2019s federal security service (FSB), the Kremlin\u2019s spy agency, worked to target and compromise the energy sector so it could \u201cdisrupt and damage such computer systems at a future time of its choosing.\u201d The hacking took place between 2012 and 2017, and targeted \u201cthousands of computers, at hundreds of companies and organizations, in approximately 135 countries,\u201d officials alleged. A second indictment from June 2021 homed in on an employee of Russia\u2019s ministry of defense and his co-conspirators, alleging Evgeny Viktorovich Gladkikh hacked a multinational energy company in 2017. Officials said the hackers installed malware that interfered with a refinery\u2019s safety systems.Gladkikh spent six months in 2018 researching how he could deploy a similar effort at U.S. refineries.Today, @TheJusticeDept unsealed charges against four Russian government actors for their roles in separate malicious #cyber campaigns targeting the U.S. energy sector. https://t.co/VoLQEHVGUv\u201cRussian state-sponsored hackers pose a serious and persistent threat to critical infrastructure both in the United States and around the world,\u201d Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said in a statement. \u201cAlthough the criminal charges unsealed today reflect past activity, they make crystal clear the urgent ongoing need for American businesses to harden their defenses and remain vigilant.\u201dThe four Russians are not in U.S. custody, but a Justice Department official told The Guardian that the \u201cbenefit of revealing the results of the investigation now outweighs the likelihood of arrests in the future.\u201d Russia does not extradite defendants to the United States, so the citizens will likely not be brought to trial.President Joe Biden has warned about the growing potential for Russian cyberattacks in recent days, saying he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin could soon turn to such tactics.\u201cThe more Putin\u2019s back is against the wall, the greater the severity of the tactics he may employ \u2026 one of the tools he\u2019s most likely to use, in my view, in our view, is cyberattacks,\u201d Biden told reporters on Monday. \u201cThe magnitude of Russia\u2019s cyber capacity is fairly consequential, and it\u2019s coming.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "RZESZOW, Poland (AP) \u2014 Just 60 miles from Ukraine, President Joe Biden saluted Poland on Friday for giving refuge to more than 2 million refugees who have fled Russia\u2019s invasion, then he met with humanitarian experts on the ground about what will be needed to mitigate the growing suffering.Biden said he had hoped to get even closer to the border but was prevented because of security concerns. Still, he said he wanted to visit Poland to underscore that the assistance it is providing is of \u201cenormous consequence\u201d as Europe experiences the biggest refugee crisis since World War II.\u201cIt\u2019s not stopping,\u201d Biden said of the devastation in Ukraine. \u201cIt\u2019s like something out of a science fiction movie.\u201dBiden also visited with some of the thousands of U.S. troops who have been sent near Poland\u2019s border to assist with the humanitarian emergency and to bolster the U.S. military presence on the eastern flank of NATO. More than 3.5 million Ukrainians have fled the country since the Feb. 24 invasion, including about 2.2 million to Poland, according to the United Nations.Within a few days, the number of refugees displaced from Ukraine since last month will exceed the number of Syrians routed from their homes over years of conflict after a 2011 uprising turned into a full-scale war, said Samantha Power, the U.S. Agency for International Development administrator.The American military commitment in Poland was apparent as soon as Air Force One touched down, rolling past Patriot missile batteries. More hardware, including heavy trucks and other equipment painted with dark green and brown camouflage, was present at the airport. A nearby convention center serves as a base for the U.S. Army\u2019s 82nd Airborne Division.Polish President Andrzej Duda joined Biden for a briefing with humanitarian experts.Duda, through an interpreter, thanked Biden for his support. He said the Poles see the Ukrainians they are receiving as their \u201cguests.\u201d\u201cThis is the name we want to apply to them,\u201d Duda said. \u201cWe do not want to call them refugees. They are our guests, our brothers, our neighbors from Ukraine, who today are in a very difficult situation.\u201dBiden\u2019s first stop was with 82nd Airborne troops, at a barber shop and dining facility where he invited himself to sit down and share some pizza. The Americans are serving alongside Polish troops.With the troops, he shared an anecdote about visiting his late son, Beau Biden, while he was deployed in Baghdad and going by his mother\u2019s maiden name so as not to draw attention to himself. The president jokingly razzed one service member about his standard-issue short haircut and seriously praised the troops, too.\u201cYou are the finest fighting force in the world and that\u2019s not hyperbole,. Biden said.He later addressed a group of soldiers in more formal remarks, telling them the nation \u201cowes you big.\u201d He also borrowed the words of the late Secretary of State Madeline Albright to underscore their place in a fragile moment for the U.S. and its European allies.\u201cThe secretary of state used to have an expression. She said, \u2018We are the essential nation,\u2019\u201d Biden told the troops. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound philosophical here, but you are in midst of a fight between democracy and an an oligarch.\u201dBiden will be in Warsaw on Saturday for further talks with Duda and others. The Polish leader had planned to welcome him at the airport on Friday, but his plane was delayed by a technical problem.White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Biden was looking to hear directly from the American troops and humanitarian experts about the situation on the ground and \u201cwhat further steps need to be taken to make sure that we\u2019re investing\u201d U.S. dollars in the right place.Biden, who spent Thursday lobbying U.S. allies to stay united against Russia, speculated that what he sees in Poland \u201cwill reinforce my commitment to have the United States make sure we are a major piece of dealing with the relocation of all those folks, as well as humanitarian assistance needed both inside Ukraine and outside Ukraine.\u201dSpeaking in Brussels after meetings with other world leaders, Biden said he had visited many war zones and refugee camps during his political career and \u201cit\u2019s devastating\u201d to see young children without parents or men and women with blank looks on their faces wondering, \u201cMy God, where am I? What\u2019s going to happen to me?\u201dHe said Poland, Romania and Germany shouldn\u2019t be left on their own to deal with the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.\u201cThis is an international responsibility,\u201d Biden said shortly after he announced $1 billion in additional assistance to help Ukrainian refugees. He also announced that the United States would take in up to 100,000 of those refugees. The White House has said most Ukrainian refugees eventually want to return home.Biden said the United States is obligated to be \u201cengaged and do all we can to ease the suffering and pain of innocent women and children and men\u201d who make it across the border.He said, \u201cI plan on attempting to see those folks ... I hope I get to see a lot of people.\u201dSome refugees interviewed Friday at the train station in Przemysl, Poland, said they hoped to eventually return to Ukraine. They also weren\u2019t very hopeful about Biden\u2019s visit.\u201cFor sure I do not have any expectations\u201d about Biden, said a tearful Ira Satula, 32, from Kremenchug. Satula was grateful for all the support and Poland\u2019s warm reception.\u201cBut home is home, and I hope we\u2019ll be there soon,\u201d Satula said.Olga Antonovna, 68, from Chernigov, said \u201cit\u2019s really 50-50\u201d that Biden will help enough.\u201cI think that we needed help a long time ago, long before,\u201d she said.Sullivan said Biden will give a speech Saturday on \u201cthe stakes of this moment, the urgency of the challenge that lies ahead, what the conflict in Ukraine means for the world.\u201d___Superville reported from Washington.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin announced Friday that he plans to vote for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the Supreme Court, likely assuring the confirmation of President Joe Biden\u2019s nominee.Manchin was a key vote to watch because he has bucked his party on some of its top domestic priorities. But Manchin has backed all of Biden\u2019s judicial nominees so far, and he said he would continue to do so in the case of Jackson, who would become the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court.\u201cI am confident Judge Jackson is supremely qualified and has the disposition necessary to serve as our nation\u2019s next Supreme Court Justice,\u201d Manchin said in a statement.Manchin\u2019s announcement indicates that Jackson will have the support of all 50 Senate Democrats. That would guarantee her confirmation, as Vice President Kamala Harris could break a tie.Even as the path clears for Jackson to join the court, Democratic hopes of securing significant Republican support for her nomination appear to be fading.On Thursday, just hours after the hearings came to a close, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell announced he will vote against Jackson\u2019s confirmation. He said in a Senate floor speech that he \u201ccannot and will not\u201d support her for a lifetime appointment.McConnell slammed the liberal groups that have supported Jackson, and he criticized her for refusing to take a position on the size of the nine-member court, even though that decision is ultimately up to Congress. Some advocacy groups have pushed for enlarging the court after three justices nominated by former President Donald Trump cemented a 6-3 conservative majority.McConnell also cited concerns about her sentencing of criminal defendants \u2014 a subject that dominated much of the four days of hearings and was part of a coordinated GOP effort to portray her as soft on crime.His position was expected and does not affect Jackson\u2019s trajectory to be confirmed by mid-April. But the leader\u2019s quick declaration could prompt many of his fellow Republicans to follow suit, thwarting Biden\u2019s efforts to bring back the overwhelming bipartisan votes  that were commonplace for Supreme Court nominees when he first came to the Senate five decades ago.\u201cI think whomever I pick will get a vote from Republican side,\u201d Biden said after Justice Stephen Breyer announced he would step down from the court this summer. As he started his search for a replacement, the president made a point of inviting Republican senators to the White House to hear their advice.Manchin cited a variety of factors that he said influenced his decision on Jackson, such as her attending public schools and going on to graduate with academic honors from Harvard University and Harvard Law School. He noted she also clerked for three federal judges and spent time in private practice and served on the U.S. Sentencing Commission. He then made a home state pitch.\u201cNotably, Judge Jackson and her family spend a great deal of time in West Virginia and her deep love of our state and commitment to public service were abundantly clear,\u201d Manchin said.While many GOP senators have praised Jackson\u2019s vast experience and qualifications, it was clear at the hearings that Biden\u2019s outreach had little effect.Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee interrogated Jackson about her nine-year record as a federal judge, frequently interrupting her answers. Jackson, supported by committee Democrats, pushed back aggressively on Republicans who said she gave light sentences to sex offenders, explaining her sentencing process in detail and telling them \u201cnothing could be further from the truth.\u201dThe focus on crime dovetails with an emerging GOP theme for this year\u2019s midterm elections and is likely to be decisive for many Republican senators. Others have brought up separate reasons to vote against her \u2014 from her support from liberal groups to her so-called \u201cjudicial philosophy.\u201dOne or more Republicans could still cast a vote for Jackson\u2019s confirmation, but the contentious nature of the four-day hearings laid bare a familiar partisan dynamic, seen over years of pitched fighting over judicial nominations.Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, who has been privately lobbying GOP colleagues to support Jackson, said after McConnell\u2019s announcement that it will be \u201csad for our country and sad as a commentary on where the parties are today\u201d if her historic nomination is approved on a strictly partisan vote. \u201cThe Republicans are testing their messages for the November election,\u201d Durbin said.Durbin said he is \u201cstill hoping that several Republicans \u2014 I hope many more\u201d will vote for her.As talk turned to the voting ahead, the Judiciary panel held its final day of Senate hearings Thursday with a top lawyers\u2019 group, which said its review found Jackson has a \u201csterling\u201d reputation and \u201cexceptional\u201d competence and is well qualified to sit on the Supreme Court.\u201cOutstanding, excellent, superior, superb,\u201d testified Ann Claire Williams, chair of the American Bar Association committee that makes recommendations on federal judges. \u201cThose are the comments from virtually everyone we interviewed.\u201dWilliams said the group spoke to more than 250 judges and lawyers about Jackson. \u201cThe question we kept asking ourselves: How does one human being do so much so extraordinary well?\u201dJackson would be the third Black justice, after Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas, and the sixth woman. She would also be the first former public defender on the court, and the first justice with experience representing indigent criminal defendants since Marshall. Her confirmation would not alter the current 6-3 conservative majority on the court.Durbin noted at Thursday\u2019s hearing that some Republican senators argued that Jackson was out of the mainstream when it comes to sentencing, and he asked the ABA whether such a concern would have surfaced in their interviews with the judges and lawyers who worked with her.\u201cIt never came up in any of these interviews,\u201d Williams said.During questioning Tuesday and Wednesday, GOP senators aggressively queried Jackson on the sentences she handed down to child pornography offenders in her nine years as a federal judge, her legal advocacy on behalf of suspected terrorists held at Guantanamo Bay, her thoughts on critical race theory and even her religious views.Many of the hours of questioning were spent on the specifics of the child pornography cases, with the discussion led by several GOP senators who are eyeing the presidency.Pushing back, Jackson said she bases sentences on many factors, not just federal guidelines. Sentencing is not a \u201cnumbers game,\u201d she said, noting that there are no mandatory sentences for sex offenders and that there has been significant debate on the subject. Democratic senators cited outside experts who said her sentences were within the norm.Some of those cases have given her nightmares, Jackson said, and were \u201camong the worst that I have seen.\u201dThe GOP criticism was countered by effusive praise from Democrats, and by reflections on the historic nature of her nomination. The most riveting came from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who used his time Wednesday not to ask questions but to tearfully speak and draw tears from Jackson as well.Booker, who is Black, said he sees \u201cmy ancestors and yours\u201d when he looks at Jackson.\u201cI know what it\u2019s taken for you to sit here in this seat,\u201d Booker said. \u201cYou have earned this spot.\u201d___Associated Press writers Mark Sherman, Jessica Gresko, Lisa Mascaro and Colleen Long in Washington and Aaron Morrison in New York contributed to this report.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2014 Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson vowed Monday in her opening remarks before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she would be an impartial justice on the high court if she is confirmed.\u201cI have been a judge for nearly a decade now, and I take that responsibility and my duty to be independent very seriously,\u201d Brown told members of the committee. \u201cI decide cases from a neutral posture. I evaluate the facts, and I interpret and apply the law to the facts of the case before me, without fear or favor, consistent with my judicial oath.\u201dJackson, 51, is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, a post she was confirmed to last year with bipartisan support. Her nomination by President Joe Biden is historic: She would be the first Black woman and first public defender on the Supreme Court.Monday marked the first day of Jackson\u2019s four-day confirmation hearing.\u201cDuring this hearing, I hope that you will see how much I love our country and the Constitution and the rights that make us free,\u201d she said. \u201cI stand on the shoulders of so many who have come before me, including Judge Constance Baker Motley, who was the first African American woman to be appointed to the federal bench \u2015 and with whom I share a birthday.\u201dJackson was joined Monday by friends and family, including her husband and two young daughters. She was introduced by Thomas Griffith, a conservative former U.S. appeals court judge appointed by President George W. Bush, and Lisa Fairfax, a former college roommate at Harvard who now teaches law. Griffith echoed Jackson\u2019s vow to be apolitical if confirmed, calling her \u201can independent jurist who adjudicates based on the facts and the law and not as a partisan.\u201dFairfax, who has been friends with Jackson for 35 years, called her \u201ca woman of deep faith in God and unyielding love of family\u201d and \u201cthe rock\u201d for their circle of friends.\u201cEven though we are the same age, she is the role model who makes you believe in what she said: \u2018You can do it, and here\u2019s how,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAnd she showed us how, by the power of her example of hard work, preparation and excellence that transforms the seemingly impossible into the achievable.\u201d\u201cWe knew early on that she could be anything she chose to be,\u201d Fairfax added, \u201cbut also, that she seemed destined to be a judge because of her ability to see all sides and render fair and level-headed decisions.\u201dMonday\u2019s hearing consisted mostly of pleasant introductory remarks. But starting Tuesday, members of the committee will begin asking Jackson questions about her record and judicial philosophy. Republicans have already signaled plans to attack her for being \u201csoft on crime,\u201d citing her representation of Guantanamo Bay detainees and her tenure on the U.S. Sentencing Commission.This line of attack is part of a broader GOP political effort to paint Biden\u2019s judicial nominees as \u201csoft on crime\u201d ahead of the 2022 midterm elections.\u201cThese baseless charges are unfair,\u201d Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) said in his opening remarks, referring to GOP accusations that Jackson has been too lenient with criminals.Sen. Chuck Grassley (Iowa), the top Republican on the panel, vowed that Jackson would be treated respectfully even as he said he has concerns with her judicial philosophy and with some of the progressive groups supporting her nomination.\u201cWe won\u2019t try to turn this into a spectacle based on alleged process fouls,\u201d Grassley said.\u201cIt won\u2019t be a circus,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) added. Nevertheless, he urged Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) to press Jackson over her record on sex offender sentencing guidelines, calling it \u201cvery fair game.\u201dLast week, Hawley launched a series of false and misleading attacks on Jackson claiming that she was too lenient on sex offenses during her tenure on the U.S. Sentencing Commission. But Hawley neglected to mention that most of Jackson\u2019s work was supported by conservative members of the panel and that her recommendations were well within the mainstream. His accusations were rebutted by the White House and independent fact-checkers.Hawley suggested Monday that, despite his pre-hearing attacks on Jackson, he wants the hearing to be respectful and fair.\u201cI\u2019m not interested in trapping Judge Jackson. I\u2019m not interested in playing gotcha,\u201d he said in his opening remarks. \u201cI\u2019m interested in her answers.\u201dBased on their opening remarks in Monday\u2019s hearing, Republicans appear to have settled on a scattershot approach to questioning Jackson \u2014 suggesting they don\u2019t have a clear line of attack on Biden\u2019s nominee. Their introductory comments all centered around the GOP\u2019s claims of Jackson being \u201csoft on crime,\u201d which aren\u2019t backed up by a closer look at her record; on Jackson\u2019s support by a progressive judicial advocacy group called Demand Justice, which has nothing to do with her record; and on the general need for civility and decorum in the hearing.Republicans know they have to be careful not to look like they are opposed to Jackson, who would be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, for any other reason than her judicial ideology. Delving into sensitive questions about her record of punishment for child pornography and sex offenses may not work out in Republicans\u2019 favor.Durbin has previously, and bluntly, accused Republicans of being unfairly hostile toward Black, female nominees who come before the committee. He told reporters this month that he is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about how they\u2019ll treat Jackson, noting that a previous Black female nominee received death threats after particularly hostile treatment by GOP members of the committee.Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), meanwhile, urged all of his colleagues to take a minute and feel \u201cthe overwhelming joy\u201d of Jackson\u2019s historic nomination. He\u2019s the only Black member of the committee and its second-ever Black member. Vice President Kamala Harris was the other one.\u201cI just want to talk about the joy,\u201d Booker said, beaming. \u201cI know tomorrow and in the coming hearings, we\u2019re going to have tough, hard questions. But please, let me just acknowledge the fact that this is not normal. It\u2019s never happened before. The Senate is poised right now to break another barrier.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that we, as a country, are continuing to rise to our collective, cherished, highest ideals.\u201dSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPostSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

She wept in the doorway of a crowded train compartment that was pulling into the western Ukrainian city of Lviv.The relief of being free from weeks of threats and deprivation, of seeing bodies in the streets and drinking melted snow because there was no water, was crushed by sadness as she thought of family members left behind.\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about them,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother, grandmother, grandfather and father. They don\u2019t even know that we have left.Seeing her tears, her 13-year-old son kissed her over and over, offering comfort.Mariupol authorities say nearly 10% of the city\u2019s population of 430,000 have fled over the past week, risking their lives in convoys out.For Galla, the memories are too fresh.For three weeks, she and her son lived in the basement of Mariupol\u2019s Palace of Culture to hide from the constant Russian shelling, moving underground after the horizon turned black with smoke.\u201cWe had no water, no light, no gas, absolutely no communications,\u201d she said. They cooked meals outside with wood in the yard, even while under fire.Even as they finally fled Mariupol, aiming to reach trains heading west to safety, Russian soldiers at checkpoints made a chilling suggestion: It would be better to go to the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol or the Russian-annexed Crimean Peninsula instead.It\u2019s a suggestion that residents found ludicrous after the Russians on Wednesday bombed a Mariupol theater where children and others were sheltering, and after authorities on Sunday said an art school holding hundreds of people in Mariupol had been bombed.For hours on Sunday\u2019s train journey, survivors shared their experiences with fellow passengers. Even residents of other Ukrainian cities that have been battered or occupied by the Russians see Mariupol as a horror apart.One resident of Melitopol, Yelena Sovchyuk, shared a train compartment with a Mariupol family. She bought them food, she said. They had nothing, only a small bag.\u201cEveryone from there is in deep shock,\u201d Sovchyuk said.She recalled seeing convoys from the besieged city on the road. \u201cThere\u2019s a way to tell a Mariupol car,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have no glass in their windows.\u201dWith deep disdain, Sovchyuk said Russian soldiers amid such devastation were still encouraging Ukrainians to come to Russia, claiming it would be for their safety.The Mariupol City Council has asserted that several thousand residents were taken into Russia against their will over the past week. On Sunday, the Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine said 2,973 people had been \u201cevacuated\u201d from Mariupol since March 5, including 541 over the last 24 hours.The train of survivors on Sunday afternoon approached the central station of Lviv, the city near Poland that has absorbed an estimated 200,000 people fleeing other areas of Ukraine. As they climbed off one by one into the arms of family and friends after weeks of fearing for their lives, some Mariupol survivors wept.A mother embraced a red-faced, teary teenage boy at the foot of the steps. An elderly woman in a kerchief, helped off the train, walked away in silence. Another stood motionless among her bags, blinking behind thick glasses. Her neighbor, who fled with her, described cars in their convoy coming under fire.Her hair askew, clutched by family, Olga Nikitina cried on the platform.\u201cThey began to destroy our city, completely, house after house,\u201d the young woman said. \u201cBattles took place over every street. Every house became a target.\u201dGunshots blew out the windows. When the temperatures in her apartment dropped below freezing. Nikitina moved in with her godmother, who has cancer and takes care of her elderly father. Ukrainian soldiers later came and warned them that their house would come under fire.\u201cEither hide or move out,\u201d the soldiers said.Nikitina left. The others were too fragile to flee. Now, like so many Mariupol survivors who escaped, she doesn\u2019t know the fate of those left behind.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A Senate committee has approved a bipartisan blueprint to overhaul the nation\u2019s public health system, applying the lessons of COVID-19 to future outbreaks through a new chain of command, a stronger medical supply chain, and clearer crisis communications.The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee approved the PREVENT Pandemics Act by a vote of 20-2 Tuesday.But it\u2019s only a first step. If the ambitious vision does eventually pass Congress, lawmakers must still deliver the tens of billions of dollars it will take to translate it into reality and maintain focus after the coronavirus recedes. Right now, Congress is even having trouble meeting a White House request for additional funds to keep COVID-19 at bay the rest of this year.\u201cWe owe it to everyone who has worked so hard to address the challenges of this pandemic to make sure we are never in a situation like this again,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray, (D-Wash.), chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.She and ranking Republican Richard Burr of North Carolina worked for over a year on the contours of the bill, which also calls for a national task force modeled on the 9/11 Commission to investigate what went wrong in the coronavirus response and make recommendations to the president and Congress. And the legislation incorporates creation of a new advanced medical research and development agency \u2014 dubbed ARPA-H \u2014 that President Joe Biden has called for.\u201cThe central issue facing us today is how can we better anticipate what threat we will face next, and innovate quickly enough to rise to the challenge,\u201d said Burr. \u201cThe future, unfortunately, is hard to predict.\u201dThe bill starts by formally placing responsibility for pandemic response \u2014 in Burr\u2019s words, \u201cmission control\u201d \u2014 within a new White House office, on a similar footing as national security. In the Obama White House, the National Security Council had a global health unit, but that was disbanded under the Trump administration.Congressional oversight of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would be strengthened by requiring Senate confirmation of its director. Confusion over CDC\u2019s health recommendations has been recurring problem in the pandemic, so the legislation calls for an advisory council to instruct health officials on how to get fact-based information across to the public more clearly.On the scientific front, the legislation takes multiple steps.They include more active surveillance of emerging diseases, building a capability to forecast epidemics and improving data collection and distribution. The Food and Drug Administration would be assigned a higher priority on medicines and countermeasures targeting infectious diseases.The bill calls for close attention to the medical supply chain, everything from raw materials for drug manufacturing, to protective equipment that was in such short supply in the first wave of the pandemic, to tests that continued to be an issue in the omicron wave.Two Republicans voted against the measure in committee, Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Braun of Indiana. Paul used the occasion to mount another attack on his nemesis, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert. Paul\u2019s amendment to strip Fauci of his post and break up his National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases was soundly rejected. He and Fauci have repeatedly and publicly clashed during the pandemic.How much money would be needed to make the blueprint a reality remains unclear.A new report estimates that overhauling U.S. public health and preparedness could take $100 billion in the first year, $20 billion to $30 billion in the following two years, and $10 billion to $15 billion annually thereafter.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to spend in proportion to the damage done, and the damage done has been huge,\u201d said Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel of the University of Pennsylvania, one of the authors. \u201cBeing penny-wise now would be foolish.\u201dSome major public health groups say they like the overall direction of the Senate bill but want to examine the details more closely before officially taking a stand. Dr. Georges Benjamin of the American Public Health Association said there\u2019s concern that making the CDC director a Senate-confirmed position might inject too much politics into the agency\u2019s work.\u201cObviously we are supportive of funding to rebuild the public system,\u201d said Benjamin, adding that \u201cwe have some questions about the bill as it has evolved.\u201dMeanwhile, Congress has still to act on Biden\u2019s request for $22.5 billion in immediate funding to maintain momentum on the COVID-19 response. The White House issued a new warning Tuesday of a potential rebound in virus cases if it doesn\u2019t get new money for vaccines, treatments and other priorities. Republicans have questions about how previously allocated funds have been spent and Democrats object to redirecting money that had already been promised to states.___Associated Press writer Alan Fram contributed to this report.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2015 Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) announced Monday he won\u2019t support President Joe Biden\u2019s nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve on the Federal Reserve Board, likey dooming her chances of confirmation. Biden\u2019s nominations of Raskin and two others to serve on the Federal Reserve Board have been stalled because of Republican opposition to Raskin. GOP members of the Senate Banking Committee have boycotted hearings on the nominations, citing Raskin\u2019s past statements advocating for the Fed to be more proactive in addressing the financial risks posed by climate change.Raskin, a former Fed governor and deputy treasury secretary, pledged in her confirmation hearing last month to be independent and to make it no more difficult for any industry to obtain bank loans, regardless of their impact on the climate.Nevertheless, Republicans have refused to allow a committee vote on her nomination. Caught in the fray are Biden\u2019s nominations of two other highly qualified and uncontroversial picks to serve on the Fed board. Neither has received votes in committee because Republicans refused to show up. \u201cI have carefully reviewed Sarah Bloom Raskin\u2019s qualifications and previous public statements,\u201d Manchin said in a statement on Monday. \u201cHer previous public statements have failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation\u2019s critical energy needs. I have come to the conclusion that I am unable to support her nomination to serve as a member of the Federal Reserve Board.\u201dManchin\u2019s opposition makes it exceedingly difficult for Raskin, the wife of Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), to be confirmed. Even if her nomination somehow received a vote in committee and proceeded to the full Senate floor, she would need the support of at least one Senate Republican to get the job, which isn\u2019t likely. The White House responded to Manchin\u2019s announcement by calling Raskin \u201cone of the most qualified people to have ever been nominated\u201d for the Federal Reserve Board and said it was still \u201cworking to line up the bipartisan support that she deserves\u201d to advance her nomination.But Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), who often votes for Biden nominees, said Monday she couldn\u2019t support Raskin, either.\u201cI think it\u2019s evident from Joe Manchin\u2019s statement that there is not a path forward for her,\u201d Collins added.Still, Raskin\u2019s supporters in Congress urged the White House not to give up on her nomination. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said it would be \u201ca terrible mistake\u201d if Raskin\u2019s nomination was pulled, while Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) noted Raskin was twice confirmed previously by the Senate via unanimous votes.Manchin, chair of the Senate Energy and Resources Committee, has long championed the coal and gas industry upon which his state (and his family) relies. The conservative West Virginia Democrat campaigned on killing President Barack Obama\u2019s climate change legislation in 2010. Last year, he delivered a fatal blow to President Joe Biden\u2019s Build Back Better bill, which included over $500 billion aimed at fighting climate change.Raskin would become the second major Biden nominee Manchin has sent packing. Early in 2021, Manchin refused support Neera Tanden\u2019s nomination to the Office of Management and Budget over her past mean tweets directed at some Republican senators, forcing the White House to withdraw the nomination.Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPostIdaho just became the first state to pass a law modeled after Texas\u2019 draconian six-week abortion ban that financially incentivizes private citizens to enforce the law.The Idaho House of Representatives passed S.B. 1309 on Monday evening in a 51 to 14 vote, just weeks after the Senate passed it. Republican Gov. Brad Little is expected to sign it into law, and it will likely go into effect sometime in April, months before a decision is expected in the U.S. Supreme Court case currently threatening the constitutional right to abortion. The bill is modeled after Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban that went into effect in September. The Idaho bill is somewhat different because it limits who can sue and who can be sued, unlike Texas, which allows anyone in the state to sue a person or provider who helps a woman get an abortion after the six-week point. In Idaho, the bill can only be enforced by the patient and their family members including the father of the fetus. Additionally, the only people who can be sued under the Idaho bill are abortion providers. In the Texas law, anyone from an Uber driver to a friend of a patient is vulnerable to a civil lawsuit. As is, abortion is out of reach for most people in Idaho: In 2017, 95% of Idaho counties had no abortion clinics, and 67% of Idaho women lived in those counties. The state currently has two \u201ctrigger bans\u201d on the books awaiting a Supreme Court decision: a waiting period for when a patient can get an abortion and restrictions on health care coverage for the procedure. Similar to Texas, this bill will likely disproportionately affect poor people, people of color and people who live in rural areas. Those who have the resources will travel across state lines, most likely to Washington and Oregon. Advocates expect a 385% increase of patients traveling into Washington state and about a 230% increase to Oregon, Lisa Humes-Schulz, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, told HuffPost last month. In December, the Supreme Court allowed the Texas law, including the extreme enforcement mechanism and the six-week abortion ban, to continue as the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the ban proceeded in lower courts. And just last week, the Texas Supreme Court, which is entirely made up of Republicans, dealt the final blow in the high-stakes court challenge, ruling that state officials are not responsible for enforcing Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban and therefore cannot be subjected to such lawsuits.The go-ahead from the Supreme Court galvanized many anti-abortion extremists to create and support more restrictions. \u201cWherever we go, whether that be in Texas or Nebraska or Ohio or Kentucky or Florida \u2026 we can go anywhere now and say, look, this enforcement mechanism has survived before the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d Mark Lee Dickson, the architect of the Texas abortion restriction, said in December.Missouri recently introduced a bill that could signal what\u2019s to come in the wake of laws like Texas\u2019 and Idaho\u2019s. Missouri state Rep. Mary Elizabeth Coleman recently introduced an amendment to several bills that would allow private citizens to sue anyone who \u201caids or abets\u201d a resident traveling to get an abortion outside of the state. The Missouri bill not only mirrors the enforcement mechanism in the Texas law but is also a response to what\u2019s happened in the Lone Star State since the law took effect: Many Texans have traveled to neighboring states or beyond to get abortions. The same is expected to happen in Idaho.The Idaho bill quickly and quietly passed through the state legislature, a deliberate move by Republican lawmakers, said Emily Halvorson, a press officer of state media campaigns at Planned Parenthood. \u201cYou didn\u2019t realize this was happening, and that was intentional,\u201d Halvorson told HuffPost last month. \u201cThey are doing it so quickly that there is not enough time for people to realize what\u2019s happening, and next thing you know they\u2019re going to wake up one day and abortion access is going to be effectively eliminated in the state. That\u2019s by design.\u201dSeveral other states have introduced copycat Texas legislation, including Arizona, Ohio, Alabama and Missouri. But the bill out of Ohio goes a step further and would ban abortion at any point in a pregnancy. Technically, Arkansas lawmakers did not formally introduce their bill but rather filed it during a special legislative session this fall. Oklahoma recently introduced a slew of anti-abortion measures, including a Texas copycat. The Sooner State is expected to be the next state to pass a bill modeled after the Texas law.Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Last night my very good friend Diego\u2019s grandson was medically kidnapped because a medical practitioner called CPS for a missed doctor appointment.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostRepublicans in the Wisconsin Legislature filed an emergency application with the U.S. Supreme Court on March 3, arguing that a new map of state legislative districts selected by the state\u2019s Supreme Court violates the Voting Rights Act.State Republicans argue that the redistricting plan constitutes a \u201c21st century racial gerrymander.\u201d In their filing to the U.S. Supreme Court, they argue that the map dilutes Black voting power by reducing the overall percentage of Black voters in each district.But those percentages were reduced in order to add a seventh Black-majority district in Milwaukee.This argument is \u201ca little odd\u201d coming from Republicans, said Mark Gaber, senior director of redistricting at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit that represented clients in the state litigation who favored the creation of a seventh Black district. That\u2019s because the map the Republican-controlled state legislature initially drew, and wants the Supreme Court to adopt, reduced the number of Black-majority districts from six to five.\u201cIt\u2019s a very aggressive move, and it\u2019s weaved in with a bunch of cynicism,\u201d Gaber said.Though the Republicans\u2019 argument that the court should reduce Black voting power on the legal basis that the alternative harmed Black voters appears to be particularly cynical, it fits with the Republican Party\u2019s efforts to reduce Black voting power across the country.The GOP push to block the redrawn district maps, approved by state courts, comes after a drawn-out legal battle. It began when the state legislature, whose Republican control was already bolstered by one of the most extreme cases of gerrymanding in the country, dating back to 2011, passed a new district map that would further cement the GOP advantage. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers vetoed their map.When the Wisconsin Legislature and the governor reached a stalemate on redistricting in three of the past four redistricting periods, over the last 40 years, they sought resolution through the federal courts. But this time the Republicans demanded that the case go through Wisconsin\u2019s state courts. The state Supreme Court currently has a 4-3 conservative advantage.The state courts decided to resolve the stalemate by choosing a redistricting map that made the \u201cleast change\u201d to the 2011 map, which already heavily favored the GOP. Parties to the lawsuit, including the legislature, the governor and other outside groups, were allowed to submit maps from which the court would pick.The GOP-majority legislature simply submitted the map that it had passed and that Evers had vetoed. Evers, however, submitted a new map that moved fewer people into new districts than did the legislature\u2019s map. And in a 4-3 decision, with conservative Brian Hagedorn joining the court\u2019s three liberals, the court selected Evers\u2019 map because it made the \u201cleast change\u201d to the 2011 redistricting.The court also found arguments that Milwaukee should have a seventh Black-majority district compelling because the 2020 census showed an increase in the Black population.\u201cIn assessing the information presented by the parties, we conclude there are good reasons to believe a seventh majority-Black district is needed\u201d to satisfy the Voting Rights Act, Hagedorn wrote for the majority. \u201cGovernor Evers\u2019 assembly map accomplishes this. For these reasons, we adopt Governor Evers\u2019 proposed remedial state senate and state assembly maps.\u201dAfter losing in their preferred venue, Wisconsin Republicans have now gone to the federal courts they evaded in 2021. And while the U.S. Supreme Court is now dominated by a 6-3 conservative majority, it is more likely than not they will reject the Republican legislature\u2019s appeal.On March 8, the court rejected two appeals from Republicans in North Carolina and Pennsylvania who wanted the court to toss court-drawn district maps they opposed. The court rejected these emergency applications based on the argument that such changes come too close to elections and would cause unnecessary confusion and disruption.The same could be said for the Wisconsin challenge. The state would need to have maps selected by March 1 so that candidates could begin circulating nominating petitions, Wisconsin Elections Commission administrator Meghan Wolfe told a state court in 2021.\u201cWhat we saw with the Pennsylvania and North Carolina cases telegraphed the same message for Wisconsin: The court is not going to swoop in moments before this election really gets under way and change the districts,\u201d said Mel Barnes, staff counsel for Law Forward, a nonprofit that represented groups opposed to the Wisconsin Legislature\u2019s maps in state litigation.There are other reasons why the court is unlikely to side with Republicans in the Wisconsin case.First, the parties to the emergency application lack standing, Gaber said, because they are not at risk of being personally harmed by the Voting Rights Act violations they allege.\u201cA racial gerrymandering claim requires someone who lives in the district and who is personally affected by the drawing of that district,\u201d Gaber said.Second, there are no alternative maps for the court to put in place if it were to strike down the map selected by the state\u2019s high court. Republicans want the Supreme Court to put in place the map they passed but that Evers vetoed and the state Supreme Court rejected. The Republican application does not even provide this map to the court.\u201cThey\u2019re saying that the Supreme Court should order in place the map that the legislature passed, that was vetoed by the governor \u2015 and they haven\u2019t even provided the map to the U.S. Supreme Court,\u201d Gaber said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like that.\u201dThe court is likely to decide on the Wisconsin Legislature\u2019s application in the next week. There is also an emergency application before the U.S. Supreme Court from Wisconsin Republicans challenging the congressional district map selected by the state courts. It faces similar hurdles.Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 U.S. authorities have broadly expanded the use of a smartphone app during the coronavirus pandemic to ensure immigrants released from detention will attend deportation hearings, a requirement that advocates say violates their privacy and makes them feel they\u2019re not free.More than 125,000 people \u2014 many of them stopped at the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 are now compelled to install the app known as SmartLink on their phones, up from around 5,000 less than three years ago. It allows officials to easily check on them by requiring the immigrants to send a selfie or make or receive a phone call when asked.Although the technology is less cumbersome than an ankle monitor, advocates say tethering immigrants to the app is unfair considering many have paid bond to get out of U.S. detention facilities while their cases churn through the country\u2019s backlogged immigration courts. Immigration proceedings are administrative, not criminal, and the overwhelming majority of people with cases before the courts aren\u2019t detained.Advocates said they\u2019re concerned about how the U.S. government might use data culled from the app on immigrants\u2019 whereabouts and contacts to round up and arrest others on immigration violations.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of been shocking how just in a couple of years it has exploded so quickly and is now being used so much and everywhere,\u201d said Jacinta Gonzalez, senior campaign director for the Latino rights organization Mijente. \u201cIt\u2019s making it much easier for the government to track a larger number of people.\u201dThe use of the app by Immigration and Customs Enforcement soared during the pandemic, when many government services went online. It continued to grow as President Joe Biden called on the Department of Justice to curb the use of private prisons. His administration has also voiced support for so-called alternatives to detention to ensure immigrants attend required appointments such as immigration court hearings.Meanwhile, the number of cases before the long-backlogged U.S. immigration court system has soared to 1.6 million. Immigrants often must wait for years to get a hearing before a judge who will determine whether they can stay in the country legally or should be deported.Since the pandemic, U.S. immigration authorities have reduced the number of immigrants in detention facilities and touted detention alternatives such as the app.The SmartLink app comes from BI Inc, a Boulder, Colorado-based subsidiary of private prison company The GEO Group. GEO, which runs immigration detention facilities for ICE under other contracts, declined to comment on the app.Officials at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, declined to answer questions about the app, but said in a statement that detention alternatives \u201care an effective method of tracking noncitizens released from DHS custody who are awaiting their immigration proceedings.\u201dIn recent congressional testimony, agency officials wrote that the SmartLink app is also cheaper than detention: it costs about $4.36 a day to put a person on a detention alternative and more than $140 a day to hold someone in a facility, agency budget estimates show.Advocates say immigrants who spent months in detention facilities and were released on bond are being placed on the app when they go to an initial meeting with a deportation officer, and so are parents and children seeking asylum on the southwest border.Initially, SmartLink was seen as a less intensive alternative to ankle monitors for immigrants who had been detained and released, but is now being used widely on immigrants with no criminal history and who have not been detained at all, said Julie Mao, deputy director of the immigrant rights group Just Futures. Previously, immigrants often only attended periodic check ins at agency offices.\u201cWe\u2019re very concerned that that is going to be used as the excessive standard for everyone who\u2019s in the immigration system,\u201d Mao said.While most people attend their immigration court hearings, some do skip out. In those cases, immigration judges issue deportation orders in the immigrants\u2019 absence, and deportation agents are tasked with trying to find them and return them to their countries. During the 2018 fiscal year, about a quarter of immigration judges\u2019 case decisions were deportation orders for people who missed court, court data shows.Advocates questioned whether monitoring systems matter in these cases, noting someone who wants to avoid court will stop checking in with deportation officers, trash their phone and move, whether on SmartLink or not.They said they\u2019re concerned that deportation agents could be tracking immigrants through SmartLink more than they are aware, just as commercial apps tap into location data on people\u2019s phones.In the criminal justice system, law enforcement agencies are using similar apps for defendants awaiting trial or serving sentences. Robert Magaletta, chief executive of Louisiana-based Shadowtrack Technologies, said the technology doesn\u2019t continually track defendants but records their locations at check ins, and that the company offers a separate, full-time tracking service to law enforcement agencies using tamperproof watches.In a 2019 Congressional Research Service report, ICE said the app wasn\u2019t continually monitoring immigrants. But advocates said even quick snapshots of people\u2019s locations during check ins could be used to track down friends and coworkers who lack proper immigration authorization. They noted immigration investigators pulled GPS data from the ankle monitors of Mississippi poultry plant workers to help build a case for a large workplace raid.For immigrants released from detention with ankle monitors that irritate the skin and beep loudly at times, the app is an improvement, said Mackenzie Mackins, an immigration attorney in Los Angeles. It\u2019s less painful and more discreet, she said, adding the ankle monitors made her clients feel they were viewed by others as criminals.But SmartLink can be stressful for immigrants who came to the U.S. fleeing persecution in their countries, and for those who fear a technological glitch could lead to a missed check in.Rosanne Flores, a paralegal at Hilf and Hilf in Troy, Michigan, said she recently fielded panicked calls from clients because the app wasn\u2019t working. They wound up having to report in person to immigration agents\u2019 offices instead.\u201cI see the agony it causes the clients,\u201d Flores said. \u201cMy heart goes out to them.\u201d___Taxin reported from Orange County, California.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A $13.6 billion emergency package of military and humanitarian aid for besieged Ukraine and its European allies easily won final congressional approval, hitching a ride on a government-wide spending bill that\u2019s five months late but loaded with political prizes for both parties.With Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion killing thousands and forcing over 2 million others to flee, the Senate approved the $1.5 trillion overall legislation by a 68-31 bipartisan margin late Thursday. Democrats and Republicans have battled this election year over rising inflation, energy policy and lingering pandemic restrictions, but they\u2019ve rallied behind sending aid to Ukraine, whose stubborn resilience against brutal force has been inspirational for many voters.\u201cWe promised the Ukrainian people they would not go at it alone in their fight against Putin,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said just before the vote. \u201cAnd once we pass this funding in a short while, we will keep that promise.\u201dThe House passed the compromise bill easily Wednesday. President Joe Biden\u2019s signature was certain.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said approval \u201cproves once more that members of both parties can come together to deliver results for the American people\u201d \u2014 a phenomenon in short supply in recent years.She also prodded lawmakers to revive money \u201curgently needed to prevent severe disruptions to our COVID response.\u201d In an embarrassment to Biden and Democratic leaders who\u2019d made it a top priority, the House on Wednesday dropped the measure\u2019s $15.6 billion for continuing efforts to battle the pandemic after rank-and-file lawmakers balked at cuts in aid states had been promised.Around half the $13.6 billion measure for the war was for arming and equipping Ukraine and the Pentagon\u2019s costs for sending U.S. troops to other Eastern European nations skittish about the warfare next door. Much of the rest included humanitarian and economic assistance, strengthening regional allies\u2019 defenses and protecting their energy supplies and cybersecurity needs.Republicans strongly backed that spending. But they criticized Biden for moving too timidly, such as in the unresolved dispute with Poland over how that nation could give MiG fighter jets to Ukraine that its pilots know how to fly.\u201cThis administration\u2019s first instinct is to flinch, wait for international and public pressure to overwhelm them, and then take action only after the most opportune moment has passed us by,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.White House aides told Congress last month that Biden wanted $6.4 billion to counter Russia\u2019s invasion. He ended up formally requesting $10 billion, an amount that it took an eager Congress just a few days to boost to its final figure of $13.6 billion.The $1.5 trillion bill carrying that aid gave Democrats a near 7% increase for domestic initiatives, which constituted a bit less than half the package. That translated to beefed-up spending for schools, housing, child care, renewable energy, biomedical research, law enforcement grants to communities and feeding programs.The measure also directs money to minority communities and historically black colleges, renews efforts aimed at preventing domestic violence against women and requires infrastructure operators to report serious hacking incidents to federal authorities.Republicans lay claim to an almost 6% boost for defense, including money for 85 advanced F-35 fighter planes, 13 new Navy ships, upgrades for 90 Abrams tanks and improvements for schools on military bases. There would be another $300 million for Ukraine and $300 million for other Eastern European allies on top of the measure\u2019s emergency funding.The GOP also prevailed in retaining decades-old restrictions against using federal money to pay for nearly all abortions. And they forced Biden to abandon goals for his 2022 budget \u2014 politically implausible from the start \u2014 that envisioned 16% domestic program increases and defense growth of less than 2%.Besides those policy victories, many lawmakers of both parties had one incentive to back the spending package that they have not enjoyed since 2010. Democratic leaders restored the old practice of earmarks, hometown projects for lawmakers that Congress dropped in 2011 because voters viewed it as a sleazy misspending of taxpayers\u2019 money.The practice restored, the expansive bill was laced with thousands of the projects at a price tag of several billion dollars. Years ago, the numbers were often higher.Affirming the practice\u2019s popularity, the Senate rejected an amendment by Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., to strip the earmarks. Braun said they encompassed 367 pages that weighed five pounds and showed \u201cthe swamp is rising again.\u201d The amendment\u2019s defeat by a bipartisan 64-35 margin spoke for itself.Government agencies have operated under last year\u2019s lower spending levels since the new fiscal year began Oct. 1 because, as usual, Congress hadn\u2019t approved any bills by then updating those amounts.Months of talks produced the compromise spending pact this week. With the latest temporary spending measure expiring Friday night, Biden\u2019s signature of the $1.5 trillion bill would avert a weekend federal shutdown, which was never going to happen because neither party had reason to spark such a battle.The Senate sent Biden a separate bill financing agencies through Tuesday in case it takes time to complete the required reprinting and proofreading of the lengthy measure.A lot has happened since Oct. 1, much of it challenging for Democrats. Biden\u2019s polling numbers have sunk, high inflation has persisted and gasoline prices have jumped. Omicron\u2019s fade has left voters impatient to end pandemic restrictions, Biden\u2019s marquee social and environment bill has crashed and Russia has invaded Ukraine.With that election-year backdrop, Democrats saw the $1.5 trillion package as their chance to claim wins.Currently controlling both the White House and Congress, Democrats could lose their narrow House and Senate majorities in November\u2019s midterm elections, meaning this could be the peak of their ability to win policy priorities for years. Before last year, the last time they controlled both branches was in 2010.The largesse has been enabled, in part, by both parties\u2019 relaxed attitudes toward gargantuan federal deficits.Last year\u2019s pandemic-fueled shortfall of $2.8 trillion was the second worst ever. It was so high that Biden has suggested that this year\u2019s projected $1.8 trillion gap would be an accomplishment because it would be $1 trillion smaller, the biggest reduction ever.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostThe Biden administration on Wednesday restored California\u2019s legal authority to set its own emissions standards for cars and trucks in an attempt to better address climate change.The restoration comes after former President Donald Trump withdrew California\u2019s ability to set its own tailpipe emissions standards in 2019, part of a broader effort to eviscerate the nation\u2019s environmental policies.California first received a waiver under the Clean Air Act to create the tougher standards as a way to address its smog problems. The state has also been a leader in electric vehicle adoption.Trump\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t supported by the auto industry. In fact, five major car manufacturers signed a deal with California in 2020 to voluntarily follow the state\u2019s emissions standards even though they weren\u2019t required to by law.On Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency recognized California\u2019s \u201clongstanding\u201d efforts to be a leader in addressing pollution from vehicles, and said the agency\u2019s \u201cpartnership with states to confront the climate crisis has never been more important.\u201d\u201cWith today\u2019s action, we reinstate an approach that for years has helped advance clean technologies and cut air pollution for people not just in California, but for the U.S. as a whole,\u201d EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement. The impact of this change could be monumental.According to The New York Times, California is the most populous state and the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy. California lawmakers\u2019 actions reverberate throughout the auto industry and have been adopted by many other states.Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said Wednesday the state would only continue its transition towards zero-emission vehicles. As part of an effort to phase out the sale of gasoline-powered cars by 2035, the state plans to increase electric vehicle requirements by 2030.\u201cThe restoration of our state\u2019s Clean Air Act waiver is a major victory for the environment, our economy, and the health of families across the country that comes at a pivotal moment underscoring the need to end our reliance on fossil fuels,\u201d Newsom said in a statement. \u201cCalifornia looks forward to partnering with the Biden Administration to make a zero-emission future a reality for all Americans.\u201dPresident Joe Biden has also worked to hasten the adoption of electric vehicles. He signed an executive order last year to see the U.S. have half of all cars sold be electric, fuel cell or plug-in hybrids by 2030.Fossil fuels from transportation are the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the nation, clocking in at 29% of America\u2019s total.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The House overwhelmingly approved legislation Wednesday night that would ban Russian oil imports to the United States, an effort to put into law the restrictions announced by President Joe Biden in response to the escalating war in Ukraine.Going further than Biden\u2019s import ban on Russian oil, the bill making its way through Congress would also encourage a review of Russia\u2019s status in the World Trade Organization and signal U.S. support for sanctions on Russian officials over human rights violations, as the U.S. works to economically isolate the regime.Lawmakers in both parties have been eager to act, willing to risk higher gas prices at home in order to support Ukraine with a show of U.S. bipartisanship. The legislation was approved Wednesday, 414-17, and now goes to the Senate.Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, who helped draft the bill, acknowledged it may cost more to fill up tanks at home to stop Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s tanks abroad.\u201cIt is one way to demonstrate our solidarity,\u201d Doggett said during the debate.The remarkable bipartisan resolve in Congress to deter Russia and help Ukraine has acted as an accelerant on the White House\u2019s own strategy, pushing the Biden administration to move more quickly than it would have \u2014 a rare example of the legislative branch muscling its way into foreign policy.Just days ago, the Biden administration was reluctant to ban Russian oil imports, worried about reducing the global energy supply and causing spikes in gas prices at a time when U.S. households already face record-setting inflation.\u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about doing the Russian (energy) ban for a while, and we\u2019re so pleased the president has done that,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said ahead of the vote.While Russian oil makes up only a small part of U.S. imports, it carries a high price for lawmakers in Congress who viewed the ban as a moral test in blocking an economic lifeline for Putin\u2019s regime. Lawmakers appeared especially moved by Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy\u2019s \u201cdesperate plea\u201d for help during a weekend video call with lawmakers.\u201cWe stand with the people of Ukraine, Democrats and Republicans alike,\u201d said Rep. Lloyd Smucker, R-Pa.House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy said Republicans would have preferred a tougher bill on Russia, alongside efforts to allow more energy production in the U.S. Nevertheless, they wanted to send a show of support.\u201cOur conference overwhelmingly does not want Russian oil; we want American oil,\u201d McCarthy said.The GOP leader distanced himself from former President Donald Trump\u2019s views that Putin is a \u201cgenius\u201d for his Ukraine strategy.\u201cI do not think anything savvy or genius about Putin. I think Putin is evil. He\u2019s a dictator,\u201d McCarthy said.The action comes as Congress is on track to approve nearly $14 billion in military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine, a package that has swelled in size as the brutality of the war intensifies. More than 2 million Ukrainians have fled the country in the most rapid exodus since World War II.The legislation in many ways is symbolic, since Biden has already announced the Russian oil ban. But the legislative push sets up the next showdown over Russia\u2019s trade status as Congress presses for restrictions on other imports from Russia that the administration has so far resisted.The White House intervened over the weekend as key lawmakers from both the House and Senate prepared a more punitive bill that would begin to strip Russia of its permanent normal trade relation status \u2014 a move that would have opened the door to tariffs on other goods coming from Russia to the U.S.Amid the administration\u2019s objections, Democratic leaders in Congress shelved the emerging bill rather than forcing a confrontation with their party\u2019s president.Instead, the new legislation approved by the House stops short of suspending Russia\u2019s normal trade status. Rather, it calls for a review of Russia\u2019s status at the World Trade Organization. The House bill also says the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act should be bolstered to allow the president to impose sanctions on any foreign person who has \u201cdirectly or indirectly engaged in serious human rights abuse.\u201dThe Democrats in Congress are toggling between pushing their priorities and allowing the Biden administration leeway as it works with allies in Europe and beyond to stop Putin\u2019s war.Senators, though, remain eager to curb Russian trade with restrictions on imports to the U.S., and Republican senators may try to amend the bill once it comes up for a Senate debate, likely in the week ahead. The bipartisan bill as initially drafted would have suspended normal trade relations with Russia as well as Belarus, the neighboring Russian ally that has been used as a launch point for incursions into northern Ukraine.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 More than 27,000 mail ballots in Texas were flagged for rejection in the first test of new voting restrictions enacted across the U.S., jeopardizing votes cast by Democrats and Republicans alike and in counties big and small, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.It puts the rate of rejected mail ballots in Texas on track to significantly surpass previous elections. The preliminary figures \u2014 reported by Texas counties after votes were counted in the state\u2019s March 1 primary \u2014 is the fullest picture to date of how new election rules rushed into place by Republicans following the 2020 election made it harder for thousands of voters in both parties. Some will wind up not having their ballots count at all.Rejected mail ballots are relatively uncommon in a typical election. But the initial rejection rate among mail voters in the Texas primary was roughly 17% across 120 counties, according to county-by-county figures obtained by AP. Those counties accounted for the vast majority of the nearly 3 million voters in Texas\u2019 first-in-the-nation primary.Although the final number of discounted ballots will be lower, the early numbers suggest Texas\u2019 rejection rate will far exceed the 2020 general election, when federal data showed that less than 1% of mail ballots statewide were rejected.\u201cIt took me three tries and 28 days but I got my ballot and I voted,\u201d said Pamiel Gaskin, 75, of Houston. Like many rejected mail voters, she did not list a matching identification number that Texas\u2019 new law requires.For now, the numbers do not represent how many Texas ballots were effectively thrown out. Voters had until Monday to \u201cfix\u201d rejected mail ballots, which in most cases meant providing identification that is now required under a sweeping law signed last fall by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. County election officers say they worked feverishly to contact those voters in time, in many cases successfully, and a full and final tally of rejected ballots in Texas is expected to come into focus in the coming days.But already, scores of mail ballots have been disqualified for good.Along the Texas border, El Paso County reported that 725 mail ballots were officially rejected and not counted after a final canvass Monday \u2014 about 16% of all such ballots cast. In the booming suburbs of Austin, Williamson County had a final number of 521 rejected ballots, nearly evenly split evenly between Republican and Democratic primary voters.Roughly 8,300 mail ballots in Texas were rejected in the 2020 election, according to the U.S. Elections Assistance Commission.Some rejected mail voters could have casted a ballot in person later. Antonio Riveria, El Paso County\u2019s assistant elections administrator, said Wednesday that number is unknown in his office. But they typically reject significantly fewer mail ballots.\u201cIt\u2019s a lot less. Maybe 10,\u201d he said.The numbers underline how voters across Texas \u2014 in big cities and rural outposts, red and blue \u2014 were tripped up by the new law that Abbott and other Republicans assured would make it \u201ceasier to vote and harder to cheat.\u201d At least 17 other states will also vote this year under new voting laws, many pushed by Republican lawmakers who especially took aim at mail ballots after states expanded options to make voting safer during the coronavirus outbreak. Some of the restrictions were fueled by the continued false claims in the GOP about widespread fraud in President Joe Biden\u2019s victory.Abbott\u2019s office did not return requests for comment about the number of rejected ballots.Texas Secretary of State John Scott, who Abbott appointed as the state\u2019s chief election officer, has called the high rate of rejections a matter of voters not being familiar with the new rules and expressed confidence that the numbers will drop in future elections.Texas\u2019 new mail voting rules require voters to return ballots with a personal identification number \u2014 such as a driver\u2019s license number \u2014 which then must match the number in voter registration files. Other new rules in Texas ban drive-thru voting and 24-hour polling centers and make it a felony for a government official to solicit mail ballots.The law also requires counties to publicly post a one-page \u201creconciliation report\u201d of voters and ballots after each election as an extra measure of transparency. The report instructs counties to include the number of mail ballots and how many were flagged for rejection.The AP obtained reports from 120 counties \u2014 nearly half of the 254 in Texas \u2014 through county websites and contacting all counties that had not posted a report publicly.In Texas\u2019 largest county, around Houston, Harris County officials said more than 11,000 mail ballots had been flagged for rejection as of March 2. But in the county\u2019s preliminary report that is dated a day later, the number of rejected mail ballots was listed at 3,277. On Tuesday, Harris County Elections Administrator Isabel Longoria said she was stepping down following a bungled vote count.Houston Democrats have been among the most outspoken over Texas\u2019 new voting laws, which they say are designed to weaken minority turnout. But Republican-leaning counties struggled with the new rules as well.In Parker County, which former President Donald Trump carried by a 4-to-1 margin in 2020, the county reported 250 mail ballots as rejected or pending out of 1,100 mail votes \u2014 about 23%. Along the Texas coast in Nueces County, which Trump narrowly won, the rejection rate was 8%.Kara Sands, the election administrator in Nueces County, said her office pressed voters to include more than one identification number as a guardrail against having their ballot rejected. But she said her office wasn\u2019t inundated with voter frustration.\u201cWe really didn\u2019t get a lot of folks complaining about that,\u201d she said.Texas holds primary runoffs in May, and elections officials say their goal now is to educate voters to avoid a repeat next time. Christopher Davis, the elections administrator in Williamson County, said the final rejection rate of 11.5% was \u201cby far the highest we have ever seen\u201d in the county of more than 600,000 people.\u201cThe hope is we knock down that rejection rate,\u201d he said.___Associated Press data journalist Aaron Kessler in Washington contributed to this report.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

It was a long awaited homecoming for many after a year away due to the pandemic.Before the lunch, nominees excitedly greeted one another. Will Smith and Denzel Washington, both best actor nominees this year, smiled and grabbed each other\u2019s hands. \u201cCODA\u201d Star Emilia Jones was signing with co-star Daniel Durant, who plays her brother in the movie.Kristen Stewart arrived with her fiance Dylan Meyer, circling the room in her Chanel outfit, while Netflix exec Ted Sarandos shook hands with Questlove, whose documentary \u201cSummer of Soul\u201d is nominated. Benedict Cumberbatch made his way around holding hands with wife Sophie Hunter.Nominees continued mingling, ignoring the pleas to be seated.\u201cJust being back together without a hazmat suit is cause for celebration,\u201d said Will Packer, who is producing the show this year. \u201cThis is a year like no other, this is THE year.\u201dDuring lunch most chose to ignore their quinoa salad. Bradley Cooper made sure to say hello to Questlove. Steven Spielberg was deep in conversation Paul Thomas Anderson. Both are nominated for best director.The luncheon was a first for many including Andrew Garfield, a best actor nominee for \u201ctick, tick\u2026Boom.\u201d He said it was a \u201cspecial moment\u201d to be among fellow nominees like \u201cPTA and Ariana,\u201d referring to Anderson and best supporting actress front-runner Ariana DeBose from \u201cWest Side Story\u201d who were standing close by.Kim Morgan, the \u201cNightmare Alley\u201d screenwriter, was a little overwhelmed by the experience which was also her first time. \u201cI\u2019m a writer,\u201d she said.Osnat Shurer, an animation nominee for \u201cRaya and the Last Dragon,\u201d said it was a joy to be at the luncheon. She was excited to tell Jessica Chastain that she loved her performance in \u201cThe Eyes of Tammy Faye.\u201d What she didn\u2019t expect was that Chastain was also a fan and frequent watcher of \u201cRaya,\u201d thanks to her children.Near the end of the festivities, Washington gave big hugs to Garfield and \u201cBelfast\u201d director Kenneth Branagh, while supporting actor nominee Troy Kotsur made his way over to embrace Bradley Cooper, who is a best picture nominee as a producer of \u201cNightmare Alley.\u201dTop of mind for many were the changes to the broadcast, in which eight categories are going to be presented off air before the show. While many have spoken out against the decision, some are supportive too.At Spielberg\u2019s table was Penelope Cruz, who is nominated nominated for her work in the film \u201cParallel Mothers\u201d which is entirely in Spanish.The experience, she said was \u201cVery emotional\u201d and she\u2019s also happy \u201cto see how the Academy opens a little more every year.\u201d Her husband Javier Bardem is also nominated for his work in \u201cBeing the Ricardos.\u201dCruz said she was not happy about the decision to hand out some of the awards before the broadcast.\u201cEvery single category is important,\u201d Cruz said.\u201cI believe that when people are watching the ceremony they know we depend on (them)..all these departments are equally important.\u201d\u201cDune\u201d director Denis Villeneuve said he\u2019s worried that the nominees in the categories \u201cfeel humiliated.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very sad, too, when it\u2019s supposed to be a celebration,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how it goes this year. I\u2019ll be there at 4 p.m. to clap \u2026 for my all of my collaborators, for everybody.\u201dBill Corso, an Oscar winning hair and makeup artist, is one who was on the committee that made the decision. In 2004, he was given his Oscar in the aisle, another attempt to streamline the broadcast and, he said, it felt like he didn\u2019t get his moment.This change he hopes will let the winners have that moment on stage at the podium, which will be edited into the broadcast in a way that won\u2019t be obvious to the viewing audience.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Dozens of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officials have signed a letter released Monday urging the U.S. Senate to confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.\u201cAs members of the law enforcement community, we write in recognition of Judge Jackson\u2019s strong, effective and long-standing role in criminal justice issues,\u201d wrote 63 officials from around the country.Jackson would be  the first Black woman named to the nation\u2019s highest court. She was nominated last month by President Joe Biden to fill the seat of Justice Stephen Breyer, who is retiring. She began courting lawmakers last week, meeting privately with Republicans and Democrats. She will meet with more lawmakers Tuesday.It\u2019s unusual for police officials to engage so specifically in politics. Those named in the letter represent the nation\u2019s biggest and busiest police departments and courts. The signers to the letter \u2014 addressed to the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 include former New York Police Department Commissioner Bill Bratton and former NYPD official Ben Tucker, who just retired as highest-ranking Black official in the nation\u2019s largest department.They include current law enforcement officials like Sheriff Peter Koutoujian of Middlesex County, New Jersey; Oakland, California, Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong; Savannah, Georgia, Chief of Police Roy Minter; Beth McCann, district attorney in Denver; and Karl Racine, attorney general for the District of Columbia. Top policing academics also signed the letter.The letter cites Jackson\u2019s history with law enforcement. Growing up in Miami, her uncle was the city\u2019s police chief and another uncle was a sex crimes detective. Her father was an attorney.\u201cSuch direct familiarity with the experiences and challenges of law enforcement enriches her understanding of criminal justice issues,\u201d the letter states.Jackson has also worked as a federal public defender and for the U.S. Sentencing Commission as well as the federal judiciary, and has been praised by defense attorney groups.Senate Democrats concerned about their narrow 50-50 majority \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris breaks the tie \u2014 said the hearings will begin March 21. With a goal of an April confirmation, they are using Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s quick confirmation ahead of the 2020 presidential election as a model for Jackson.Jackson has also won  the support of the Fraternal Order of Police, the largest law enforcement labor organization in the United States, with more than 356,000 members. President Patrick Yoes said the union was \u201creassured\u201d by her record and history and \u201cshould she be confirmed, she would approach her future cases with an open mind and treat issues related to law enforcement fairly and justly.\u201d\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden has decided to ban Russian oil imports, toughening the toll on Russia\u2019s economy in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the matter.The move follows pleas by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to U.S. and Western officials to cut off the imports, which had been a glaring omission in the massive sanctions put in place on Russia over the invasion. Energy exports have kept a steady influx of cash flowing to Russia despite otherwise severe restrictions on its financial sector.Biden was set to announce the move as soon as Tuesday, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter before his remarks. The White House said Biden would announce \u201cactions to continue to hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked and unjustified war on Ukraine.\u201dThe U.S. will be acting alone, but in close consultation with European allies, who are more dependent on Russian energy supplies. European nations have said they plan to reduce their reliance on Russia for their energy needs, but filling the void without crippling their economies will likely take some time. Natural gas from Russia accounts for one-third of Europe\u2019s consumption of the fossil fuel. The U.S. does not import Russian natural gas.Biden had explained his reluctance to impose energy sanctions at the outset of the conflict two weeks ago, saying that he was trying \u201cto limit the pain the American people are feeling at the gas pump.\u201dGas prices have been rising for weeks due to the conflict and in anticipation of potential sanctions on the Russian energy sector. The U.S. national average for a gallon of gasoline soared 45 cents a gallon in the past week and topped $4.06 on Monday, according to auto club AAA.The United States generally imports about 100,000 barrels a day from Russia, only about 5% of Russia\u2019s crude oil exports, according to Rystad Energy. Last year, roughly 8% of U.S. imports of oil and petroleum products came from Russia.Even before the U.S. ban many Western energy companies including ExxonMobil and BP moved to cut ties with the Russia and limit imports. Shell, which purchased a shipment of Russian oil this weekend, apologized for the move on Tuesday amid international criticism and pledged to halt further purchases of Russian energy supplies. Preliminary data from the U.S. Energy Department shows imports of Russian crude dropped to zero in the last week in February.The news of Biden\u2019s decision Tuesday was first reported by Bloomberg.Before the invasion, Russian oil and gas made up more than a third of government revenues. Global energy prices have surged after the invasion and have continued to rise despite coordinated releases of strategic reserves, making Russian exports even more lucrative.As a consequence of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. and international partners have sanctioned Russia\u2019s largest banks, its central bank and finance ministry, and moved to block certain financial institutions from the SWIFT messaging system for international payments.But the rules issued by the Treasury Department allow Russian energy transactions to keep going through non-sanctioned banks that are not based in the U.S. in an effort to minimize any disruptions to the global energy markets.Inflation, at a 40-year peak and fueled in large part by gas prices, has hurt Biden politically with voters heading into the November elections.The sanctions created a possible trade-off for the president between his political interests at home and abroad. By invading Ukraine, Russia has potentially fed into the supply chain problems and inflation that have been a crucial weakness for Biden, who now is trying to strike a balance between penalizing Putin and sparing American voters.Biden specifically highlighted the Russian energy carve-outs as a virtue because they would help to protect U.S. families and businesses from higher prices.\u201cOur sanctions package we specifically designed to allow energy payments to continue,\u201d he said.Restricting the world\u2019s largest exporter of natural gas and second-largest exporter of oil, after Saudi Arabia, could hurt the unity that U.S. officials say is key to confronting Putin.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

She said there had not yet been any indication that the roughly 1,500 Russian soldiers based in Transnistria had changed posture but stressed that it was a concern given what is happening in Ukraine.\u201cIn this region now there is no possibility for us to feel safe,\u201d Sandu said.Although it is neutral militarily and has no plans to try to become a member of NATO, Moldova formally applied to join the European Union just three days ago in a fast-track bid to bolster its ties with the West.\u201cWhile we are facing this unprecedented circumstances, we are firmly committed to our path for European integration,\u201d Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita said. \u201cWe believe that this is an agenda to transform Moldova into a modern, prosperous European state based on the fundamental values of human rights and the rule of law.\u201dBlinken praised Moldova\u2019s European aspirations and said Moldova could count on U.S. support.\u201cMoldova has chosen the path to democracy, a more inclusive economy, a closer relationship with the countries and institutions of Europe, and the United States supports Moldova in those efforts grounded in our respect for the neutrality that\u2019s enshrined in the constitution,\u201d he said.\u201cMoldova is a powerful example of a democracy rising to the moment with vision and with determination,\u201d Blinken said.The U.S. State Department said Sunday that Blinken will meet with Israel\u2019s foreign minister, Yair Lapid, in Riga, Latvia, on Monday during the American\u2019s tour of Baltic nations. Israel\u2019s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, was in Moscow on Saturday for talks with Putin on the war in Ukraine and spoke again with Putin by phone on Sunday.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said that he plans to veto legislation passed Friday that would ban transgender student-athletes from competing in girls sports.Without his support, Utah is unlikely to join the 11 states, all Republican-led, that have recently enacted bans on transgender girls wanting to compete in school sports leagues that correspond with their gender identity.In vowing to veto the bill, Cox directly addressed transgender student-athletes, who he said found themselves the subject of political debate through no fault of their own.\u201cI just want them to know that it\u2019s gonna be okay. We\u2019re gonna work through this,\u201d Cox said.The governor had for months engaged in behind-the-scenes negotiations to broker a compromise between LGBTQ advocates and social conservatives.After throwing his support behind  a proposal to create a first-of-its-kind commission of experts in Utah to make decisions on individual transgender student-athletes aiming to participate, Cox said he was stunned on Friday night as lawmakers advanced and ultimately passed an amended proposal that included an outright ban on transgender student-athletes competing in girls leagues.Legislation sent to Cox after passing through the state Senate and House on Friday bans \u201cbiological males\u201d \u2014 which it defines as \u201can individual\u2019s genetics and anatomy at birth\u201d \u2014 from girls leagues. Supporters said it would ensure fairness and safety for girls and pre-empt cultural shifts they said could lead to a growing number of transgender kids wanting to compete in girls sports in the future.\u201cBoys can run faster, they can jump higher and they can throw farther than girls in the same age bracket,\u201d Republican state Sen. Curt Bramble said.\u201cTo have individuals that are born male compete against naturally born females, it\u2019s an unfair playing field,\u201d he added.The originally proposed \u201cSchool Activity Eligibility Commission\u201d would have been comprised of a mix of experts in sports and transgender healthcare. It ultimately failed to gain buy-in from those opposed to and supportive of a ban.Though they preferred it to an outright ban, LGBTQ advocates worried transgender kids required to appear before the panel would feel targeted. Social conservatives, backed by a much larger contingent of Republican lawmakers, said it didn\u2019t go far enough to protect girls sports.There are no public accusations of a transgender players having competitive advantages in Utah. The Associated Press last year reached out to two dozen lawmakers in the more than 20 states considering similar youth sports measures and found that only a few times has it been an issue among the hundreds of thousands of teenagers who play high school sports.The legislation sent to the governor aims to rebut what commission advocates, including the bill\u2019s sponsor Rep. Kera Birkeland, believed was among their strongest arguments: that courts would likely prevent Utah from enforcing a ban, much like they have in states such as Idaho.The ban that ultimately passed retained sections of the original proposal and designated the commission as a back-up, for a scenario in which courts prohibited Utah from enforcing a ban.Birkeland, who coaches high school basketball when not in the Legislature, said her intention in introducing a transgender youth sports bill for the second year in a row had to do with conversations she had with transgender and cisgender students.Though Utah lawmakers ultimately ended in a similar place, Birkeland\u2019s comments were marked different than those made by lawmakers in states such as Iowa, where one senator framed a ban as a stand against \u201cwokeness\u201d and part of \u201can ongoing culture war.\u201dBirkeland said she was frustrated by the many conversations she had about the politics of her proposed commission, rather than the kids affected.She expects it to face legal challenges but ultimately supported the amended legislation because she said, if the ban gets enjoined by courts, the commission will end up working as intended.Equality Utah, an LGBTQ rights group opposed to state intervention in youth sports, said they were blindsided by the passage of the legislation.\u201cWe have failed our state\u2019s transgender children, who just want to be treated with kindness and respect,\u201d the group said in a statement.In most places, eligibility decisions for transgender kids are made by sports organizations like the Utah High School Athletic Association. Out of the roughly 85,000 student-athletes that play high school sports in the state, four transgender players have gone through the association\u2019s eligibility determination process.Despite those established processes, youth sports have increasingly become a central policy issue in Republican-majority statehouses. Before 2020, no state had enacted a law pertaining to transgender kids participating in youth sports. Since, 11 states have since passed laws banning transgender girls from playing in leagues corresponding with their gender identity \u2014 Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia.In Indiana, lawmakers passed a ban this week, sending it to Gov. Eric Holcomb for final approval.The nature of the bans vary. Some explicitly target transgender girls, who have been the primary subject of debate in most statehouses. Others are broad enough to include college athletics.With two-thirds majorities in both chambers, lawmakers could override a governor\u2019s veto, however with some Republicans opposing the ban, such a scenario is unlikely.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to members of Congress in a videoconference Saturday morning in which he asked for more lethal aid to fend off the invading Russian army and called for additional sanctions \u2015 including a ban on Russian oil and a no-fly zone over Ukrainian airspace.The airspace request came just as Russian President Vladimir Putin issued a threat to any country thinking about implementing a no-fly zone, saying Russia would regard it as active participation in the conflict. Western national security experts fear that such a move would amount to an American declaration of war against Russia, which holds the most nuclear weapons of any country in the world.\u201cNo-fly\u201d means that if Russian aircraft breached Ukrainian airspace, they could be shot down. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has repeatedly rebuffed the suggestion, as has NATO.So Zelenskyy asked for planes in the absence of airspace restrictions.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the Ukrainian leader \u201cmade a desperate plea for Eastern European countries to provide Russian-made planes to Ukraine.\u201d\u201cThese planes are very much needed,\u201d Schumer said, pledging to help facilitate their transfer.Ukrainian fighters are less familiar with American-made planes, and negotiations with European countries to provide military aircraft to Ukraine have fallen apart. Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) indicated that the U.S. could make a deal to compensate Eastern European nations in exchange for those countries supplying Ukraine with \u201cSoviet-style\u201d planes.Zelenskyy\u2019s \u201ctop priority\u201d is \u201cto take back their skies, which are being used by Putin to wage war against cities and murder civilians,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said in a statement. More than 280 members of the House and Senate were present for the call with Zelenskyy, according to Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Foreign Relations Committee.The idea of sending more aid to Ukraine appears to have widespread support in both chambers. \u201cUkraine needs airpower urgently and America should send it. Zelensky\u2019s message is simple: \u2018Close the skies or give us planes,\u2019\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said in a statement.\u201cLet\u2019s be clear-eyed about our options: A No-Fly Zone means sending American pilots into combat against Russian jets and air defenses \u2014 in a battle between nuclear powers that could spiral out of control quickly,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cBut Americans should absolutely send Ukrainians planes, helicopters, and UAVs.\u201dCoons said Zelenskyy \u201cunderscored the urgent need for more military support and humanitarian aid from his Western partners.\u201d Zelenskyy said that a ban on Russian oil imports could be \u201ceven more powerful\u201d than the measures Western countries have taken to block Russian banks from using the SWIFT financial system, according to The New York Times. A bipartisan bill to block Russian oil and gas imports has growing support in the House and Senate, but the Biden administration has pushed back, due to the potential cost to Americans. A Pentagon official said Friday that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of a $350 million aid package approved by the Biden administration last week at the start of the Russian invasion has arrived in Ukraine.The Ukrainian capital of Kyiv is bracing itself for an even more vicious attack from a massive column of Russian forces slowly making its way to the city.Citizens in other cities \u2015 including Mariupol, which aid groups say is running out of food and medicine \u2015 are increasingly desperate to leave.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostOne week after Russia attacked Ukraine, the U.S. announced a new Temporary Protected Status designation for undocumented Ukrainians in America, sheltering them from deportation to their war-torn homeland. \u201cRussia\u2019s premeditated and unprovoked attack on Ukraine has resulted in an ongoing war, senseless violence, and Ukrainians forced to seek refuge in other countries,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in an announcement providing TPS to Ukrainians for 18 months. The designation allows them to work legally in the U.S. \u201cIn these extraordinary times, we will continue to offer our support and protection to Ukrainian nationals in the United States,\u201d Mayorkas said.The decision came after bipartisan calls from lawmakers as well as immigrant rights groups.

According to the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. currently grants TPS protections for people from Venezuela, Syria, Myanmar, Yemen, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Sudan and South Sudan.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPostPresident Joe Biden acknowledged the attacks on abortion care during Tuesday night\u2019s State of the Union address.\u201cThe constitutional right affirmed by Roe v. Wade \u2015 standing precedent for half a century\u2014is under attack as never before,\u201d Biden said, referring to the 1973 Supreme Court case that afforded a person\u2019s right to get an abortion. \u201cIf you want to go forward \u2015 not backwards\u2014we must protect access to health care. Preserve a woman\u2019s right to choose and continue to advance maternal health care for all Americans.\u201dBiden\u2019s remarks were met with cheers and applause from Democratic lawmakers. The chamber looked somewhat bare since most lawmakers were not allowed to bring guests due to COVID-19 restrictions. Despite the president\u2019s strong words in support of Roe, he has still yet to say the word \u201cabortion\u201d in any of his oral remarks including during Tuesday night\u2019s address. To date, Biden has used the word twice as president, but only in written remarks. The first time was 224 days into his presidency, when the White House published a pair of written statements on Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban. The second was more recently, commemorating Women\u2019s History Month in a written statement, where he acknowledged that \u201cthe constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade is facing an unprecedented assault.\u201dBiden has commented on the importance of abortion access in the past, but has always danced around the word itself, opting for other terms like \u201cRoe v. Wade\u201d or \u201creproductive rights.\u201dThe president\u2019s hesitancy to discuss abortion care is disappointing to many lawmakers and advocates who support abortion rights.\u201cWe commend President Biden for alluding to the abortion care crisis we\u2019re in, but it\u2019s not enough,\u201d Morgan Hopkins, interim executive director of campaigns and strategies at All* Above All, a reproductive justice organization, told HuffPost after Biden\u2019s State of the Union address. \u201cLast year, President Biden pledged a \u2018whole of government\u2019 response to Texas\u2019 extreme abortion ban, and six months later, we need to see more concrete steps from the White House to address the crisis we are in,\u201d Hopkins continued. \u201cAnti-abortion state politicians are pushing a record number of restrictions and a looming Supreme Court decision could devastate access in even more states. No one should be forced to travel to another state for abortion care because of political gamesmanship. It\u2019s no game, because people of color working to make ends meet are the ones hurt most. The urgent moment we are in demands action. Abortion justice can\u2019t wait.\u201dMore than 120 abortion rights groups signed a letter earlier this month urging Biden to address the abortion care crisis during his State of the Union address. The organizations pointed out that March 1 marks six months since Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban went into effect. The extreme legislation deputizes private citizens to enforce the ban, effectively decimating the constitutional right to abortion while Roe still stands on the federal level. Biden\u2019s avoidance of the topic is more obvious than ever, now that the landmark Supreme Court case Roe v. Wade, which protects a person\u2019s constitutional right to get an abortion, is expected to be overturned or gutted in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization. The Dobbs case centers on a 2018 Mississippi law that bans abortion at 15 weeks. The law, which was debated in front of the court in December, is a direct contradiction of Roe, which makes it a constitutional right to access abortion until a fetus becomes viable at around 24 weeks. The high court\u2019s decision, expected sometime this spring, could strike down the Mississippi law, meaning Roe would remain intact. But advocates and experts agree that the court\u2019s conservative majority has signaled it will likely uphold the law, either by banning abortion outright or by moving the viability line.\u201cWe know one of the only ways we will win and reclaim access to abortion in this country is if we destigmatize it \u2014 and destigmatizing means we need to say it,\u201d Destiny Lopez, co-president of the abortion rights organization All* Above All, told HuffPost last month. \u201cIt would be incredibly meaningful for people seeking abortion care in this country to hear Biden say the word, to hear him talk about the issue, to acknowledge that he probably knows and loves someone who has had an abortion.\u201dAlthough Biden supports a person\u2019s right to choose \u2015 and is more supportive of reproductive rights than his predecessor by a long shot \u2015 his murky track record on abortion rights still follows him. When Biden joined the Senate in 1973, the year Roe was decided, he voted in favor of allowing states to overturn the Supreme Court decision. For the majority of his career, he also supported the Hyde Amendment, which denies insurance coverage for abortions to people who receive their health care through government-sponsored plans like Medicaid. He changed his stance on the amendment in 2019 after facing criticism from other presidential candidates. While Biden has personally been quiet on the abortion care crisis, his administration has taken steps to address it. The administration rescinded the global gag rule, dropped the Hyde Amendment from Biden\u2019s presidential budget proposal and reversed a Trump-era guideline that barred U.S. health care providers from receiving federal funds if they discussed abortion care with patients.The White House had also signaled its strong support for the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, federal legislation that would have protected abortion access if Roe fell. (The act died in the Senate on Monday.) Additionally, the Department of Justice, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services have all taken steps to protect abortion care under the Biden administration.Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Facing disquiet at home and danger abroad, President Joe Biden will deliver his first State of the Union address at a precipitous moment for the nation, aiming to navigate the country out a pandemic, reboot his stalled domestic agenda and confront Russia\u2019s aggression.The speech Tuesday night had initially been conceived by the White House as an opportunity to highlight the improving coronavirus outlook and rebrand Biden\u2019s domestic policy priorities as a way to lower costs for families grappling with soaring inflation. But it has taken on new significance with last week\u2019s Russian invasion of Ukraine and nuclear saber-rattling by Vladimir Putin.Biden, in his remarks, planned to highlight the bravery of Ukrainian defenders and the resolve of a newly reinvigorated Western alliance that has worked to rearm the Ukrainian military and impose sanctions on Russia to cripple its economy.Biden would speak to \u201cthe importance of the United States as a leader in the world, standing up for values, standing up for global norms, but also the efforts that he has undertaken to mitigate how it will impact people here,\u201d press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.Biden will address a mostly full and mask-optional crowd in the House chamber, one sign of the easing coronavirus threat. But he\u2019ll also speak from within a newly fenced Capitol due to renewed security concerns after last year\u2019s insurrection.Rising energy prices as a result of Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine risk exacerbating inflation in the U.S., which is already at the highest level in 40 years, eating into the earnings of Americans and threatening the country\u2019s economic recovery from the pandemic. And while the geopolitical crisis in Eastern Europe may have helped to cool partisan tensions in Washington, it can\u2019t erase the political and cultural discord that is casting doubt on Biden\u2019s ability to deliver on his pledge to promote national unity.Biden will take the speaker\u2019s rostrum as Americans are frustrated with his performance as president. A February AP-NORC poll found that more people disapproved than approved of how Biden is handling his job as president, 55% to 44%. That\u2019s down from a 60% favorable rating last July.White House officials acknowledge that the mood of the country is \u201csour,\u201d citing the lingering pandemic and inflation as sources of blame. Biden, in his speech, will highlight the progress from a year ago \u2014 with the majority of the country now vaccinated and millions more people at work \u2014 but also acknowledge that the job is not yet done, a recognition of American discontent.Biden aides say they believe the national psyche is a \u201ctrailing indicator\u201d and will improve with time. But time is running short for the president, who needs to salvage his first-term agenda to revive the political fortunes of his party ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections.The president was set to highlight investments in everything from broadband access to bridge construction from November\u2019s $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure law, holding it up as an example of government reaching consensus and delivering change for the American people.He also planned to appeal to lawmakers to reach a compromise on rival competitiveness bills that have passed the House and Senate, both meant to revitalize high-tech American manufacturing and supply chains in the face of growing geopolitical threats from China.The speech comes as progress on many of Biden\u2019s other legislative priorities remains stalled on Capitol Hill, after Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin scuttled the sweeping \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d spending bill that Biden championed last fall.As part of his pitch to voters, Biden will aim to resurrect components of the legislation, but with a new emphasis on how proposals like extending the child tax credit and bringing down child care costs could bring relief to families as prices rise. He was also set to lay out how his climate change proposals would cut costs for lower- and middle-income families and create new jobs.\u201cThe president will absolutely use the word inflation tomorrow and he will talk about inflation in his speech,\u201d said Psaki. But she emphasized that Biden was focused on \u201chow people experience it\u201d rather than looking at it as a statistic.As part of that push, Biden is expected to call for lowering Americans\u2019 health care costs, pitching his plan to authorize Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, as well as an extension of more generous health insurance subsidies now temporarily available through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces where 14.5 million get coverage.While prospects for congressional passage were slim, Biden also was set to appeal for actions around voting rights, gun control and police reform, which have been hamstrung despite his Democratic majority.Biden was expected to showcase what he\u2019s done so far \u2014 for example, acting to crack down on \u201cghost guns,\u201d homemade firearms that lack serial numbers used to trace them and are often purchased without a background check.On voting rights, legislation stalled after Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema denied Senate Democrats the chance to use a workaround that would allow them to pass the bills with their thin 50-50 majority instead of the 60 votes normally required.The voting legislation written by congressional Democrats would bring in the biggest overhaul of the U.S. elections in a generation by striking down hurdles to voting enacted in the name of election security. Republicans say the changes are not aimed at fairness but at giving Democrats an advantage in elections.Biden will also push the Senate to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court. He nominated her last week.Ahead of the speech, the physician\u2019s office for Congress announced that it was lifting the House\u2019s face-covering requirement after the federal government eased its guidelines for mask wearing. Now, mask wearing will be a personal choice in the House chamber, which will be open to all members of Congress, but still no guests.All those who attend will be required to take a COVID-19 test before Biden\u2019s address.Biden aims to use his remarks to highlight progress made against COVID-19 over the last year and to guide the country into a \u201cnew phase\u201d of the virus response that looks more like pre-pandemic life.Seating for Biden\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress, last April, was capped at about 200 people \u2014 about 20% of usual capacity for a presidential presentation. White House aides fretted that a repeat this year would have been a dissonant image from the message the president aims to deliver to the American people.\u201cI think you\u2019re going to see it look much more like a normal State of the Union, \u201d said White House chief of staff Ron Klain. \u201cIt\u2019s going to look like the most normal thing people have seen in Washington in a long time.\u201dWhile masks are coming off, law enforcement officials reinstalled a fence around the Capitol building. There were no specific or credible threats ahead of Biden\u2019s speech, but there had been concerns about trucker convoys heading to Washington to protest pandemic restrictions.___Associated Press writer Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar contributed to this report.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) \u2014 The \u201cstand your ground\u201d self-defense law had been in effect in Florida for more than six years when it became part of the national vocabulary with the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012. When the 17-year-old was fatally shot, Florida was still one of the few states with the law that removes the duty to retreat before using deadly force in the face of danger.Now, upward of 30 states have some form of the law and recent research indicates they are associated with more deaths \u2014 as many as 700 additional firearm killings each year, according to a study published this week in the journal JAMA Network Open.The study found that stand your ground laws in those states could be associated with a national increase of up to 11% in homicide rates per month between 1999 and 2017. The largest increases, between 16% and 33%, were in Southern states including Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana, the study found.\u201cThese findings suggest that adoption of (\u2018stand your ground\u2019) laws across the U.S. was associated with increases in violent deaths, deaths that could potentially have been avoided,\u201d the study\u2019s authors concluded.Advocates for the laws, especially the National Rifle Association, have argued they act as a crime deterrent by ensuring a person can protect themselves and others against a would-be assailant.Florida was first in the nation in 2005 to adopt such a law. It was in force when Martin was fatally shot by self-appointed neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman on Feb. 26, 2012. Martin was Black; Zimmerman had a white father and Hispanic mother.The initial police report said Zimmerman called authorities to report a suspicious person, a guy who, he said, \u201clooks like he\u2019s up to no good.\u201d He followed Martin despite instructions not to do so. In the confrontation that followed, Zimmerman would tell authorities, Martin attacked him, forcing him to use his gun to save himself. Zimmerman was allowed to go free.Martin\u2019s parents questioned Zimmerman\u2019s version of events and eventually the news media and others picked up on the case. Zimmerman was arrested six weeks later after then-Florida Gov. Rick Scott appointed a special prosecutor to the case.Zimmerman\u2019s lawyers opted not to pursue a \u201cstand your ground\u201d claim before trial, which could have resulted in dismissal of murder charges against him and immunity from prosecution. But the law was essentially used as his self-defense argument during the trial, which resulted in his acquittal.Civil rights attorney Ben Crump, who was involved in the Martin case, called the Florida law \u201ca virtual get-out-of-jail-free card that is essentially a license to kill.\u201dToday the battle rages. Gun-rights supporters argue people should not have to try to retreat before defending themselves, said Alan Gottlieb, founder of the Second Amendment Foundation. He pointed to a Florida homeowner who recently shot and killed a man suspected of shooting a police officer as the man tried to break into his house. While that case could have been covered by other self-defense laws, Gottlieb said \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws offer reassurance.\u201cIt\u2019s made a very big difference in self-defense situations,\u201d he said.Three new states passed laws last year removing the duty to retreat: Ohio, Arkansas and North Dakota, where its sponsor said the legislation \u201censures someone will not have to run away prior to protecting themselves or their family.\u201dSix more loosened requirements to carry guns in public by removing the requirement to get a permit, the largest number of any single year. More than 20 states now allow permitless carry.The U.S. Supreme Court also is expected to issue a ruling this session on whether New York\u2019s restrictive gun permitting law violates the Second Amendment right to \u201ckeep and bear arms.\u201d The law\u2019s defenders have said striking it down would lead to more guns on the streets of cities including New York and Los Angeles.Gun control activists say the increasing presence of guns and laws like \u201cstand your ground\u201d are a deadly combination.\u201cLaws like \u2018stand your ground,\u2019 or shoot first laws, give people like Jordan\u2019s killer, my son\u2019s killer, the idea that you can shoot first and ask questions later,\u201d said Rep. Lucy McBath, who entered politics after her son Jordan Davis was slain at a Florida gas station in 2012 by a white man who was angry over the loud music the Black teenager and his friends had been playing in their car.Michael Dunn used the \u201cstand your ground\u201d law in his defense, but was convicted and is serving a life sentence.Likewise, Rovina Billingslea\u2019s family has never been the same. Her cousin Jasmine McAfee, a mother of two, was killed at the hands of an intimate partner near Orlando about four years ago. The shooter was later acquitted under \u201cstand your ground\u201d law, leaving her family reeling.\u201cThere was no justice, no closure, just pain,\u201d Billingslea said.There are new efforts to push back against the measures against a backdrop of rising gun violence: Lawmakers from 19 states have signed on to a new task force aimed at amending or repealing the laws, especially in Georgia, Kansas and Pennsylvania, as well as Florida. The push is backed by Everytown for Gun Safety and Moms Demand Action, whose founder Shannon Watts said they should be called \u201cshoot first laws\u201d since they differ significantly from other self-defense laws already on the books.Since the Martin slaying, Florida has amended its \u201cstand your ground\u201d law to shift the burden of proof from the person claiming self-defense to the prosecutor handling the case.Prosecutors and many police organizations have opposed the laws, contending they can protect criminals and hinder the ability to bring justice to fatal shootings.\u201c\u2018Stand your ground\u2019 laws provide safe harbors for criminals and prevent prosecutors from bringing cases against those who claim self-defense after unnecessarily killing or injuring others,\u201d said David LaBahn, president and CEO of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, in testimony to Congress.In Florida, an ongoing trial in which a retired police captain is accused of murder in the 2014 shooting of a man inside a movie theater hinged initially on a \u201cstand your ground\u201d claim. A judge denied that claim for the former captain, Curtis Reeves, and that was upheld on appeal.Reeves, however, is still claiming self-defense in the killing of Chad Oulson following a dispute over Oulson\u2019s use of a cellphone during movie previews. The shooting happened after Oulson tossed a bag of popcorn at Reeves.So far, that has not qualified as a \u201cstand your ground\u201d defense.\u201cThe evidence will show that\u2019s no reason to kill another person,\u201d said Assistant State Attorney Scott Rosenwasser in an opening statement this week. \u201cThis was an intentional and purposeful shooting.\u201d___Whitehurst reported from Salt Lake City.___This story corrects the name of the journal.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Politics Reporter, HuffPostORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 As Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday, Republicans at CPAC, the annual gathering of the nation\u2019s top conservatives, were mostly silent on the rapidly worsening situation in Eastern Europe.Instead, they wanted to talk about the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cWe are in the process of getting money from the legislature so that if Biden is dropping illegal aliens into Florida from the southern border, I\u2019m rerouting them to Delaware,\u201d said Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom many see as a likely GOP candidate for president in 2024.DeSantis, Thursday\u2019s headliner, didn\u2019t mention Ukraine once during his 20-minute speech, which took place in a huge convention hall as President Joe Biden addressed the nation on sanctions to punish Russian President Vladimir Putin. But DeSantis talked plenty about \u201cwoke\u201d culture and critical race theory, all red meat tossed out liberally to a hungry GOP base.He also complained that Biden \u201chates\u201d Florida, a state he said represents freedom from coronavirus mandates.\u201cHe is always criticizing us, always trying to take potshots at Florida. ... He doesn\u2019t like Florida and he doesn\u2019t like me because we stand up to him,\u201d said DeSantis, who didn\u2019t address his 2024 plans at the convention.When Ukraine did come up, it was usually in comparison to undocumented immigration at the southern U.S. border, where former President Donald Trump directed national resources to building a fence. The focus on the border, even in the face of a more immediate and deadly crisis, shows that Republicans plan to make it an issue in the midterm elections.Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and radio host, told the audience that insecurity at the southern border is a bigger threat to the U.S. than Russian aggression in Europe.\u201cThe southern border is a lot more important than the Ukraine border,\u201d Kirk said, calling Russia\u2019s assault on Ukraine, the most violence that Europe has seen in decades, \u201ca dispute 5,000 miles away in cities we can\u2019t pronounce and places we can\u2019t find on a map.\u201dUtah Attorney General Sean Reyes, speaking on a panel about the \u201cinvasion\u201d at the U.S.-Mexico border, said Biden hasn\u2019t been effective on either that issue or Ukraine.\u201cEverybody is focused on the invasion of Ukraine, as they should be. That\u2019s critical,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as little as the administration has done to deter the invasion in Ukraine, they\u2019ve done even less to deter the invasion of the southern border.\u201d Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, was one of the only major officeholders to address the crisis \u2014 and it was just for a quick moment.\u201cTheir foreign policy is a war zone,\u201d Blackburn said, referring to Democrats. \u201cOh, how we pray for Ukraine and the people of Ukraine.\u201dWhile Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sidestepped Ukraine altogether, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) blasted Biden on the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan and blamed the president for projecting weakness on Russia.\u201cNow you look at what\u2019s happening in Ukraine. Talk about the weakness of Joe Biden,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cHe comes to office and what does he do? He shuts down American energy production and greenlights Russian energy production. ... Is it any wonder that Vladimir Putin feels emboldened to do whatever the heck it is he wants to do?\u201d Other Republicans in Congress have piled on Biden for supposedly setting the stage for Russia\u2019s actions with his domestic energy measures and his purported \u201cweakness\u201d on the world stage.On Thursday, Biden called Putin \u201cthe aggressor\u201d in the war and pledged measures to punish Russia economically. The invasion of Ukraine killed at least 137 people in its first day. Russian forces also captured Chernobyl, the site of the deadly 1986 nuclear disaster.Trump, who\u2019s speaking at CPAC on Saturday, blamed Putin\u2019s attack on supposed U.S. election fraud in 2020 \u2014 one falsehood on top of another. He also praised Putin as \u201csmart\u201d and a \u201cgenius\u201d in comments this week.\u201cHe sees the weakness and stupidity of this administration,\u201d Trump said of Putin on Fox News Wednesday. \u201cIt happened because of a rigged election.\u201dThe conference did dedicate a panel Thursday to foreign policy. It featured K.T. McFarland, who served as deputy national security adviser in the early months of the Trump administration.McFarland said she was skeptical that Biden\u2019s Russia sanctions weren\u2019t just a \u201cslap on the wrist\u201d and that he is doing enough to advance U.S. oil and gas interests.\u201cForty-eight hours from now will determine what happens in Ukraine,\u201d McFarland said.CPAC continues through Sunday.Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Eddie Rodriguez (D), a mainstream progressive with a decidedly more cautious style.Rodriguez has blasted Casar for his support of a 2019 law decriminalizing outdoor homeless encampments in the city of Austin, and for efforts to reduce Austin\u2019s police department funding a year later.In both cases, Casar\u2019s agenda was overtaken by outside political forces that reflected a broader backlash to left-wing social policies in Democratic cities.Texas\u2019 March 1 primary, which will lead to a runoff if no candidate gets an outright majority, is a chance for progressives to demonstrate that Casar\u2019s brand of activist lawmaking can still carry the day at the ballot box.If Ocasio-Cortez \u2015 a former bartender who first ran with little cash and even less experience in elected office \u2015 reflected a less seasoned iteration of the current wave of progressive primary challengers, Casar\u2019s relative strength speaks to how the new movement of left-wing gate-crashers has matured over time.With internal polling that showed him with a 25-point lead in December and a consistent fundraising edge, Casar, a practiced local lawmaker, has managed to obtain an air of inevitability that was once the exclusive domain of establishment Democrats in races of this kind. His odds of victory have helped him rack up endorsements from the likes of U.S. Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee and Sylvia Garcia \u2015 both Texas Democrats, but neither a tribune of the far left \u2015 and taken some of the air out of moderate insiders\u2019 efforts to stop him.\u201cHe definitely seems to have some wind at his back right now,\u201d said Ed Espinoza, executive director of Progress Texas, a liberal group that is neutral in the race. What perhaps distinguishes Casar most from some of his less experienced ideological allies is that he avoids potential rhetorical traps with the agility of a ballet dancer. Would Casar call on Spotify to expel controversial podcast host Joe Rogan, an Austin resident? Casar wouldn\u2019t say. Instead, he praised Neil Young and other artists for exiting the platform in protest, and then pivoted to a brief soliloquy on how Austin \u201cdoesn\u2019t align with values of vaccine misinformation or racial injustice.\u201dWould Casar be a member of the \u201cSquad\u201d if elected? Essentially, yes, but Casar joked that it wasn\u2019t up to him. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you get a membership card, or if that\u2019s bestowed upon you by others,\u201d he said.\u201cIt was very quickly clear that [Casar] was just a rock star.\u201dWould Casar have joined Ocasio-Cortez in voting against the bipartisan infrastructure bill? He couldn\u2019t say for certain, noting that it was hard to predict that assurances of a vote on Build Back Better legislation would not come to fruition. \u201cWith 20/20 hindsight, it looks like she made the right call,\u201d he offered.Does Casar support imposing tougher conditions on U.S. aid to Israel? He referred HuffPost to a letter he sent last month to a prominent Austin rabbi. In the letter, Casar wrote that he supports \u201crestricting [U.S.] aid from being used in a manner that violates basic rights,\u201d but also that \u201cupdates should not be imposed in a discriminatory manner against any people or nation.\u201d How that would apply to Israel is unclear.Casar\u2019s decision to distance himself from the far left\u2019s more radical positions on U.S.-Israel policy, including the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, reflects the activist-lawmaker\u2019s canny political instincts.The move cost him the endorsement of his longtime allies in the Austin chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America. But it likely also spared him from a multimillion-dollar assault by groups like Democratic Majority for Israel, which has not endorsed any candidate in Casar\u2019s race.\u201cHe certainly does know how to manage tradeoffs, but he picks good spots,\u201d Espinoza said.Casar\u2019s political education began in earnest in 2014, when he was elected to the Austin City Council. At age 24, he was the youngest person ever elected to the local governing body.Previously, Casar was policy director of the Workers Defense Project, a nonprofit that advocates for Austin\u2019s immigrant construction workers. With the backing of major labor unions, Casar promised that on the council he would continue pushing for higher standards for Austin\u2019s most vulnerable workers and take the fight to unscrupulous contractors.Sure enough, gains for workers are among Casar\u2019s lasting policy achievements on the city council. He played a role in the city extending its \u201cliving wage\u201d law to employees of subcontractors, increasing city employee pay to $15 an hour, and adopting a paid sick leave requirement for all private-sector employees (albeit one that the Texas Supreme Court prevented from taking effect in June 2020).That work put him on the radar of national progressive leaders like New York City Comptroller Brad Lander (D). A city councilman when Casar was elected, Lander began coordinating closely with him as part of Local Progress, a forum for left-leaning local elected officials.At the same time, the city\u2019s business community did not initially see him as an enemy. The Austin Young Chamber of Commerce, a business group, honored Casar as an \u201cinspiring leader\u201d in 2015.\u201cIt was very quickly clear that he was just a rock star,\u201d Lander recalled during a trip to Texas in support of progressive candidates in mid-February.Just a few years ago, Eddie Rodriguez would likely have been one of the more progressive Democrats in the House. Among other stances, he supports Medicare for All, refuses corporate PAC donations, and is passionate about expanding affordable housing.Asked why he is running for Congress after 19 years representing Austin in the state legislature, Rodriguez, a real estate title insurance executive raised in the Rio Grande Valley, said he wants to help working families get ahead and beat back Republican attacks on voting and abortion rights.\u201cMy parents instilled in me the American dream \u2015 \u2018if you work hard, you can do better than we did,\u2019\u201d he said, noting that he was the first person in his family to obtain a college degree. \u201cThat dream\u2019s faded away for a lot of people, especially working folks.\u201dRodriguez, who boasts endorsements of his own from members of Texas\u2019 congressional delegation, has cast some votes as a state lawmaker that have given progressive critics an opening in the current primary. Along with virtually all of his colleagues, Rodriguez voted in 2007 to continue state tax breaks for oil and gas companies. And as noted in a new direct-mail item funded by the Working Families Party, which is backing Casar, Rodriguez has been a frequent recipient of donations from the fossil fuel industry during his tenure in the state House.The Sierra Club nonetheless consistently gives Rodriguez top marks for his overall voting record. The environmental group gave Rodriguez an 86% score on its legislative scorecard in the 2021 session.The pressures of a race in which he must occupy the clear moderate lane have also prompted Rodriguez to embrace his centrist side. While he is a member of the progressive caucus in Texas\u2019 state legislature, Rodriguez would not commit to joining the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition has endorsed him. But as is the case with so many mainstream liberals of an older vintage and the newer cohort of leftists, Rodriguez\u2019s differences with Casar are often tactical in nature.Rodriguez, 50, prefers behind-the-scenes politicking and incremental wins to movement-driven organizing and aim-for-the-skies policy ideas. He recalls with pride how he prevailed on the legislature\u2019s reigning Republicans to expand Texas\u2019 free school breakfast program for poor students, and shepherded state-level legislation that gave Austin greater flexibility to address its affordable housing crisis. \u201cYou can\u2019t just make the perfect the enemy of the good.\u201d\u201cTo be called a progressive, you have to make progress,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just make the perfect the enemy of the good.\u201dRodriguez\u2019s overall critique of Casar \u2015 that his all-or-nothing approach to policymaking has undermined meaningful reform \u2015 comes into sharper relief in two specific cases.Casar was a key player in the Austin City Council\u2019s June 2019 decision to end the city\u2019s prohibition on camping in undesignated areas. The goal of the legislation was to stop criminalizing Austin\u2019s growing population of homeless people and get them the help they needed. But following the move, homeless encampments began popping up in greater numbers in Austin\u2019s parks, thoroughfares and other public spaces, sparking a massive political backlash. A local Republican Party official spearheaded a ballot initiative to reinstate the camping ban. And despite the city\u2019s Democratic slant, 57% of Austin\u2019s voters approved the referendum in May.Rodriguez was one of the Democrats who voted for the reinstatement, telling HuffPost that \u201cthere are better solutions.\u201d Rodriguez made Casar\u2019s support for lifting the ban on homeless camping the subject of a direct-mail attack that also blamed Casar for \u201cfail[ing] to build affordable housing.\u201dBut Casar contends that the chaotic scenes of homeless encampments on the city\u2019s streets created political will to build supportive housing that had not existed previously. \u201cIt is worth it if a couple years from now, we could look back and say, \u2018There was a lot of political pain, but at the end of the day, we pulled thousands of real human beings out of real pain and out of the streets and into homes,\u2019\u201d he said.Rodriguez has also seized on Casar\u2019s role in championing cuts to Austin\u2019s police department budget. In August 2020, Casar touted the city council\u2019s decision to reduce the police department budget by about one-third and spend it instead on things like an emergency mental health hotline. \u201cWe did it!\u201d he declared on Twitter. Critics blame some of the funding cuts for a shortage of personnel amid a historic rise in homicides in the city.In June, the Texas state legislature passed a bill that would effectively confiscate funding from large cities that reduce law-enforcement funding. The following month, Austin responded by restoring most of the 2020 funding cuts.Casar still defends the funding cut, characterizing it as a shift in resources that freed up money for the emergency hotline and much-needed shelters for families fleeing domestic violence.\u201cWe were told time and time again, \u2018Don\u2019t make things better, because the legislature will come and make things worse,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd instead, what we decided to do was go and try to make as many things better as we could.\u201d Lurking behind some of the criticism lobbed at Casar is a sense that left-wing Democrats like him have made it harder for the party as a whole to compete in Texas. That\u2019s especially true, these critics contend, at a time when Democrats are at pains to thwart Republican advances among Latino voters in South Texas.\u201cI am concerned that we\u2019ll have long-term damage to the Democratic Party in Texas\u201d if the party keeps nominating candidates like Casar, said Rebecca Viagr\u00e1n, a former San Antonio city councilwoman running against Casar and Rodriguez. Viagr\u00e1n is the only major female candidate on the primary ballot in Texas\u2019 35th District, a status often described as an advantage in a Democratic primary. With less than $65,000 in cash on hand as of Feb. 9, however, she is very much a long shot for the Austin-centric seat.But she speaks for a contingent of mainstream Democrats who are struggling to distinguish themselves to voters from a new generation of young democratic socialists who punch above their weight in the media and popular culture.\u201cWe need to have more people who can be progressive, but also talk to my neighbor down the street, who\u2019s a Vietnam veteran who agrees that we need to increase the minimum wage, and women should have their own rights, but doesn\u2019t believe that we should defund the police or have homeless encampments everywhere in the city,\u201d Viagr\u00e1n said.In Texas\u2019 35th, there may be enough voters who fit the profile Viagr\u00e1n described to hand her, or Rodriguez, a surprise win \u2015 or at least necessitate a runoff. It\u2019s unclear how accurate polling will be if the current pattern of anemic turnout holds.At an early voting site in East Austin, Maxine Jackson, a church secretary, could not recall the name of the person she voted for, but she knew it definitely wasn\u2019t Casar.\u201cGreg is giving me the impression that he wants to let them stay homeless under the tents,\u201d she said.Why then does polling suggest that Casar is the unrivaled front-runner? \u201cMoney talks,\u201d said Gonzalo Barrientos, a trailblazing former state lawmaker who is backing Rodriguez. \u201cCasar is probably getting a lot of money from New York and California \u2015 from socialist Democrats.\u201d\u201cWe need to have more people who can be progressive, but also talk to my neighbor down the street.\u201dAnother answer might be that Rodriguez has failed to sell donors on a path to victory. After receiving just one-third of the vote in a contentious state Senate primary in July 2020, Rodriguez dropped out rather than stand for the runoff. (Rodriguez promised to HuffPost that if he qualifies this time, he will proceed to the runoff.)And in addition to Casar\u2019s divorce with the Austin DSA, he\u2019s taken other steps to inoculate himself from the ire of the local pro-Israel community, which might ordinarily have stepped in more heavily on Rodriguez\u2019s behalf. The Saturday after the hostage crisis at a synagogue in Colleyville, Texas, Casar joined O\u2019Rourke \u2015 now a gubernatorial candidate \u2015 and other elected officials at sabbath services at a synagogue in Austin as a show of solidarity.In some ways though, Rodriguez, Viagr\u00e1n and Democrats sympathetic to them are victims of their own success in painting individual elections as referendums on the direction of the party.When moderate and mainstream liberal Democrats crowed about election results in New York City, Cleveland, Seattle, Minneapolis and Buffalo in 2021 \u2015 declaring their critiques of the activist left had been vindicated \u2015 leftists protested that there were confounding factors that complicated the takeaways from each of those races. They also singled out Austin as a bright spot, since the city\u2019s voters rejected a ballot initiative in November that would have required the city to hire hundreds more police officers.\u201cThe message of police accountability and oversight resonates,\u201d Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of the progressive group Our Revolution, told HuffPost in November. \u201cThat\u2019s clear.\u201dNow, as a left-wing candidate is poised to prevail in a contested primary, the Democrats touting previous primary wins lack the credibility \u2015 or the tools \u2015 to push back on the progressive narrative. Progressives, however, are eager to temper expectations.Asked whether a win for Casar would show that left-wing positions on policing and homelessness are not as much of a liability as previously thought, Lander, the NYC comptroller, would not answer directly.\u201cGreg\u2019s win would show that there can be more AOCs,\u201d he said.Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost"}
{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostDemocrat Keturah Herron won a special election for a vacant Kentucky state legislative seat on Tuesday, a victory that will make her the first-ever openly LGBTQ member of the state House of Representatives.Herron, an activist and former policy strategist at the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, played an instrumental role in the Kentucky state legislature\u2019s passage of a law that limited the use of no-knock warrants in the wake of the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman whom Louisville police shot and killed after raiding her home in March 2020.Herron, who is Black, has also advocated for and helped draft other potential changes to state law, including legislation that would permanently restore voting rights to Kentuckians convicted of felony convictions. Herron easily defeated Republican opponent Judy Martin Stallard in the race for the Louisville state legislative seat, which opened when longtime state Rep. Reginald Meeks (D) retired last year. She will serve as part of the Democratic minority in the state House, and Republicans will hold a 75-25 majority once she is sworn into office.She does, however, boast experience working with GOP lawmakers in the Kentucky legislature: \u201cBreonna\u2019s law,\u201d as the bill banning no-knock warrants is known, passed with bipartisan support last year. Herron, the ACLU and other advocacy groups have also won backing from leading Republicans for the CROWN Act, a bill that would bar businesses and schools from discriminating against Black Kentuckians based on their hairstyles. Legislation to permanently restore voting rights to people with felony convictions, which Herron has pushed for in recent legislative sessions, also has support from Republicans.Tuesday\u2019s victory will make Herron the third Black woman currently serving in the Kentucky state legislature. Prior to Democratic state Rep. Attica Scott\u2019s 2016 victory, it had been nearly two decades since a Black woman held a Kentucky state legislative seat. Scott is now running in a Democratic primary to replace retiring U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth (D).Herron\u2019s win comes just a week after Kentucky\u2019s GOP-controlled state Senate approved legislation that would ban transgender girls from participating in school sports that match their gender identity, part of a nationwide Republican push that has accelerated in the last two years.Former state Sen. Ernesto Scorsone (D) became the first openly gay state legislator in Kentucky history in 2003, when he came out while in office. Scorsone left the legislature in 2008 after he was appointed to a judgeship.Lexington, the state\u2019s second-largest city, elected Jim Gray (D) as mayor in 2010, making it one of the nation\u2019s largest cities to elect an openly gay mayor at the time. Gray ran for U.S. Senate in 2016 and became the first openly gay candidate to win a major party nomination for a statewide office in Kentucky, but he lost to Sen. Rand Paul in the general election. Gray also ran for Congress in 2018, a race that would have made him Kentucky\u2019s first openly gay member of Congress, but he lost in the Democratic primary.Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lawyers for Donald Trump\u2019s longtime finance chief, Allen Weisselberg, are asking a judge to throw out tax fraud charges against him, arguing New York prosecutors targeted him as punishment because he wouldn\u2019t flip on the former president.In court papers filed Tuesday, Weisselberg\u2019s lawyer said the Trump Organization\u2019s CFO is \u201ccollateral damage\u201d in a \u201csingular crusade\u201d by Democratic prosecutors to have him implicate and help put the Republican ex-president behind bars.\u201cMr. Weisselberg\u2019s unequal and unfair treatment is the consequence of his proximity to Donald J. Trump, and his rejection of (prosecutors\u2019) demand that he cooperate with (their) investigation targeting Mr. Trump and his businesses,\u201d Weisselberg lawyers wrote.Weisselberg was arrested last July on charges he collected more than $1.7 million in off-the-books compensation, including apartment rent, car payments and school tuition. Trump\u2019s company is also charged in the case, which prosecutors have described as a \u201csweeping and audacious\u201d tax fraud scheme.Weisselberg and the Trump Organization have pleaded not guilty. Lawyers for the company also sought Tuesday to have the company\u2019s charges dismissed.Weisselberg, 74, is the only Trump executive charged in the yearslong criminal investigation started by former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and now overseen by his successor, Alvin Bragg. Several other Trump executives have been granted immunity to testify before a grand jury in the case.A message seeking comment was left Wednesday with the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office. Prosecutors are expected to respond to Weisselberg\u2019s motion to dismiss in a court filing in the coming weeks.Judge Juan Manuel Merchan has given both sides until spring to file motions and responses and indicated he\u2019ll decide on them at a July hearing, the next time Weisselberg is due in court. Merchan has said he\u2019ll likely schedule a trial for the end of August or beginning of September.Weisselberg\u2019s lawyers, who include Mary Mulligan, Bryan Skarlatos and Rita Glavin, have also asked Merchan to consider throwing out part of the indictment and suppressing statements made while in custody on July 1, if the judge doesn\u2019t agree to dismiss the case entirely. Glavin also represents former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Weisselberg\u2019s lawyers argued that some charges against him are outside the statute of limitations or are otherwise legally deficient. They said Weisselberg\u2019s statements to investigators during the eight hours he was in custody after his arrest shouldn\u2019t be admissible because they were taken in violation of his rights.D.A.\u2019s office investigators struck up conversations with Weisselberg that were \u201claser-focused on issues relevant to the indictment,\u201d even though they were aware that Weisselberg was represented by counsel that wasn\u2019t present at the time, the lawyers wrote. The conversations constituted an interrogation and violated Weisselberg\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, they said.Trump has not been charged with any wrongdoing, but prosecutors noted he signed some of the checks at the center of Weisselberg\u2019s case, which they said stemmed from a 15-year scheme \u201corchestrated by the most senior executives\u201d at the Trump Organization.A judge last week ruled that Trump and his two eldest children, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr. must answer questions under oath in a parallel civil investigation into his business practices being run by New York Attorney General Letitia James.James, a Democrat, said her investigation has uncovered evidence Trump\u2019s company, the Trump Organization, used \u201cfraudulent or misleading\u201d valuations of assets like golf courses and skyscrapers to get loans and tax benefits. Trump\u2019s longtime accounting firm recently dumped him after warning him not to rely on years of financial statements it prepared based on his company\u2019s valuations, given questions about their accuracy.Although James\u2019 civil investigation is separate from the criminal investigation, her office has been involved in both, dispatching several lawyers to work side-by-side with prosecutors from the Manhattan D.A.\u2019s office. It was evidence uncovered in James\u2019 civil investigation that led to criminal charges against Weisselberg.In a statement last week, Trump said he believed Weisselberg was innocent and that the charges against the man he described as \u201ca 74-year-old long-term and wonderful employee\u201d were overblown.The charge \u201cis that he did not pay taxes on a company car or a company apartment (Do others pay such a tax? Did Cy Vance pay a tax on his car?), and a charge having to do with my paying for the education of his grandchildren,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMurderers all over the city and they are worried about me helping with young children\u2019s education?\u201dIn a separate ruling, a judge last week ordered Weisselberg to sit for a limited deposition in Washington, D.C., Attorney General Karl Racine\u2019s lawsuit accusing Trump\u2019s inaugural committee of grossly overspending at Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania Avenue hotel to enrich Trump\u2019s family.___Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak and send confidential tips by visiting https://www.ap.org/tips/\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Foreign Affairs Reporter, HuffPostAfter Russian President Vladimir Putin declared that he wants to redraw Europe\u2019s borders by dismembering Ukraine, Western officials said Monday that they believe Russia is violating international law and are planning a strong response.The European Union and its partners \u201cwill react with unity, firmness and with determination in solidarity with Ukraine,\u201d European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen tweeted, accusing Moscow of derailing negotiations between Ukraine\u2019s government in Kiev and pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country. Putin said Monday that the separatist-controlled regions should now be treated as independent of Ukraine. He is widely expected to send Russian forces into the area \u2015 known as the Donbas \u2015 in the coming days and has amassed tens of thousands troops near other parts of Ukraine. In a statement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the Biden administration will bar Americans from supporting the separatists and sanction people who do. She noted that the U.S. is separately considering major sanctions on Russia if it ramps up its interference in Ukraine, where it has been supporting the insurgency since 2014. A White House official later told reporters the administration would announce additional actions on Tuesday. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said her nation would also unveil new sanctions that day.National security experts worry that intense fighting will soon break out, and Western intelligence suggests Putin will claim that the Ukrainians have initiated it.Alar Karis, the president of Estonia, tweeted, \u201cMoscow is not serious about diplomacy but is looking for casus belli,\u201d referring to a justification for war.\u201cMoscow continues to fuel the conflict in eastern Ukraine by providing financial and military support to the separatists.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Tom Holland might be without his Spider-Man suit in \u201cUncharted,\u201d but his latest action-adventure is still doing good business at the North American box office.The video game adaptation starring Holland and Mark Wahlberg is on its way to earning $51 million over the long Presidents Day weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. Sony Pictures estimated its Friday through Sunday grosses will be $44.2 million, putting it at No. 1.Though not a superhero payday, it\u2019s enough for the industry to breathe a sigh of relief as it\u2019s the biggest opening weekend since \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home.\u201d The weekend\u2019s other new opener, \u201cDog\u201d found a modest audience too and landed in second place.The unpredictability of pandemic-era audiences made \u201cUncharted\u201d a bit of a wild card, and the poor reviews from critics had some going into the weekend with cautious optimism. The Ruben Fleischer-directed pic, based on a PlayStation game, opened on 4,275 screens.\u201cThis result is yet another extraordinary testament to the appetite for the theatrical experience that Sony Pictures bet on,\u201d said Josh Greenstein, the president of Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group, in a statement.Sony also released the megahit \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d exclusively in theaters late last year. That Holland-led enterprise has now earned $771.7 million in North America and is the No. 3 domestic release of all time.\u201cTom Holland is a megastar regardless of whether he\u2019s Peter Parker or Nathan Drake,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cFor many of the actors who have portrayed superheroes, breaking out of that role and having big box office success outside of that is a tough go.\u201d\u201cUncharted\u201d does have a ways to go to make up its $120 million production budget, which will likely be heavily offset by overseas earnings. Its global total has already surpassed $100 million and, unlike \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d \u201cUncharted\u201d will also get the benefit of a release in China, beginning March 14.Channing Tatum\u2019s \u201cDog,\u201d which he co-directed (with his longtime producing partner Reid Carolin) and stars in, also opened on 3,677 screens this weekend. United Artists estimates that it\u2019ll earn $15.1 million for the weekend and $18.1 million including Monday. Tatum plays an Army ranger tasked with driving a traumatized military dog from Oregon to Arizona for her handler\u2019s funeral in the film, which was received well by critics and audiences. Plus, it only cost around $15 million to make.The PostTrak survey shows that the opening weekend audience for \u201cDog\u201d was 53% over age 35 and 54% was female.\u201cTo have two movies do really solid business makes it feel like 2019 all over again,\u201d Dergarabedian said.In its second weekend Kenneth Branagh\u2019s \u201cDeath on the Nile\u201d landed in fourth place with $6.3 million, behind \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d while \u201cJackass Forever\u201d took fifth place with $5.2 million.According to Dergarabedian, the momentum from this weekend should be the \u201cperfect leadup\u201d to the already highly anticipated release of Warner Bros. \u201cThe Batman\u201d on March 4.\u201cThink about all the people in the movie theater this weekend being exposed to trailers,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThis is great news for \u2018The Batman.\u2019\u201dBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court is giving the Biden administration a quick hearing on its effort to scrap a Trump-era border policy that makes asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for hearings in U.S. immigration court.The justices agreed Friday to hear the administration\u2019s appeal of lower court rulings that forced it to reinstate the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy that former President Donald Trump introduced in 2019. Arguments will take place in April, with a decision expected by late June.President Joe Biden suspended the program, formally called Migrant Protection Protocols, on his first day in office and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas ended it in June 2021.But after the Republican-led states of Missouri and Texas sued over Biden\u2019s action, a federal judge ordered the policy put back in place, and a three-judge appeals court panel agreed. The district judge and two of the three appellate judges are Trump appointees.Mayorkas has acknowledged that the \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy likely contributed to a drop in illegal border crossings in 2019, but said the reduction came with \u201csubstantial and unjustifiable human costs\u201d to asylum-seekers who were exposed to violence while waiting in Mexico.The program has resumed, but slowly. Since its restart in December, 572 people had been returned to Mexico through Feb. 13, according to the United Nations migration agency.Both the Trump and Biden administrations have used a separate authority, aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19, to expel more than 1.5 million migrants since March 2020 without giving them an opportunity to claim asylum.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The newspaper said that decision is in line with virus safety protocols on television sets established by Los Angeles County officials.Variety confirmed the reports later Thursday evening. The ceremony is scheduled for March 27 in Los Angeles.The academy will invite only 2,500 people to the event at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, which typically seats more than 3,300, in an effort to keep guests safe, although many people won\u2019t be required to wear face coverings. Masks may be required in some areas where it would be harder for guests to maintain safer distances.The news came a week after The Hollywood Reporter said vaccination would not be required to attend the Oscars, a revelation that prompted fierce outcry from some celebrities. Seth MacFarlane, who hosted the ceremony in 2013, said the report, if true, would be a \u201ccolossal abdication of responsible management.\u201dCases of COVID-19 have been falling significantly across California after a massive wave driven by the omicron variant of the virus, and the state lifted its indoor public mask mandate on Tuesday, saying it would also reevaluate school mask requirements at the end of the month. Local governments, though, could set stricter standards, and Los Angeles County still requires masks for indoor public settings.Disneyland also said fully vaccinated guests would not be required to wear masks, and other events, like the Coachella music festival, dropped its COVID-19 safety protocols and said it would welcome the unvaccinated when it returns in April.The New York Times said the academy would directly contact invitees and presenters to explain the safety requirements.Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden on Friday signed a bipartisan bill to extend government funding for three weeks to give Congress more time to reach an overdue deal financing federal agencies through the rest of the fiscal year, the White House announced.The Senate approved the measure Thursday by a bipartisan 65-27 vote, five more than the 60 votes needed, after the House easily approved the legislation last week. Each party had concluded that an election-year shutdown would be politically damaging, especially during a pandemic and a confrontation with Russia over its possible invasion of Ukraine.Both parties hope the short-term measure will be the last one needed as negotiators craft compromise bills financing agencies through Sept. 30. Since the government\u2019s budget year began last Oct. 1, federal agencies have functioned at spending levels approved in the waning weeks of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency.The new spending bills will be bipartisan compromises but will let Biden and Democrats controlling Congress put more of a stamp on spending priorities.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 A U.S. Embassy spokesman told a Russian news agency Thursday that Russia has expelled the deputy chief of of the U.S. mission in Moscow.No details were given of why Bart Gorman was expelled. The State Department confirmed the expulsion, calling it unprovoked.The move comes amid heightened tensions between Russia and the U.S., fueled by fears that Moscow plans to invade Ukraine.Spokesman Jason Rebholz told the state RIA Novosti news agency that Gorman was second in command in the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and had an open visa. He spent less than three years in Moscow, the report said.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP\u2019s earlier story follows below.KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 NATO allies accused Russia on Thursday of misleading the world with \u201cdisinformation\u201d by saying it was returning some troops to bases, charging that Moscow has instead added as many as 7,000 more troops near its tense border with Ukraine.Tensions also spiked Thursday along the line that separates Ukrainian forces from Russia-backed separatists in the country\u2019s east, with the parties accusing each other of intensive shelling. Western fears resurged that Russia is planning to invade Ukraine, after weeks of East-West tensions that have threatened Europe\u2019s post-Cold War balance of power.The U.S. and its NATO partners said they had seen no sign yet of Russia\u2019s promised troop withdrawal.\u201cWe\u2019ve seen some of those troops inch closer to that border. We see them fly in more combat and support aircraft,\u201d U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at NATO headquarters in Brussels. \u201cWe see them sharpen their readiness in the Black Sea. We even see them stocking up their blood supplies. You don\u2019t do these sort of things for no reason, and you certainly don\u2019t do them if you\u2019re getting ready to pack up and go home.\u201dRussia held out an offer of diplomacy, handing the U.S. a response Thursday to offers to engage in talks on limiting missile deployments in Europe, restrictions on military drills and other confidence-building measures.As U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken headed to New York for the U.N. Security Council meeting and then Germany for the Munich Security Conference, Russia delivered its long-awaited responses to U.S. proposals on Ukraine and broader European security. A senior State Department official said the Russians had presented its response to U.S. Ambassador to Russia John Sullivan in Moscow.Positive signals from Moscow lowered the temperature in the crisis earlier in the week but the heat was back up Thursday, where Western powers estimating Russia has 150,000-plus troops massed outside Ukraine\u2019s borders.\u201cWe have seen the opposite of some of the statements. We have seen an increase of troops over the last 48 hours, up to 7,000,\u201d said British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace ahead of a meeting Thursday of the western alliance in Brussels.That squared with what a U.S. administration official said a day earlier. The top EU official said similar.British Armed Forces Minister James Heappey even called Russia\u2019s claim to be withdrawing troops \u201cdisinformation.\u201d Russia accuses the West of the same.Russia has \u201cenough troops, enough capabilities, to launch a full-fledged invasion of Ukraine with very little or no warning time,\u201d NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said. \u201cThe fact that you\u2019re putting a battle tank on a train and moving it in some direction doesn\u2019t prove a withdrawal of troops.\u201dWhile no attack materialized Wednesday as some had feared, Western officials warned the threat of invasion remains high and vowed to counter it.\u201cThe consequences of this mass buildup \u2013 nearly 60% of Russia\u2019s land combat forces on the border of a sovereign nation \u2013 will get you the opposite effect,\u201d Wallace said.\u201cWe are deadly serious,\u201d he added, \u201cand we\u2019re going to face the threat that is currently being posed.\u201dMoscow said several times this week that some forces are pulling back to their bases, but it gave few details that would allow for an independent assessment of the scope and direction of the troop movement.Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj.-Gen. Igor Konashenkov offered a bit more detail Thursday, saying that Russian tank and infantry units that took part in drills in the Kursk and Bryansk regions neighboring Ukraine were pulling back to their permanent bases in Nizhny Novgorod region. He said that some of those units already had arrived at their bases after a 700-kilometer journey east.Troops deployed for exercises in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, have moved back to Chechnya and Dagestan in Russia\u2019s North Caucasus, he noted. He also said Russian troops involved in drills Belarus will also move back to their garrisons after war games there wrap up on Sunday. Konashenkov didn\u2019t mention the numbers of troops that were deployed and didn\u2019t say how many of them returned.NATO, meanwhile, has moved troops and military equipment into Eastern Europe in a display of resolve of meant to deter any Russian aggression and underline its intent to defend NATO\u2019s eastern members, in the unlikely event that they too become a target.The U.S. has started deploying 5,000 troops to Poland and Romania. Another 8,500 are on standby, and some U.S. troops are expected to move toward Bulgaria. Britain is sending hundreds of soldiers to Poland, offering more warships and planes, and doubling its personnel in Estonia. Germany, the Netherlands and Norway are sending additional troops to Lithuania. Denmark and Spain are providing jets for air policing in the Baltic Sea region.Even if an attack doesn\u2019t materialize, the sustained Russian pressure on Ukraine has further hobbled its shaky economy and left an entire nation under constant strain \u2014 a situation that could last indefinitely.Ukraine already has been the stage of fighting for eight years, and tensions soared again Thursday in the conflict in the country\u2019s east, where Russian-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian troops since 2014.Separatist authorities in the Luhansk region reported an increase in Ukrainian shelling along the tense line of contact, describing it as a \u201clarge-scale provocation.\u201d Separatist official Rodion Miroshnik said rebel forces returned fire.Ukraine disputed the claim, saying that separatists had shelled its forces, but they didn\u2019t fire back. The Ukrainian military command charged that shells hit a kindergarten building in Stanytsia Luhanska, wounding two civilians, and cut power supply to half of the town.An observer mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is expected to offer its assessment of the situation later Thursday.Ukrainain President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tweeted that \u201cthe shelling of a kindergarten in Stanytsia Luhanska by pro-Russian forces is a big provocation,\u201d adding that the OSCE monitoring activities are \u201can additional deterrent.\u201dAsked about the flare-up of hostilities in the east, Stoltenberg said the alliance was concerned \u201cthat Russia is trying to stage a pretext for an armed attack against Ukraine.\u201dRussia, in turn, aired worries that hawkish forces in Ukraine, encouraged by the West, could launch an attack to reclaim control of the rebel areas \u2014 plans Ukrainian authorities deny.A 2015 deal brokered by France and Germany helped end the worst of the fighting in eastern Ukraine, but regular skirmishes have continued and a political settlement has stalled.The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to hold its annual meeting on the agreement on Thursday.Russia denies it is plotting an invasion but says it\u2019s free to deploy troops wherever necessary to counter threats from NATO. It wants the West to keep Ukraine and other former Soviet nations out of NATO, halt weapons deployments near Russian borders and roll back forces from Eastern Europe, the demands the allis have flatly rejected.There have been some suggestions Ukraine could decide to abandon its hope of joining NATO \u2014 something written into its constitution \u2014 as a way out of the crisis. It\u2019s not clear how or if it would do that.While the U.S. and its allies have rejected Moscow\u2019s demands to bar membership to Ukraine, they offered to engage in talks with Russia on limiting missile deployments in Europe, restrictions on military drills and other confidence-building measures.Russian President Vladimir Putin charged that Moscow had offered to discuss those issues years ago, but the West only agreed to talk about them now. He said that Russia was ready to talk about them now, but only in conjunction with its main security demands.Even as Russia seemed to try to ease tensions this week, Maxar Technologies, a commercial satellite imagery company that has been monitoring the Russian buildup, reported continued heightened military activity near Ukraine. It noted a new pontoon bridge and a new field hospital in Belarus. It also said that some forces had left an airfield in the country, a Russian ally, but it was unclear where they went.Blinken and U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris were among political, military and diplomatic leaders heading to the annual security conference in Munich that will see urgent consultations on the crisis.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostReporter, HuffPostThe 2022 midterm elections present a serious threat to the freedom and autonomy of Washington, D.C., as House Republicans want to limit the city\u2019s governance if they win in November.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Rep. James Comer (R.Ky.), the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee, which has jurisdiction over the District of Columbia, earlier this month both suggested a renewed focus on limiting the city\u2019s ability to govern itself if they win power. Going even further, Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.), a member of the Oversight Committee, told The Daily Caller that he is working on legislation to entirely strip Washington of its autonomy by repealing the 1973 D.C. Home Rule Act. The Home Rule Act allowed an elected mayor and city council to set policy for the District\u2019s residents for the first time in the city\u2019s history.\u201cIt\u2019s absurd,\u201d Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said about the proposal to strip the District of home rule. But, she added, it\u2019s also \u201cthe kind of threat that I simply have to take seriously.\u201dThe District of Columbia, home to 700,000 Americans, is not a state and, despite the Home Rule Act, is still subject to interference by Congress. As the city became home to a large Black population following the Civil War, Southern segregationists in Congress sought to limit the city\u2019s autonomy while imposing Jim Crow rules on its population. That desire to squash the city\u2019s independent governance remains in the contemporary Republican Party.Even if a Republican-controlled Congress approved it, a bill to eliminate the District\u2019s home rule status would need to surpass the Senate\u2019s filibuster threshold, which remains intact. It would also need the signature of the president, something Joe Biden would not provide. But that it even exists suggests that many congressional Republicans are eager to expand the anti-democratic wave of restrictive voting laws the party has passed in states to the District. And D.C. \u2014 a favorite punching bag for Republicans angry that the city is governed almost exclusively by Democrats \u2014 could sit at the forefront of those efforts, with its lack of statehood leaving it vulnerable to lawmakers its residents don\u2019t elect.Republicans claim their desire to strip the District of autonomy or limit its law-making powers stems from the rising homicide rate, the increase in homelessness and the imposition of COVID-19 restrictions. But homicide rates have risen in urban and rural communities across the country during the pandemic; homelessness has increased in places where housing costs have skyrocketed due to a limited supply of homes; and the District just announced an end to both its mask and vaccine mandates for private businesses.But Holmes Norton, who has served as the District\u2019s non-voting representative in Congress since 1991, believes Republicans have a more nefarious motive for targeting the nation\u2019s capital.\u201cMy only notion about how something as absurd as this could come forward is that they see how close we\u2019re getting to statehood,\u201d she said.For the second time in 50 years, the District is making a realistic push to become the country\u2019s 51st state. The House passed a bill to make D.C. the 51st state in the previous and current sessions of Congress. A companion bill in the Senate is now supported by all but four members of the Senate Democratic Caucus. D.C. residents broadly support the push: In 2016, 85% of voters favored a referendum on statehood, which would grant full representation, voting rights and governing autonomy to the nation\u2019s capital and the people who live there. A majority of D.C. residents are Black or Latino, and the statehood push, activists argue, is an important aspect of broader Democratic efforts to bolster civil and voting rights in the face of Republican efforts to implement new voting restrictions and other anti-democratic measures in states nationwide. While a statehood bill must ultimately clear the 60-vote filibuster threshold in the Senate and two Democrats oppose changing the rule, support for filibuster reform has become a default position among Democratic Senate candidates. This means the filibuster\u2019s end is a question of when, not if.For statehood advocates, Republican proposals to attack the city\u2019s autonomy are just further evidence of the need to get out from under the thumb of Congress and become the 51st state. \u201cIf the GOP overturns home rule, we\u2019ll lose the little autonomy we currently have over the District\u2019s basic functions: schools, safety, reproductive rights, COVID protocols, and so much more,\u201d said Jamal Holtz, lead organizer of 51 for 51, a pro-statehood group. \u201cWe can\u2019t continue living in fear of the whims of a white member of Congress from thousands of miles away. The only remedy to protect the 700,000 Washingtonians in perpetuity is to make D.C. the 51st state.\u201dIn a statement, Patrice Snow, the communications director for D.C. Vote, said: \u201cThe announcement of their anti-democratic plot also demonstrates the movement to enfranchise the 700,000 tax paying American citizens in Washington, DC through Statehood is loud, proud, and working successfully toward its goal.\u201dThis isn\u2019t the first time Republicans floated the idea of stripping D.C. of home rule. In the late 1990s, House Republicans talked about doing just that after Congress imposed a financial control board on the city to get control of its finances during Marion Barry\u2019s second term as mayor. Norton sees the current attack on the city as \u201centirely different from\u201d the proposal in the \u201990s, as the city is currently running a budget surplus (rather than the deficit it ran under Barry).Many D.C.-based activists also regard statehood as a question of when, rather than if. And in response, congressional Republicans who\u2019ve failed to make legitimate counterarguments against statehood itself are resorting to an all-out attack on the ability of District residents to govern themselves.\u201cTheir call to rescind the Home Rule Act moves beyond the typical game of using DC residents to score cheap political points at home and into a racist attack on the fundamental right to representation,\u201d Snow said. \u201cAll Americans deserve the freedom to vote, the freedom to govern ourselves and the freedom to determine our own destiny. It\u2019s only because of our lack of Statehood that these Representatives feel empowered to deny those freedoms and engage in the racist subjugation of American citizens.\u201dReporter, HuffPostReporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostAfter three years in Congress, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said she firmly believes the institution is a daily \u201cshit show,\u201d but she remains hopeful that the kind of grassroots action that propelled her to Washington could affect greater change.\u201cIt\u2019s scandalizing, every single day,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told The New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick in an interview published Monday. \u201cWhat is surprising to me is how it never stops being scandalizing. Some folks perhaps get used to it, or desensitized to the many different things that may be broken, but there is so much reliance on this idea that there are adults in the room.\u201dShe added that many Democrats were hyper-focused on programs like President Joe Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan or the perpetual threat of upcoming elections at the expense of even bigger ideas like the Build Back Better legislation or the protection of voting rights. Ocasio-Cortez said she wished Democrats had \u201cmore stones\u201d and were \u201ccapable of truly supporting bold leadership that can address root causes.\u201d \u201cOur job is to be able to engage in that conversation, to read what is happening and to be able to develop a vision and translate it into a course of action,\u201d she said. \u201cAll too often, I believe that a lot of our decisions are reactive to public discourse instead of responsive to public discourse.\u201dRead the full interview in The New Yorker here.Ocasio-Cortez also said the U.S. was in danger of a return to the Jim Crow era, when voting rights laws disenfranchised voters of color in the American South. She pointed to efforts in Texas and Florida to limit access to voting that were built on Republican dog-whistles about nonexistent voter fraud after Biden won the White House in the 2020 election. \u201cYou have it already happening in Texas, where Jim Crow-style disenfranchisement laws have already been proposed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question that we\u2019re really facing is: Was the last 50 to 60 years after the Civil Rights Act just a mere flirtation that the United States had with a multiracial democracy that we will then decide was inconvenient for those in power?\u201dDespite those concerns \u2015 and an ongoing attack on her character from right-wing factions \u2015 Ocasio-Cortez said she still believed in the idea of grassroots change.\u201cWhen people start engaging individually enough, it starts to amount to something bigger,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a culture of immediate gratification where if you do something and it doesn\u2019t pay off right away, we think it\u2019s pointless. But, if more people start to truly cherish and value the engagement and the work in their own back yard, it will precipitate much larger change.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2015 President Joe Biden on Tuesday welcomed Russian overtures toward ending a crisis in Ukraine, but reiterated that he was ready to respond with overwhelming economic sanctions if an invasion occurs.\u201cWe should give diplomacy every chance to succeed,\u201d Biden said in brief remarks from the East Room of the White House. \u201cWe will not sacrifice basic principles, though.\u201dThose principles, he said, include Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and its right to territorial integrity.\u201cThe United States is prepared no matter what happens,\u201d he said, noting that \u201can invasion remains distinctly possible.\u201dBiden made clear to Americans that he has no intention of sending U.S. troops to Ukraine, though he has approved the training of Ukrainian troops and the transfer of weapons to the country. He also warned that should an invasion take place, there would be economic consequences in the United States, including higher gas prices.\u201cI will not pretend this will not be painless,\u201d he said, adding that he would try to alleviate such pain as best he could. Nevertheless, he said that in the event Russia invades, a response would be necessary. \u201cIf we do not stand for freedom where it is at risk today, we\u2019ll surely pay a steeper price tomorrow.\u201dBiden also at one point spoke directly to Russian citizens. \u201cWe\u2019re not targeting the people of Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not seek to destabilize Russia. To the citizens of Russia, you are not our enemy. And I do not believe you want a bloody, destructive war against Ukraine, a country and a people with whom you share such deep ties of family, history and culture.\u201dHours earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin, following a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, had indicated that he was ready for talks regarding Ukraine and military transparency. Prior to that, a Russian defense official had said some Russian troops would be leaving the area.Biden has spent much of his time in recent weeks working to dissuade Putin from further aggressive action toward Ukraine, and urging allies in Western Europe to present a common front.Last week, with Scholz at his side in the White House, he declared that a lucrative natural gas pipeline from Russia to Germany would never become operational if Putin moved further into Ukraine. \u201cThere will no longer be a Nord Stream 2,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe will bring an end to it.\u201dSince then, he has again spoken to Putin, as well as to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, from Camp David.Putin has amassed more than 100,000 troops along Ukraine\u2019s border in recent months, raising fears of another invasion. In 2014, he invaded and annexed Crimea from Ukraine, which gained independence during the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. He later moved into the eastern part of the country as well.In order to pressure Putin, Biden\u2019s administration has relied on the strategy of releasing intelligence assessments about Russia\u2019s preparations and its likely intentions. Last month, for example, the administration made public indications that Russia intended to release a video depicting a fake Ukrainian attack on its forces \u2015 including actors playing corpses \u2015 to justify an incursion.Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 New York City fired more than a thousand workers who failed to comply with the city\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, the mayor\u2019s office said Monday.The 1,430 workers who lost their jobs represent less than 1% of the 370,000-person city workforce and are far fewer terminations than expected before a Friday deadline to get the shots.The city sent notices in late January to up to 4,000 workers, saying they had to show proof they got at least two doses of the vaccine or else they\u2019d lose their jobs. Three-quarters of those workers had already been on leave without pay for months, having missed an earlier deadline for getting vaccinated in order to stay on the job.Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 office said hundreds of workers produced proof of their vaccines or got the shots after being notified they would be fired.\u201cCity workers served on the front lines during the pandemic, and by getting vaccinated, they are, once again, showing how they are willing to do the right thing to protect themselves and all New Yorkers,\u201d Adams said in a statement. \u201cOur goal was always to vaccinate, not terminate, and city workers stepped up and met the goal placed before them.\u201dOf the 1,430 fired workers, about 64% worked for the city\u2019s education department. The United Federation of Teachers, the public school teachers\u2019 union, said last week that about 700 of its members had been given notice they would be fired. The union joined with others to sue to block the firings, but a judge ruled in favor of the city on Thursday.The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday dismissed an appeal from a group of Department of Education employees.New York City has imposed some of the most sweeping vaccine mandates in the country, requiring almost all city workers to be vaccinated and requiring private employers to ensure their workers get vaccinated as well. Customers of restaurants, gym and entertainment venues also have to show proof of vaccine to enter.The United Federation of Teachers had struck a deal with the city to allow its members to choose to stay on unpaid leave until September 5. But about 700 members opted not to extend their leave or provide proof of vaccine. The union contended that the workers deserved due process that involved a hearing before being fired.The United Federation of Teachers did not immediately have a comment Monday on the numbers released by the city.Last week, New York City averaged about 1,700 new cases of the virus per day, according to state statistics. That\u2019s down from nearly 41,000 cases per day at the peak of the omicron wave in early January, but still about 56% higher than when the vaccine mandate was announced for city employees in October.___Follow Price on Twitter at twitter.com/michellelprice\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Several conservative media figures in the U.S. have taken up the cause of Canadian truckers who have occupied parts of Ottawa and blocked border crossings to protest COVID-19 restrictions and vaccine mandates.Fox News Channel\u2019s Sean Hannity cheered the truckers on while showing three live reports from Ottawa this week, while Tucker Carlson\u2019s online store is selling \u201cI (heart) Tucker\u201d t-shirts edited to say \u201cI (heart) Truckers.\u201d\u201cPlease tell these truckers that the American working people, people in this country, stand in solidarity with what they are doing and for the freedom movement that they\u2019re leading,\u201d Hannity told reporter Sara Carter on his show Wednesday. She delivered his message to protesters in Ottawa.In a bulletin to local and state law enforcement officers, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned that it has received reports of similar protests being planned in the United States.The agency said the protest could begin in Southern California as early as this weekend and potentially spread to Washington around the State of the Union address in March.COVID-19 vaccines, usually administered in two doses and supplemented with a booster shot, are considered highly effective in preventing serious illness and death. Some people can still get the coronavirus, particularly the Omicron variant, while vaccinated, but most cases are mild. The vast majority of people who get serious cases of the disease are unvaccinated.Between Jan. 18 through Wednesday, Fox News Channel has devoted 8 hours, 43 minutes of airtime to the story, according to the liberal watchdog Media Matters for America, which frequently criticizes the network.But it\u2019s not just Fox.Ben Shapiro of The Daily Wire said on his show, sitting in front of a headline that said Canadians were \u201cfed up\u201d with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, that mandates had to stop. The protesters are particularly upset about a requirement that all truck drivers entering the country be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. An estimated 90 percent of Canadian truckers already are.\u201cNobody wants giant bridges shut down,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cObstructing traffic is bad no matter what you are protesting for. However, the cause of this protest happens to be righteous.\u201dThe lead story on the Red State website for a time Thursday was headlined, \u201cEast Bound and Down: US Truck Convoy is Being Planned, Could Be Headed to DC.\u201d Reporter Sarah Lee mocked a \u201cvery silly\u201d piece in Politico that quoted an analyst, who works for a think tank that tracks extremism, that she sees worrying parallels to the buildup before the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol insurrection.Hannity\u2019s support for what Ontario Prime Minister Doug Ford has called an occupation comes after months where he decried violence and destruction of property at some Black Lives Matter protests in the United States.The difference, he said, is the Canadian \u201cFreedom Convoy\u201d is peaceful. On Monday, Hannity interviewed a reporter from the conservative website Rebel News, who described the Ottawa protest site as a \u201cfamily environment\u201d and \u201clike a Canada Day festival every day.\u201dThe protests have been largely peaceful, although some residents have complained of harassment and there is an arson investigation tied to one incident. Shapiro said critics of the truckers are guilty of \u201cnutpacking,\u201d or focusing on a crazed person and linking them to the entire protest movement.It\u2019s a familiar tactic in politics: pointing to a more extreme position held by a member of an opposition party and saying it represents everyone.Lara Trump, the former U.S. president\u2019s daughter-in-law and a Fox News contributor, offered her support for the truckers on Hannity\u2019s show Tuesday.\u201cRight here in America, people are cheering them on, because this is about freedom,\u201d she said.In a lengthy monologue on his show this week, Carlson suggested that it was inconsistent for the \u201cintellectual elite\u201d to largely support protest movements started by workers yet oppose this one. He said that many time trends start in the United States and move to Canada, but this time the opposite could happen.\u201cThe trucker convoy in Canada is pretty cool,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople getting together to promote human rights.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostSen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) on Thursday called out his Republican colleagues for their racist treatment of President Joe Biden\u2019s court picks, saying their word choice and unusual hostility toward nominees of color has been \u201cdemeaning\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not lost on me that nominees of color have been treated differently in our hearings,\u201d Padilla said during a Judiciary Committee hearing. \u201cWhether it\u2019s insinuations of a \u2018rap sheet\u2019 or hostility about their qualifications or views, or undue scrutiny of their personal religious faith.\u201dThe California senator made his comments as the committee was preparing to vote on advancing an African American nominee, Andre Mathis, who is Biden\u2019s pick for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit based in Tennessee.Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), who opposes Mathis and has complained that the White House didn\u2019t consult with her enough on his nomination to a court seat in her state, raised eyebrows last month when she said she had concerns with Mathis and referenced his \u201crap sheet\u201d of old speeding tickets, a suggestion of a criminal record when there is none.\u201cHe has a rap sheet with a laundry list of citations, including multiple failures to appear in court,\u201d Blackburn said at the time. \u201cIn Tennessee, we expect our judges to respect the law.\u201dIn fact, Mathis\u2019 \u201crap sheet\u201d \u2014 a term for a person\u2019s criminal history that stems from the acronym for Record of Arrests and Prosecutions \u2013 was related to three speeding tickets he got more than 10 years ago, one of which was for going 5 miles over the speed limit. His driver\u2019s license was temporarily suspended when he forgot to pay them and subsequently did not show up to court.Padilla said Thursday that it was \u201cparticularly troubling\u201d to see the way Mathis was treated by Blackburn in last month\u2019s hearing.\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: Mr. Mathis is not a career criminal or a violent felon, as the question implied. He has never been arrested or convicted of a crime,\u201d he said, as Blackburn sat feet away from him on the dais. \u201cThe underlying issue being commented on was traffic violations dating over a decade ago. Whether it was unintentional or intentional, questions and tones like what I heard during his hearing are demeaning, offensive and just plain wrong.\u201dHe added that Mathis \u201cunfortunately isn\u2019t the only nominee to receive this kind of treatment\u201d and said his GOP colleagues need to be \u201ccognizant of this disparity\u201d in the way they treat nominees of color.Some Republicans responded with anger.\u201cThe extent he was suggesting racial bias on the part of members of this committee, I know that to be grossly inaccurate, extraordinarily unfair and also of the very sort of comment that would incite people to anger, acts of retaliation and violence,\u201d said Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). \u201cI hope I misunderstood the comments of our colleague. Either way, to accuse colleagues who disagree with you of racism is a very serious thing.\u201dSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), perhaps best known as the U.S. senator who raised his fist in solidarity with white supremacist rioters just before they stormed the Capitol building to try to overturn the 2020 presidential election, said he agreed with Lee.\u201cFrankly, I\u2019m startled to hear it,\u201d Hawley said of Padilla\u2019s accusations of racism. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s reprehensible and I think it\u2019s wrong and I think it is highly destructive \u2014 highly destructive \u2014 of any efforts of bipartisanship and consensus building. I just have to say, I\u2019m deeply disappointed by it.\u201dBut Padilla wasn\u2019t the only member of the committee who commented on the way that Biden\u2019s court picks, most of whom have been women and people of color, have been treated differently by Republicans.\u201cI worry about the charges made against some nominees, which seem to be, in some cases, thinly veiled charges because they are a woman or a person of color,\u201d said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the longest-serving member of the Senate and a former longtime chairman of the Judiciary Committee.Leahy has previously called out Republicans for being particularly disrespectful to female judicial nominees and for consistently opposing nominees who are women of color.\u201cI\u2019ve seen, in my years here, which is longer than anybody else\u2019s ... a disproportionate number of votes against women and people of color, especially women of color,\u201d the Vermont senator said in a September hearing.Even Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the chairman of the committee, who mostly tries to keep the peace in hearings, told reporters last month that some of Biden\u2019s court picks have been \u201cmore controversial than I anticipated\u201d among Republicans. He made his comments in the context of Biden\u2019s plan to pick a Black woman as his Supreme Court nominee.When HuffPost asked if there is a theme to the Biden nominees who have unexpectedly become controversial, Durbin said bluntly, \u201cAssertive women of color.\u201dThe committee ultimately voted to send Mathis\u2019 nomination to the Senate floor for a confirmation vote. The vote was 12-10, with one Republican, Sen. John Kennedy (La.), voting yes with Democrats.Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Front Page Editor, HuffPostThis week, the Washington Free Beacon reported that President Joe Biden\u2019s administration plans to fund the distribution of \u201ccrack pipes\u201d to drug users in an effort to advance racial equity. The report from the right-leaning outlet quickly became official GOP messaging. \u201cBiden crime policy: Crack pipes for all. What could go wrong?\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) tweeted. \u201cNothing says \u2018Democrat Priorities\u2019 like raising the price of insulin on Day 1 but making crack pipes free,\u201d Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) added. That message soon went viral. Other news outlets ran with the headline that the Biden administration was funding programs to hand out crack pipes. But the driving narrative has been misleading, dangerous and tinged with racist dog whistles. The Department of Health and Human Services recently drafted a grant application for its harm reduction program, which is part of an effort to reduce infections spread through drug use and other impacts of drug addiction. The grant would provide funds over three years for services including community-based overdose prevention programs, syringe services programs and overdose education programs, as well as \u201cequipment and supplies to enhance harm reduction efforts.\u201dThe grant description stated that funding may go toward \u201csafe smoking kits/supplies\u201d \u2014 which could include crack supplies, as Republicans have said \u2014 but that\u2019s hardly the focus. And the cynical GOP misinformation leaves out why medical experts endorse such an approach.\u201cHarm reduction is still really hard for people to wrap their mind around it. Crack instills a particular level of fear and stigma.\u201dThe idea of giving drug users safe smoking kits and supplies is a key component of harm reduction, an evidence-backed approach that tries to meet people where they\u2019re at, according to the National Harm Reduction Coalition. Kassandra Frederique, the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a national nonprofit that advocates for drug law reform, likened the strategy to approaches people are more familiar with, like using condoms for sexual health and wellness. \u201cWhat research has consistently shown us is that when we give people access to safer smoking equipment, it\u2019s resulted in increased health risk awareness for people that are using drugs,\u201d Frederique told HuffPost.\u201cPeople are using drugs. It\u2019s really important for us to give people information and educate folks about ways they can moderate their drug use or reduce the risk that can happen with some kinds of drug use,\u201d she explained.Yes, glass crack pipes are sometimes included in harm reduction kits. So are syringes and condoms. On top of that, these kits are already distributed in various parts of the country. On Wednesday, the Biden administration came out and said it would not fund harm reduction programs that use pipes. The announcement comes after heavy pressure from the right, but officials insisted they weren\u2019t caving to the negative headlines. \u201cNo federal funding will be used directly or through subsequent reimbursement of grantees to put pipes in safe smoking kits,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra and White House drug czar Dr. Rahul Gupta said in a statement, adding that they plan to prioritize the use of life-saving medications like Narcan, fentanyl test strips and syringes.\u201cFederal funding will not be used to put pipes in the kits or distribute them,\u201d a senior administration official also told HuffPost. \u201cToday, [HHS] clarified that no federal funding can be used for some specific elements that may be included in those kits. The contents of kits often vary by state based upon federal and state law.\u201dProviding supplies like glass pipes, however, helps to reduce overdoses and prevents harm caused by smoking plastic, aluminum or copper pipes, which can severely damage the lungs and other organs. They also help drug users avoid transmitting HIV or hepatitis C through cut or burnt lips. A critical part of harm reduction is ensuring drug users don\u2019t die or further complicate their health if they do not have access to clean resources.The misinformation spread by GOP leaders has led to a perfect viral storm, with headlines honing in on \u201cracial equity\u201d as a key component of the program. \u201cThe Biden administration will be sending crack pipes and meth pipes targeting minority communities in this country,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). Rubio\u2019s words were reminiscent of the racist dog whistles surrounding crack cocaine, a drug that has been highly stigmatized ever since the infamous campaign against it in the 1980s. The HHS funding was never directly aimed at promoting racial equity, although Biden has explicitly stated that advancing equity and support for communities of color will be a cornerstone of his administration. \u201cHarm reduction is still really hard for people to wrap their mind around it. Crack instills a particular level of fear and stigma,\u201d Frederique said.\u201cThe whole country rallied around crack criminalization and the stigma around it,\u201d she added. \u201cEven if you look at the media headlines of now, they really invoke that kind of same emotional response that folks had in the \u201980s and \u201990s.\u201dSenior Front Page Editor, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

But we can responsibly take this step due to declining COVID numbers and growth in vaccinations. https://t.co/CjnIYZycCeThe numbers of new COVID-19 cases in New Jersey have dropped more than 70% in the past two weeks. It\u2019s one of the most vaccinated states, with nearly three-quarters of all people in the state considered \u201cfully vaccinated\u201d and about one-third having received a booster dose. Delaware\u2019s Gov. John Carney (D) also announced Monday that his state\u2019s school mask mandate will expire March 31 and that schools and school districts will be able to consider their own masking rules going forward. He urged parents to vaccinate their eligible children in the pursuit of returning to normalcy at schools. \u201cFor all the parents out there \u2014 the best way to keep your child in school learning, and to prevent them from getting sick, is to get them vaccinated,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s that simple.

Mask mandates, particularly those in schools, have firmly divided Democratic and Republican lawmakers.

Some GOP lawmakers, meanwhile, have gone so far as to ban local governments and school districts from enacting mask ordinances. With COVID-19 cases plummeting after reaching staggering new levels in mid-January, Murphy and other Democrats are now signaling some optimism about the state of the pandemic. Last month, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf (D) ended his statewide school mask mandate and said schools could set their own rules. New York Gov.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Labor Reporter, HuffPostWith labor union membership hovering near a historic low, the White House is looking at ways to increase union organizing through new federal policies that won\u2019t require the cooperation of Congress.A task force led by Vice President Kamala Harris and Labor Secretary Marty Walsh sent dozens of recommendations to President Joe Biden on Monday that could \u201cfacilitate worker power through executive action.\u201d The basic idea is to make the government a \u201cmodel employer,\u201d through federal agencies and their contractors, by encouraging workers to organize.\u201cFederal taxpayer dollars should be used to advance our national policy to encourage unions and collective bargaining,\u201d the report said. \u201cIn many cases, facilitating worker organizing and collective bargaining will increase agencies\u2019 ability to carry out their missions.\u201dThe report said a dozen federal agencies will start attaching preferences or \u201cotherwise encourage strong labor standards\u201d when they dole out grants and contracts to private-sector employers. And four agencies, including the Defense Department, will take steps to make sure contractors don\u2019t use federal money on anti-union campaigns.The plan also includes making it easier for union organizers to access federal property to make their case to workers for unionization, and using federal agencies to make workers more aware of their rights on the job. The Labor Department, in particular, will be \u201cproviding materials on the advantages of union representation and collective bargaining.\u201dUnions have been pushing the administration to try to require businesses that contract with the government to stay neutral in union organizing campaigns, but the report did not explicitly recommend that. It said the White House should develop a list of \u201cjob quality metrics\u201d that guide federal agencies on where to assign contracts and grants. A White House official said Biden accepted the recommendations in the report. The task force will follow up with another report in six months looking at how the plan has been implemented.Many of the ideas are inherently limited because they don\u2019t apply to all workers \u2013 only those employed by the federal government or its contractors. But the report serves as a formal acknowledgment that the White House can do plenty on its own to promote collective bargaining without going through Congress. Biden has endorsed a far more sweeping plan to boost unions, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which has so far failed to gain enough support in the Senate. The legislation would amount to the most significant reform to labor law in 75 years, overriding state right-to-work laws and ramping up penalties for companies that illegally bust unions, among other measures. As a presidential candidate, Biden promised to \u201censure federal dollars do not flow to employers who engage in union-busting activities, participate in wage theft, or violate labor law.\u201d On different occasions, he has said he intends to be the most pro-union president ever.Indeed, Biden has taken several steps to help unions, including overhauling the National Labor Relations Board and immediately firing the general counsel appointed by former President Donald Trump. He has also used the bully pulpit, including in unprecedented fashion, to encourage collective bargaining.Union membership remains very low by historical standards. It\u2019s estimated that roughly one in three workers belonged to unions following World War II. The number is approximately one in 10 today \u2013 and even lower in the private sector \u2013 despite the fact that the general public views unions more favorably now than in decades.The task force attributed the drop in union density \u2013 and growing income inequality \u2013 to specific government policies shaped by Congress and the Supreme Court over the years.\u201cReversing this trend is in our power,\u201d the report states.Labor Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

In 2021, the publication found 206 million square feet of space to detain the Muslim minority \u2013 enough to hold a million people at the same time, which is likely an undercount given the probable overcrowding in the facilities.\u201cThis is not business as usual. We know that a genocide has been committed there. We have called them out on it. The president has called them out on it. And we have made clear that crimes against humanity are being committed in China,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield said Sunday.\u201cSo, it is important that the audience who participated and witnessed this understand that this does not take away from what we know is happening on the ground there. You have reported it regularly on your network, and others have reported this,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe have to ensure that we continue to raise these concerns that are occurring in China at the moment.\u201dChina has dismissed the accusations of abuses, and claims its actions against Uyghurs are simply education and training programs meant to root out extremism.\u201cThat was very, very much a deliberate choice,\u201d Darren Byler, a Canadian international studies processor who has written extensively about the camps, told AP of Yilamujiang lighting the Olympic flame. \u201cI think it should be read as China saying we are not backing away from our stance on what we\u2019re doing in Xinjiang and we don\u2019t really care what the world thinks about it.\u201dYilamujiang was set to make her Olympic sporting debut less than 24 hours after her torchbearing duties. But by the first checkpoint of Saturday\u2019s cross-country skiing race, Yilamujiang had fallen behind more than half of her competitors, eventually finishing 43rd out of 65.Despite International Olympic Committee rules requiring all athletes to pass through a \u201cmixed zone\u201d where they can answer journalists\u2019 questions, Yilamujiang and three other Chinese athletes competing in the event quietly slipped away. The move marked a whirlwind weekend that first catapulted the athlete into the global spotlight before her Olympic debut was barely mentioned in the Chinese media.\u201cWe support our athletes. And we think our athletes are there to perform in the areas that they have been preparing for, for four years. And we would hope that the Chinese would not take any actions,\u201d Thomas-Greenfield said of Americans who speak out against China. \u201cBut I will be clear that our goal is to make sure our athletes are safe. And we\u2019re doing everything possible to ensure that.\u201dReporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The sound level downtown now exceeds limits established by Canada\u2019s Federal Occupational Health and Safety Regulations, the complaint states.\u201cThis is a siege.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostDuring the 2020 campaign, President Joe Biden pledged to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court and he reiterated that promise after Justice Stephen Breyer announced his imminent retirement at the end of January.\u201cThe person I will nominate will be someone of extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity, and that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States Supreme Court,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI made that commitment during the campaign for president, and I will keep that commitment.\u201dThis quickly produced unsurprising squeals from conservative corners about both \u201caffirmative action\u201d and \u201cpoliticization.\u201dSens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) all bashed Biden for advancing a nominee based on a \u201cquota.\u201d Editors for the conservative National Review wrote that Biden \u201cdisqualified dozens of liberal and progressive jurists for no reason other than their race and gender.\u201d Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) took her criticism in a slightly different direction, calling Biden\u2019s announcement that he would choose a Black woman \u201cclumsy,\u201d for adding \u201cto the further perception that the court is a political institution like Congress, when it is not supposed to be.\u201dBut Biden\u2019s public statement that he would appoint someone to increase or maintain the diversity of the Supreme Court is nothing new. Ronald Reagan declared weeks before Election Day in 1980 that he would appoint the first woman to the Supreme Court if given the chance. And he did, appointing Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor. Donald Trump also promised, weeks before the 2020 election, that he would fill the seat of the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with another woman.In fact, the presidential selection of Supreme Court justices has always followed from political interests, and often in the pursuit of diverse representation. It\u2019s just that the concept of diversity has changed as the nation \u2014 and the face of the electorate \u2014 itself changed. Meanwhile, the politicization of the court has been obscured by a phony narrative that elite qualifications are the only criteria.To begin with, all but three justices from 1789 to 1900 were chosen solely from the pool of white men of Protestant faith. While constituting the vast majority of the U.S. electorate during this period, white Protestant men were then and remain now a minority of the overall U.S. population. With regional divisions as the primary challenge in the early republic, presidents sought to balance the court with regional diversity from within this specific demographic. Justices were chosen based on which region \u2014 New England or the South \u2014 or which state they hailed from. Furthermore, presidents generally wanted justices who would reflect their political party\u2019s agenda. All of these limitations further limited the pool of potential candidates, sometimes so much that it was hard to find a candidate who fit the criteria and wanted the job.Take, for example, President James Madison\u2019s efforts to fill the seat of the late William Cushing in 1810. Since Cushing hailed from Massachusetts, Madison sought out another New Englander, preferably one amenable to his Republican Party. New England being a Federalist redoubt made for a small pool of potential candidates. After two candidates from Massachusetts refused the appointment and one from Connecticut was rejected by the Senate for lacking what they saw as the proper qualifications, Madison found success with Massachusetts\u2019 Joseph Story.This seat would be held by a New Englander for more than 120 years: three more occupants from Massachusetts and one each from Maine and New Hampshire. It would not be until 1932 that the New England seat passed to a justice not from that region, New York\u2019s Benjamin Cardozo, the second Jewish Supreme Court justice.Cardozo was not selected by President Herbert Hoover because he was Jewish, but his seat came to be known as the \u201cJewish seat,\u201d as it passed to three sequential Jewish justices over the next 30 years, and exemplified a new era of diversity on the court.Regional factionalism still played a role into the 20th century, but presidents increasingly sought to provide representation to new immigrant groups, including the massive influx of Catholics and Jews at the turn of the century, in order to secure their votes in elections. Presidents including William McKinley, William Harding, Franklin Roosevelt and Dwight Eisenhower all chose Catholic justices with political considerations in mind. It was FDR who began the informal tradition of preserving a Catholic seat on the bench when he replaced Catholic justice Pierce Butler with the Catholic Frank Murphy.When President Harry Truman replaced Murphy with a Protestant, he presented a political opportunity for Republicans to appeal to the Catholic vote. That\u2019s what Eisenhower did when he chose William Brennan ahead of the 1956 election, both because he was a Catholic and a Democrat. Eisenhower explicitly sought out a Catholic justice. Upon the announcement of a coming opening on the court, Eisenhower told his attorney general to \u201cstart thinking again about [naming] a very good Catholic,\u201d in a note.The previous firsts for Supreme Court diversity were not made with the express intent of breaking a barrier. President Andrew Jackson didn\u2019t make Roger Taney the first Catholic justice because he was Catholic. Nor did President Woodrow Wilson choose Louis Brandeis to be the first Jewish justice. President Lyndon Johnson did, however, pick Thurgood Marshall in 1967 because he wanted to appoint the first Black justice.Marshall, eminently qualified as one of the most experienced lawyers in the country and an appeals court judge, provided Johnson an opportunity to continue to build on his civil rights legacy while also providing representation to Black Americans as they played an increasingly important role within the Democratic Party coalition.Johnson didn\u2019t just choose to appoint Marshall two years before he actually got the chance. He purposefully worked to further raise Marshall\u2019s profile by appointing him solicitor general while also scheming to open a seat on the court for him: Johnson selected Supreme Court justice Tom Clark\u2019s son as attorney general in order to create a conflict of interest, pushing Clark to retire.Even though he had made up his mind early to appoint the first Black justice, Johnson never publicly stated his intention to do so prior to picking Marshall. Reagan, on the other hand, said in the final month of the 1980 election that he would put the first woman on the Supreme Court if elected. He won and selected Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, a little known Arizona judge, in 1981.Reagan\u2019s campaign announcement that he would pick a woman justice was explicitly political, as it was meant to address his lagging poll numbers with women.Since then there have remained at least one Black justice and one woman on the court. While George H.W. Bush denied selecting Clarence Thomas to replace Marshall upon his retirement because he is Black, Bush\u2019s White House had previously stated to reporters that Bush\u2019s next pick \u2014 after David Souter \u2014 would be Edith Jones. When Marshall retired, Bush did not select Jones, a white woman, instead picking Thomas, a Black man, to fill the only seat ever held by a Black justice.And when Ginsburg died less than two months before the 2020 election, Trump immediately promised that her replacement \u201cwill be a woman.\u201d He chose Amy Coney Barrett, who was rapidly confirmed ahead of the election.Biden\u2019s announcement that he will select a Black woman for the court in no way limits his choice than the decision previous presidents made to only appoint a justice from New England, say, or a justice who is Catholic, or who is Black, or a woman.Nor is the fact that his decision stems from a campaign promise any different than the political calculations taken by numerous other presidents when they sought to appeal to regional factions, religious minorities or ideological blocs as Trump did in the 2016 election by releasing a list of justices he would consider that was prepared for him with the help of the conservative Federalist Society. That\u2019s because there is no single most-qualified nominee who is objectively superior to others. Indeed there exist no qualifications required to be a justice at all. Previous justices included ex-senators, ex-governors and even one ex-president. Most justices lacked law degrees, as such things did not exist for some time, and the majority of chief justices had no prior judicial experience.The reality is that the Supreme Court does not exist outside of politics. Presidents have sought to mold it with representation of factions important to their \u2014 and their party\u2019s \u2014 political and policy goals in mind. Biden is no different.Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Originally, King said, Garson was supposed to appear in all 10 episodes. \u201cBefore I knew that Willie was sick and couldn\u2019t complete it, Stanford was going to have a midlife crisis,\u201d King told Variety in an article published on Tuesday. \u201cStanford\u2019s character always had a borderline career as a manager, and we were like going to explore the fact that it wasn\u2019t a real career.\u201d The director added that Stanford was also \u201cprobably\u201d going to split from his husband, Marentino, who is played by actor Mario Cantone. \u201cThen we would keep both of them in, and everybody would be relieved that they were divorced because it was not pleasant for anybody,\u201d King explained.\u201cBut there was a series of really fun, flirty, hilarious confidante scenes with Carrie that I loved. That old, old, very specific chemistry that Carrie and Stanford have, which is based totally on the uniqueness of Willie and [co-star Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s] history.\u201d But when it came to writing Garson off due to his unexpected death, King didn\u2019t try to make his exit resemble anything \u201ccharming\u201d or \u201ccute.\u201d \u201cLife and death is one thing in fiction: When it\u2019s real, it\u2019s not funny or cute,\u201d King said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to even flirt narratively with cute business about where he is. I knew the audience would never invest in it, because they knew he was never coming back.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the most threadbare writing I\u2019ve ever done just to move him along without much maneuvering, because it was just so sad,\u201d the director added. \u201cThere was no way I could write myself out of that in any charming, cute way.\u201d After news of Garson\u2019s death broke last year, his \u201cSex and the City\u201d castmates paid tribute to their inimitable co-star.Co-stars Kristin Davis and Cynthia Nixon recently spoke about Garson and the gravity of losing him during an appearance on \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d in December. Nixon said the cast and crew filmed with the actor \u201cfor a long time, not knowing he was sick, and then things got bad enough that we were informed.\u201d \u201cWe were also very grateful that we had a few days with him knowing that he was sick,\u201d Nixon said. \u201cAnd we could talk to him about it, and he could talk to us about it. And that, I think, was a really important thing for all of us.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s hard,\u201d Davis said as she began to cry. \u201cI wish he was here, you know?\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "President Joe Biden is committing to reduce the cancer death rate by 50% \u2014 a new goal for the \u201cmoonshot\u201d initiative against the disease that was announced in 2016 when he was vice president.Biden has set a 25-year timeline for achieving that goal, part of his broader effort to end cancer as we know it, according to senior administration officials who previewed Wednesday\u2019s announcement on the condition of anonymity.The issue is deeply personal for Biden: He lost his eldest son, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015.The pain experienced by the president is shared by many Americans. The American Cancer Society estimates that there will be 1,918,030 new cancer cases and 609,360 cancer deaths this year. What Biden is aiming to do is essentially save more than 300,000 lives annually from the disease, something the administration believes is possible because the age-adjusted death rate has already fallen by roughly 25% over the past two decades.Biden was scheduled to give remarks Wednesday from the East Room of the White House, along with his wife, Jill, and Vice President Kamala Harris. Also scheduled to attend the speech: members of Congress and the administration and about 100 members of the cancer community including patients, survivors, caregivers, families, advocacy groups and research organizations.As part of the moonshot, Biden will assemble a \u201ccancer Cabinet\u201d that includes 18 federal departments, agencies and offices, including leaders from the Departments of Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Defense, Energy and Agriculture.There were no plans to announce new funding commitments on Wednesday, though the administration will outline why it believes it can curb cancer through efforts such as increased screening and removing inequities in treatment. The coronavirus pandemic has consumed health care resources and caused people to miss more than 9.5 million cancer screenings.The White House also will host a cancer moonshot summit and continue a roundtable discussion series on the subject. The goal is to improve the quality of treatment and people\u2019s lives, something with deep economic resonance as well. The National Cancer Institute reported in October that the economic burden of treatment was more than $21 billion in 2019, including $16.22 billion in patient out-of-pocket costs.President Barack Obama announced the moonshot program during his final full year in office and secured $1.8 billion over seven years to fund research. Obama designated Biden, then his vice president, as \u201cmission control,\u201d a recognition of Biden\u2019s grief as a parent and desire to do something about it. Biden wrote in his memoir \u201cPromise Me, Dad\u201d that he chose not to run for president in 2016 primarily because of Beau\u2019s death.When Biden announced he wasn\u2019t seeking the Democratic nomination in 2016, he said he regretted not being president because \u201cI would have wanted to have been the president who ended cancer, because it\u2019s possible.\u201dThe moonshot fell somewhat out of the public focus when Donald Trump became president, though Trump, a Republican, proposed $500 million over 10 years for pediatric cancer research in his 2019 State of the Union address.Biden continued the work as a private citizen by establishing the Biden Cancer Initiative to help organize resources to improve cancer care. When Biden did seek the presidency in 2020, he had tears in his eyes as he said in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that \u201cBeau should be running for president, not me.\u201d\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The memorabilia, which is not affiliated with Buckingham Palace, was intended to mark the sovereign\u2019s 70 years on the throne. It was supposed to read: \u201cThe Platinum Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.\u201d Instead, the tea sets, mugs and decorative plates all read \u201cThe Platinum Jubbly of Queen Elizabeth II.\u201d Wholesale Clearance UK, the company that bought the misprinted merch, is trying to offload it at a price of $44,000 for the lot. Wholesale Clearance UK suggested the lucky buyer could somehow then fetch a potential profit of $395,000 on the aptly named \u201cQueens Platinum Jubilee (Jubbly) Souvenir Stock with Slight Typo Mistake.\u201d If you\u2019re not looking to put down that much money at once, you can purchase an individual plate, cup or mug. Wholesale CEO Karl Baxter cheekily suggested in the lot\u2019s description that people who buy the products \u201cTake-up plate spinning as a hobby.\u201d Or, they can simply try to wow friends with their \u201cLovely Jubbly set.\u201d \u201cApart from the obvious gimmick factor,\u201d Baxter said this is a buyer\u2019s chance to own \u201ca unique piece of Jubilee history.\u201d Baxter told HuffPost on Wednesday that the public\u2019s response to the misprinted memorabilia has been \u201cphenomenal.\u201d\u201cPeople have been calling to inquire about the items and a large percentage were saying how it has made their day and brought smiles to their faces,\u201d he said. He told HuffPost he\u2019s also received offers on the entire collection from a repackaging company, a discount firm, and even a promotions company that wants to use the plates, mugs and tea sets as part of a giveaway. Baxter\u2019s timing is impeccable, as Queen Elizabeth will mark her accession to the throne on Feb. 6. Elizabeth became queen 70 years ago on that day \u2014 following the death of her father, King George VI, in 1952. Feb. 6 is generally a solemn day for the queen, and this will be the first time in seven decades that she\u2019ll mark it without her husband by her side, as Prince Philip died last April.She will commemorate her 70 years on the throne in June, beginning with her ceremonial birthday parade on June 2, 2022, during the official Platinum Jubilee celebrations. (The date is significant as the queen was formally crowned on June 2, 1953.)The four-day holiday will include a thanksgiving service, a jubilee lunch and pageant and even a live concert, called the \u201cPlatinum Party at the Palace.\u201d Subscribe to HuffPost\u2019s Watching the Royals newsletter for all things Windsor (and beyond).Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said Monday that Donald Trump\u2019s dangerous comments at a Saturday rally show that the former president would incite another riot like the one on Jan. 6, 2021.The congresswoman, who co-chairs the House select committee investigating the insurrection, said on \u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d that some of Trump\u2019s followers who tried to overturn the 2020 election by violently storming the U.S. Capitol \u201chave been charged with things like seditious conspiracy.\u201d\u201cHe uses the same language that he knows caused the Jan. 6 violence, and I think that it tells us that he clearly would do this all again if he were given the chance,\u201d Cheney said.At a rally in Texas on Saturday night, Trump called on his followers to stage \u201cmassive protests\u201d in multiple cities if he is prosecuted for any crimes.If \u201cthese radical, vicious, racist prosecutors do anything wrong or illegal, I hope we are going to have, in this country, the biggest protests we have ever had in Washington, D.C., in New York, in Atlanta and elsewhere because our country and our elections are corrupt,\u201d he told his audience.In between his repeated lies that the 2020 election was fraudulent, Trump also said he would offer pardons to his followers who were charged for crimes in the insurrection he incited.\u201cIf I run, and if I win, we will treat those people from Jan. 6 fairly.

He was 81.Hesseman died Saturday in Los Angeles due to complications from colon surgery, his manager Robbie Kass said Sunday.Hesseman, who had himself been a radio DJ in the \u201860s, earned two Emmy nominations for playing Johnny Fever on CBS\u2019 \u201cWKRP in Cincinnati,\u201d which ran for four seasons from 1978-1982. The role made Hesseman a counterculture icon at a time when few hippie characters made it onto network television.In the first episode, Dr. Johnny Fever announces the station\u2019s changeover from elevator music to rock \u2019n roll with a record scratch and a proclamation.\u201cAll right Cincinnati, it\u2019s time for this town to get down! You got Johnny, Dr. Johnny Fever, and I am burning up in here. We\u2019re all in critical condition, babies, but you can tell me where it hurts because I got the healing prescription here from the big KRP musical medicine cabinet. Now, I am talking about your 50,000-watt intensive care unit, babies!\u201dAs he readied for one of three \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d hosting gigs, Hesseman told The New York Times in 1979 that the character made network executives nervous. In one episode, Johnny Fever is given an on-air sobriety test after being given alcohol, only his reaction time keeps improving.\u201cI think maybe Johnny smokes a little marijuana, drinks beer and wine, and maybe a little hard liquor,\u201d Hesseman said. \u201cAnd on one of those hard mornings at the station, he might take what for many years was referred to as a diet pill. But he is a moderate user of soft drugs, specifically marijuana.\u201dHesseman played a hippie in one of his first roles, on \u201cDragnet,\u201d in 1967, and also in the 1968 Richard Lester film \u201cPetulia.\u201d Born in Lebanon, Oregon, Hesseman wasn\u2019t so disconnected from some of the characters he played. In 1983, he told People magazine that he had conducted \u201cpharmaceutical experiments in recreational chemistry.\u201d In 1963, he was jailed in San Francisco for selling marijuana.Initially performing under the name Don Sturdy, Hesseman started out as a member of the San Francisco improv group The Committee, which regularly performed at antiwar and civil rights protests.At the time, he also moonlighted on Saturdays as the disk jockey for the San Francisco rock-and-roll station KMPX. Later on \u201cWKRP in Cincinnati\u201d Hesseman often ad-libbed his on-air banter.\u201cImpossible to overstate Howard Hesseman\u2019s influence on his and subsequent generations of improvisors,\u201d said the actor and comedian Michael McKean on Twitter. He recalled first seeing Hesseman in 1971 with The Committee. \u201cI saw that he was the real deal.\u201dHesseman appeared briefly but memorably with McKean in the 1984 rockumentary \u201cThis Is Spinal Tap\u201d as Terry Ladd, manager to the rock superstar Duke Fame. He frankly ends a conversation: \u201cWe\u2019d love to stay and chat but we\u2019re going to sit in the lobby and wait for the limo.\u201d\u201cHoward was eloquent...stylish...and hilarious,\u201d said Loni Anderson, Hesseman\u2019s friend of 40 years and co-star on \u201cWKRP in Cincinnati.\u201d \u201cMy favorite Howard sign-off...a quote by Louis Armstrong...\u2018Jazz is what you are.\u2019 And now Howard, forever missed is just what you are.\u201dIn the ABC sitcom \u201cHead of the Class,\u201d which debuted in 1986, Hesseman played a teacher to a diverse group of students in a classroom where the dialogue was often notably progressive in the 1980s of Ronald Reagan. Hesseman was sometimes critical of the show \u2014 co-created by political activist and writer Michael Elias \u2014 not being as adventurous as he had hoped it would be. He departed it after four seasons and was replaced by Billy Connolly in the fifth and final season.\u201cPart of me says, \u2018Is that all there is? A television series?\u2019 Obviously not. I could go on stage or scratch my way into the movies,\u201d Hesseman said in a 1989 interview. \u201cBut how many movies are made that you want to be a part of? And how many want you? There is a certain kind of \u2018for-rent\u2019 sign on my forehead. I\u2019m an actor and I like to work.\u201dA prolific character actor, Hesseman\u2019s credits also included \u201cThe Andy Griffith Show,\u201d \u201cOne Day at a Time,\u201d \u201cThe Rockford Files,\u201d \u201cLaverne and Shirley\u201d and \u201cThe Bob Newhart Show.\u201d More recently, he made appearances on \u201cThat 70\u2032s Show,\u201d \u201cFresh Off the Boat,\u201d \u201cHouse\u201d and \u201cBoston Legal.\u201d Films included \u201cPolice Academy 2: Their First Assignment,\u201d \u201cAbout Schmidt,\u201d \u201cThis Is Spinal Tap\u201d and \u201cThe Rocker.\u201dHesseman is survived by actor and acting teacher Caroline Ducrocq, his wife.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Politics Reporter, HuffPostCOLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 Morgan Harper said she couldn\u2019t get her main opponent in Ohio\u2019s Democratic Senate primary to debate her, so she opted for the furthest thing from him \u2014 a candidate on the other side of the aisle. Way on the other side.Harper, a progressive underdog, debated far-right Republican Josh Mandel, the presumed front-runner in Ohio\u2019s GOP primary, in an Ohio church on Thursday night.It went as well as you might expect.Mandel, 44, repeatedly said the Democratic Party \u201ccondescends\u201d to people of color like Harper, and he insisted the reason her opponent wouldn\u2019t debate her is because she isn\u2019t a \u201cwhite male.\u201d Mandel also predicted he would set records for winning Black votes in Ohio\u2019s Senate race.Harper, 38, shot back: \u201cWhat we don\u2019t need to happen is have Josh Mandel talk for the Black community.\u201dAt one point, Mandel called Harper a \u201clooney Nancy Pelosi\u201d for \u201cadvocating for all this green energy\u201d when Harper pledged to support renewable energy to help mitigate climate change.In the evening\u2019s most bizarre exchange, Mandel insisted there is no separation between church and state in the United States \u2014 the literal First Amendment of the Constitution.\u201cI\u2019m pro-God, pro-gun, pro-Trump, and I will fight in Washington with the Constitution in one hand and the Bible in the other.\u201d\u201cI do not believe in separation of church and state. There\u2019s no such thing. The founders of this county, the Founding Fathers, they did not believe in the separation of church and state. When you read the United States Constitution, nowhere do you read about the separation of church and state. It does not exist,\u201d he said, followed by an audible gasp from the audience.Naturally, Harper and Mandel couldn\u2019t be further apart on just about everything.\u201cJosh Mandel is the swamp.\u201d\u201cI am scared as a woman, as a Black person, as a daughter who has a mother who lives off of a monthly pension, of getting this guy anywhere near a seat of power in the United States Senate,\u201d Harper said.Harper is a staunch progressive who challenged now-Congressional Black Caucus chair Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) in a 2020 primary. She ran then with the backing of Justice Democrats, the group that helped democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez knock off a New York City incumbent to win her congressional seat.Mandel, a former state treasurer, has veered hard right in the primary, trafficking in election conspiracies and racist rhetoric to appeal to the Trump base \u2014 and Trump himself for a potential endorsement. Mandel has done much of his campaigning in evangelical churches.\u201cI\u2019m pro-God, pro-gun, pro-Trump, and I will fight in Washington with the Constitution in one hand and the Bible in the other,\u201d Mandel said.Ryan\u2019s campaign said it would debate Harper at some point, but right now it\u2019s more focused on meeting voters.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether Josh Mandel is standing in a cornfield calling for an armed insurrection or showing his out-of-touch, anti-worker agenda on the debate stage; he\u2019s wrong for Ohio and doesn\u2019t belong anywhere near the U.S. Senate,\u201d Ryan\u2019s spokesperson Izzi Levy said.Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostCongress is out of session, but Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) nevertheless started his week in Washington, hosting a who\u2019s who of coronavirus treatment truthers and vaccine skeptics for a panel his office called \u201cCOVID-19: A Second Opinion.\u201dOne day earlier, anti-vaccine activists had marched in the streets of Washington and decried whatever COVID-19 vaccine mandates the country has left. Johnson\u2019s panelists questioned the safety of vaccines and pushed unproven treatments like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin.\u201cI would have liked to see a larger dose of modesty coming out of our federal health officials, legacy media and big tech,\u201d Johnson said Monday. The statement has become his raison-d\u2019etre in Washington, where he has established himself as the Senate\u2019s resident COVID-19 response skeptic. At the panel, the senator shared outdated statistics \u2014 he\u2019s still talking about Sweden\u2019s more lax early response to COVID-19, even though the Scandinavian country now has much stronger vaccine and COVID-19 prevention policies \u2014 and elevated potentially dangerous advice to self-medicate with unproven treatments. By Thursday, he was on conservative activist Charlie Kirk\u2019s show, baselessly and wrongfully claiming that professional athletes were dropping dead on the field because of the COVID-19 vaccines.Johnson blames the mainstream media and big tech (he was briefly suspended from YouTube for spreading COVID-19 misinformation) for censoring him and the fringe medical professionals in his circle. He claims President Joe Biden\u2019s administration and government health officials are part of some big cover-up.The senator has seemingly become so obsessed with his trutherism that he is running for a third term to be a voice for conspiracy theories: \u201cto speak plain and obvious truths other elected leaders shirk from expressing \u2015 truths the elite in government, mainstream media and Big Tech don\u2019t want you to hear,\u201d as he puts it. \u201cSome observers figured he might end his time in the Senate, and that was why he was willing to go out on a limb on so many of these issues,\u201d said Barry Burden, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cHe seems to be genuinely concerned that these fringe ideas about public health and education and elections are not getting enough attention and he wants to be there in Washington to advocate for them.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a cautious incumbent-oriented reelection strategy,\u201d Burden added.\u201cRon Johnson is going to do what the hell he wants.\u201dRepublicans, both in Wisconsin and nationwide, have come to accept that there\u2019s no changing Johnson\u2019s ways. He won his last two elections as an independent voice, even when most outside observers said he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. And he did it largely without the national party\u2019s help.\u201cI\u2019m sure they all have their druthers as to what they\u2019d like to see,\u201d said Brandon Scholz, a Republican strategist in Wisconson, referring to GOP officials at the state and local level. \u201cRon Johnson is going to do what the hell he wants.\u201dThe Republican Party is now deferring to Johnson, according to a national GOP strategist, although they noted that there may be some voices trying to \u201cfocus\u201d him on more kitchen table issues.Johnson\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\u201cYou may have consultants that say it is not a good idea to run a general election campaign on crazy conspiracy theories, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he continues to double down on that,\u201d said Charlie Sykes, a Wisconsin-based political commentator who hosted an influential Milwaukee conservative talk radio show for more than two decades. In 2010, Johnson and Sykes were allies; Johnson credited Sykes with helping him oust Democrat Russ Feingold in an incredible upset election that catapulted Johnson from unknown Republican businessman to a two-term statesman. Sykes, a \u201cNever Trump\u201d-style conservative, said he now hates talking about Johnson.\u201cTrumpism broke his brain,\u201d Sykes said, reflecting that the Wisconsin senator has always had an affinity for conservative talk radio in the state, a platform that has \u201cbecome very open to conspiracy theories.\u201dSo far, Johnson has run in election cycles favorable for Republicans. He rode in on the 2010 tea party wave, and then again with Donald Trump at the top of the ticket in 2016. Johnson, it should be noted, outperformed Trump, even though in both races the national Republican Party didn\u2019t think he had much of a shot. He was against Feingold, a popular incumbent, in 2010, and few thought Trump would win the presidency in 2016.This year, Biden\u2019s favorability ratings have fallen nationally and in Johnson\u2019s home state, and historically the party out of power in the White House has the momentum in midterm elections. Republicans are also vying for the governor\u2019s seat against incumbent Democrat Tony Evers; they\u2019re running Rebecca Kleefisch, who served as lieutenant governor under Gov. Scott Walker.But Johnson, too, is starting out his reelection bid underwater. In November, Marquette University polling found 42% of the electorate had an unfavorable opinion of Johnson. He\u2019s also the only Republican senator running in a state that Biden won in 2020. Put succinctly, the electorate is unhappy \u2014 with elected officials of both parties, the economy and the state of the pandemic. All of it.\u201cTrumpism broke his brain.\u201dIf Johnson were a conventional Republican politician, he\u2019d likely have no issue getting reelected. But he\u2019s betting on conspiracy theories.His COVID-19 trutherism isn\u2019t popular with the general population in Wisconsin either; Charles Franklin, Marquette\u2019s pollster, said around 30% of the population has confidence in Johnson\u2019s coronavirus messaging, compared to roughly 50% who have confidence in Evers.Johnson is talking to a primary voter base, despite not having a primary challenger.\u201cI think he would be in trouble if he was betting on the Trump coalition to turn out OK to guarantee his reelection,\u201d Burden said. \u201cThe Republican coalition is now skewed toward people with lower levels of education. That\u2019s a trend that really accelerated during the Trump years and people with lower levels of education are less likely to vote in non-presidential elections.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s sort of a problem that the Democrats used to have,\u201d he added. \u201cVoters who were harder to turn out in the midterms have now become something of a Republican problem.\u201dThere are some signs of a push and pull in his campaign, between the more conventional Republican small-government, tough-on-crime politics and Johnson\u2019s conspiratorial hobby horses seemingly born out of the depths of right-wing media outlets. Johnson\u2019s first two television ads weren\u2019t about his feelings on COVID-19 or election \u201cfraud,\u201d or a defense of Capitol rioters (all things he seems to enjoy talking about). One was about increasing crime, the Black Lives Matter protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last summer, and undocumented immigrants flooding the borders with imagery of a burning American flag. Another was focused on the withdrawal from Afghanistan and rising inflation.His campaign manager is a veteran of Martha McSally\u2019s failed Senate bid in Arizona and, most recently, the early days of Glenn Youngkin\u2019s successful bid for Virginia\u2019s governorship \u2014 two candidates handpicked by the establishment Republican Party.\u201cThere\u2019s a split between what he\u2019s saying at events and what the advertising is currently running on,\u201d Franklin said. But those tensions aren\u2019t stopping Johnson from making media appearances peddling his lies.\u201cHe is perfectly willing to say these things about COVID that our data shows are not as appealing to the public at large but may have a very positive response on primary voters,\u201d Franklin said.It\u2019s the kind of persona that Democrats are eager to fight against in the 2022 midterm elections. For this reason, Wisconsin\u2019s Senate race is one of the few opportunities Democrats see to increase \u2014 or, at the very least, hold onto \u2014 their majority. \u201cWisconsinites are fed up with Ron Johnson\u2019s self-serving political games at their expense and are going to elect a senator who will actually represent us in Washington,\u201d Philip Shulman, a spokesperson for the Wisconsin Democratic Party, told HuffPost.Democrats, notably, have also focused their attacks on Johnson\u2019s votes on the 2017 Republican tax bill, as well as his push to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The hope is that Johnson\u2019s fringe obsessions will get enough attention on their own, making him a Trump-like villain who will energize Democrats to go to the polls. But Republicans are confident that conservatives in the state \u2014 potentially even those who voted for Biden in 2020 \u2014 aren\u2019t going to be so quick to jump on to whoever the Democrats nominate. Democrats have a packed field of candidates, many of whom are flush with cash. Three names lead the pack: Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes has been at the top, with state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and the Milwaukee Bucks\u2019s owner\u2019s son Alex Lasry as strong contenders. All three are running on platforms fairly similar to Biden\u2019s.Republicans are ready to call them all radicals, and out-of-touch liberals. And they are hoping Kleefisch, their likely nominee for governor, will pull disaffected Republicans back into the party.\u201cThere was a drop off of some suburban Republican women,\u201d Scholz said. \u201cSomebody is gonna say, well, Johnson sounds an awful lot like Donald Trump, and therefore they\u2019re not gonna vote for him. Hold the horses on that. Rebecca Kleefisch is going to be the nominee for the gubernatorial race against Governor Evers. She has got those Republican women locked in. They will be voting Republican. They will not move over their ticket. They will not stay home.\u201d Still, Democrats want to show Johnson is not the same small-business Republican they voted for in 2010.At least one Wisconsin Republican can attest to that. \u201cI remember, there was a time when Ted Cruz was shutting down the federal government and was demagoguing, that Ron Johnson hated Ted Cruz, and thought Ted Cruz was being a really reckless demagogue,\u201d Sykes said of Johnson from the Obama era.\u201cIf this race is a referendum on Ron Johnson, Johnson is in a lot of trouble,\u201d he added. \u201cIf it is a choice between Ron Johnson and a very progressive Democrat, that\u2019s a completely different dynamic and I think that that\u2019s what Republicans are counting on.\u201dReporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPostThe Comfort Inn location just off the interstate has three stars on Yelp, where reviewers noted it had free parking and free breakfast, but poor WiFi. It did well on TripAdvisor too, although one person reported they found a dead roach in the shower.As a staging ground for an alleged seditious conspiracy, however, it was a pretty solid choice. The Comfort Inn Ballston had rooms available for members of the right-wing Oath Keepers organization at a reasonable rate. The hotel\u2019s luggage carts were strong enough to lug the bins of weapons, ammunition and supplies that they wheeled in to prepare for Jan. 6, 2021. Its location right off the ramp to Route 66 eastbound, outside of rush hour, can get you to the U.S. Capitol in a hurry. Critically, it was located in the state of Virginia, where the alleged co-conspirators wouldn\u2019t have to worry about those pesky D.C. gun laws until it was time to take over the federal government. Then the laws wouldn\u2019t matter.The indictment of Oath Keepers founder Elmer Stewart Rhodes III, who was integral to the plot that unfolded in Ballston, on seditious conspiracy charges this month has once again drawn national attention to how supporters of President Donald Trump plotted to help stop the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s election victory on Jan. 6. Even after more than 700 arrests, and the hundreds of potential cases that remain, the latest indictment indicates there is much more we still don\u2019t know about the most high-profile conspiracy case to emerge from the Jan. 6 investigation \u2014 and how much worse things could have been.Part of the Oath Keepers\u2019 conspiracy was standing up \u201cQuick Reaction Forces\u201d (QRFs) just outside of D.C. that were on standby to deliver guns into the capital on Jan. 6. The \u201cbase of operations,\u201d according to the indictment, was the Comfort Inn Ballston, where the North Carolina QRF team leader reserved three rooms: one for their North Carolina team, another for the Arizona QRF team, and the third for the Florida QRF team. The indictment alleges they used those rooms to store and guard the firearms, although the four men on the North Carolina QRF team \u201ckept their rifles ready to go in a vehicle parked in the hotel lot\u201d according to a court filing. \u201cWhile certain Oath Keepers members and affiliates inside of Washington, D.C., breached the Capitol grounds and building, others remained stationed just outside of the city in QRF teams,\u201d the indictment states. \u201cThe QRF teams were prepared to rapidly transfer firearms and other weapons into Washington, D.C., in support of operations aimed at using force to stop the lawful transfer of presidential power.\u201dComfort Inn\u2019s parent company did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the inclusion of surveillance camera photos in court documents indicates it is cooperating with the FBI investigation. A federal magistrate judge in Texas, where Rhodes was arrested, ordered the Oath Keepers founder held until trial this week. \u201cDefendant created, staged, and controlled the QRF as a strategic force to escalate armed violence in support of the Raid upon his request,\u201d wrote the federal magistrate judge.Jessica Watkins, an Oath Keepers member from Ohio, explained ahead of a pro-Trump rally in November that a QRF would consist of \u201cguys outside DC with guns\u201d who were awaiting \u201corders to enter DC under permission from Trump, not a minute sooner.\u201d In a more recent detention memo for Ed Vallejo, who was also ordered held pretrial, prosecutors wrote that he and others \u201cstaged as armed QRF teams across the Potomac River, awaiting deployment \u2014 a deployment which proved unnecessary, because the co-conspirators were able to breach the Capitol with the forces they had on the Capitol grounds.\u201dThe \u201cstack\u201d of Oath Keepers marched up the stairs in formation and breached the Capitol just after 2:30. Vallejo messaged Rhodes that they were \u201cstanding by\u201d at the hotel at 2:38.Court documents don\u2019t indicate much about what happened after that, when the Capitol had been breached without the QRFs being called in. There\u2019s no explicit acknowledgement that any of the three QRFs at the hotel left the facility, and there\u2019s little reference to the specific activities of other groups that Rhodes seemed to allude to on Jan. 6.\u201cWe will have several well equipped QRFs outside DC,\u201d Rhodes wrote on Jan. 6 before leaving his hotel. \u201cAnd there are many, many others, from other groups, who will be watching and waiting on the outside in case of worst case scenarios.\u201dBut there are indications that the hotel wasn\u2019t the only location involved in the plan. There are repeated references to QRF RPs \u2014 rally points \u2014 besides the hotel. Plus there was the plan to ferry guns over by boat, which of course couldn\u2019t be done from a landlocked hotel three miles inland from the Potomac River.Alleged co-conspirator Thomas Caldwell texted someone he thought to be associated with anti-government militia Three Percenters and suggested a plot that involved participants \u201cmore or less be hanging around sipping coffee and maybe scooting on the river a bit and pretending to fish\u201d and then, if things went to \u201cshit,\u201d ferry weapons across the river. \u201cDude! If we had 2 boats, we could ferry across and never drive into D.C. at all!!!!\u201d the feds said he wrote. \u201cPLEASE pass the word among folks you know and see if someone would jump in the middle of this to help,\u201d Caldwell wrote, according to the feds. He messaged other contacts about having someone stand by at a dock ramp \u201cnear the Pentagon.\u201dKelly Meggs, a former car dealership manager who headed Florida\u2019s Oath Keepers chapter, sent a copy of a map showing \u201cQRF rally points\u201d with the message \u201c1 if by land, North side of Lincoln Memorial, 2 if by Sea, Corner of west basin and Ohio is water transport landing!!\u201d In the Jan. 2 \u201cLeadership\u201d chat on messaging app Signal, the North Carolina QRF team leader wrote they had \u201csources in DC working on procuring Boat transportation as we speak.\u201d Jan. 6, 2021, was another busy day for Jay Westcott. The longtime photojournalist and U.S. military veteran works for ARLNow, a local news site in Arlington, Virginia, just across the Potomac River from the nation\u2019s capital. He had a few assignments in the Crystal City section of Arlington that morning, and when he heard the news that Trump supporters were headed to the Capitol, his instincts kicked in. Westcott headed for a spot where he knew he could get a good shot: The U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial, which recreates a famous image of Marines raising the American flag at Iwo Jima during World War II. Located on the edge of Virginia, the memorial is directly across the Potomac from the National Mall, giving visitors a stunning view of the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument and U.S. Capitol lined up in a row. At about 3:30, about an hour after the Capitol was breached, Westcott was at the memorial with his camera. He saw what he felt was a suspicious group of men hanging out at the location. They were using radios; one had an earpiece in. He was vastly outnumbered and didn\u2019t want a confrontation, so he shot some photos from a distance.\u201cIt is a straight line of sight three miles to the Capitol building,\u201d he said. \u201cThe radios that they had were very capable of getting there.\u201d He also noted that not only was the location closer to the Capitol, but it had different route options.\u201cThe thing about that location is you have access to every major road into D.C. just from that one spot,\u201d he said. \u201cA quick reaction force with a lead foot, they could\u2019ve been in the Capitol building in less than 10 minutes.\u201d A year ago, Westcott reached out to the FBI. Then, a few months after the Capitol attack, in March 2021, ARLNow published a story that featured several of Westcott\u2019s photos with the faces of the men blurred out. Westcott was also in touch with some of the online sleuths investigating the Capitol attack, but nothing emerged that definitively identified the men or linked them to the broader Oath Keepers conspiracy, or figured out precisely how they fit into the puzzle.But he says no one from the FBI got in contact with him after he reached out or after the story ran, and he wonders why they wouldn\u2019t want this potential lead.\u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything. I\u2019ve heard zero,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievably frustrating to know that I have hard evidence, tangible physical evidence that shows details, that shows faces, and that the government and FBI have the technology to take advantage of that and haven\u2019t.\u201d  The FBI declined to comment on the ongoing investigation into the QRFs. But there are a few potential explanations for what\u2019s happening. Bureaucracy could play a role: The massive scope of the Jan. 6 attack is overwhelming, and plenty of rock-solid tips have been overlooked in a sea of hundreds of thousands of tips that flooded into the FBI after Jan. 6. The FBI could also already know who was in the group at the memorial and don\u2019t need the photos. There\u2019s also the possibility that the FBI concluded there wasn\u2019t enough to open or sustain an investigation: Apart from the context of Jan. 6, the bureau would not be investigating a group of men hanging in a public park. The men were in Virginia, and didn\u2019t display any weapons anyway, so it would take a more definitive link to tie them to a broader criminal conspiracy.A number of surveillance images have been released in court filings, but there\u2019s nothing that ties the group to the broader conspiracy. The current acting president of the Oath Keepers said that she doesn\u2019t recognize the men featured in the photos at the memorial.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s them,\u201d Kellye Sorelle, the acting president of the Oath Keepers, told HuffPost of the photos posted on ARLNow. \u201cNobody recognized them.\u201dSorelle, whose phone was seized by the FBI in September as part of the Oath Keepers investigation, said she had \u201cno earthly idea\u201d if Rhodes was in contact with other \u201cQRF\u201d groups besides those stationed at the hotel in the days surrounding Jan. 6. (Sorelle, as BuzzFeed News first reported, has denied Rhodes\u2019 claim that he was in a relationship with her and had lived with her since May 2020. Sorelle previously said that Rhodes only \u201coccasionally\u201d stayed with her when he was in the area, and told BuzzFeed News that Rhodes probably only claimed a relationship after his arrest because he \u201cwas wanting to get released to my house.\u201d)Westcott, meanwhile, is just hoping his photos can be helpful in the ongoing probe. Nearly 11 months after blurred-out versions of Westcott\u2019s photos were published, he\u2019s willing to provide the photos, while acknowledging the tension between his work as a photojournalist and what he sees as his patriotic duty.\u201cIt\u2019s a sticky situation to be in. On one hand, as a journalist I have a responsibility to protect my notes and raw files as protected under the First Amendment,\u201d Westcott said. But, he added, it was important to him to find out if they were indeed part of broader plot by right-wing groups who \u201cwant to throw the First Amendment away,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they had succeeded, there wouldn\u2019t be a First Amendment to protect anymore.\u201d Westcott worked at the Capitol for 10 years, and its breach had a major impact on him.\u201cI know all those tunnels, I know all the little staircases, I\u2019ve been to every place you could possibly be in that Capitol building,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen that building was breached, I felt violated, I felt personally violated. I have friends who were put in harm\u2019s way, people who are dear to me were put in harm\u2019s way.\u201d\u201cThere have to be consequences.\u201dSenior Justice Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Overnight Editor, HuffPostBefore Pink Floyd became one of the world\u2019s biggest stadium acts from the 1970s through the 1990s, the band had some much smaller \u2015 and far stranger \u2015 public appearances. One of its first U.S. television appearances was a surreal performance on Dick Clark\u2019s \u201cAmerican Bandstand\u201d in 1967, in which the band mimed its way though the song \u201cApples and Oranges.\u201d New restored footage by Swedish artist Alex Stubbe Teglbj\u00e6rg, a.k.a. Artist on the border, shows how the band at the time \u2015 Syd Barrett on guitar and vocals, Roger Waters on bass, Rick Wright on keyboards and Nick Mason on drums \u2015 didn\u2019t exactly crank up the enthusiasm. But what most stood out was the indifferent appearance of Barrett, the band\u2019s increasingly troubled leader who was slowly being consumed by his struggles with both drug use and mental illness: With a full-time job and a family, Teglbj\u00e6rg completed his work mostly at night, colorizing the video one frame at a time using a free AI tool called HotPot.ai, then correcting and sharpening each one, including hand-painted adjustments: \u201cIt\u2019s very meditative work,\u201d he said via email. Teglbj\u00e6rg, who is a graphic designer and Pink Floyd fan, has posted a number of projects related to the band on YouTube. One of his efforts even received a thumbs-up from Pink Floyd\u2019s drummer. Teglbj\u00e6rg also works locally with the Swedish Syd Barrett cover band Men on the Border. But his effort on the \u201cApple and Oranges\u201d video was a labor of love after seeing the original low-quality black-and-white footage online and thinking: \u201cThis can be so much better.\u201d The result is a glimpse into one of the band\u2019s biggest turning points. About a month after the \u201cAmerican Bandstand\u201d appearance, Barrett would film a promotional video with the band for \u201cJugband Blues,\u201d one of his final recorded acts with Pink Floyd:Barrett, who became increasingly erratic and unreliable, made his last live appearance with the band in January 1968, and was out of the group by April of that year. \u201cHe would lead the band to its first precarious fame and damage himself irreparably along the way,\u201d the band\u2019s website notes. \u201cAnd though the Floyd\u2019s Barrett era only lasted three years, it always informed what they became.\u201d Guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour would join the band in late 1967, working briefly alongside Barrett before ultimately replacing him.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Florida Republicans want to forbid discussions of sexual orientation or gender identity in schools with a bill that activists say endangers children and echoes a previous wave of laws that sought to squelch LGBTQ conversations in the classroom.Activists have dubbed the proposal moving through Florida\u2019s GOP-controlled Statehouse as the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, and it has attracted condemnation on social media and from Chasten Buttigieg, the husband of Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.If passed, the measure would \u201ceffectively silence students from speaking about their LGBTQ family members, friends, neighbors and icons,\u201d said Kara Gross of the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.The bill emerged amid a national debate over how U.S. schools should teach about race, gender and history. The broad reexamination of public education has often turned contentious and led to books being pulled from school library shelves.As written, the proposal states that school districts \u201cmay not encourage classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity in primary grade levels or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students.\u201d A parent could sue a district for violations.In a committee hearing last week, Democrats peppered bill sponsor Rep. Joe Harding with questions about whether kids would be able to talk freely about LGBTQ people or history.Harding repeatedly said his bill is meant to give parents more control over what their children learn. He maintained that it would not silence spontaneous discussions but instead stop a district from integrating such topics into the curriculum. He added that schools could still have lessons on Pride Month and events such as the 2016 Pulse nightclub massacre in which a gunman killed 49 people in Orlando.\u201cThis doesn\u2019t preclude discussion and conversation that\u2019s going to happen. We\u2019re talking about a school district initiating something through a standard procedure or policy that they\u2019re doing,\u201d he said.Critics said Harding\u2019s statements contradicted the broad text of his bill, particularly in terms of having lessons on LGBTQ history, which they argued would be barred from the curriculum. They also said the proposal does not specify what grades would be affected. Harding said it would apply to students in kindergarten through fifth grade.\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of clarity clearly on what this bill is seeking to do. But what we do know is that LGBTQ people are a normal, healthy part of our society,\u201d Jon Harris Maurer, public policy director of Equality Florida, told lawmakers at the hearing. \u201cWe\u2019re parents, students and teachers. We are your brothers and your sisters. Conversations about us aren\u2019t something dangerous that should be banned.\u201dAaron DiPietro, legislative director for the conservative Florida Family Policy Council, spoke in support of the measure, telling the committee: \u201cThese are issues that parents need to be involved in.\u201dThe bill passed the GOP-controlled committee and now heads to another committee. After the hearing, state Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, a Democrat who is gay, posted a video to social media criticizing the proposal.\u201cWe should and we are encouraging these types of conversations in our schools,\u201d he said.A similar bill introduced by a Republican state senator has yet to have a hearing.The Florida proposal has echoes of a cluster of state laws passed mostly in the late 1980s and early 1990s to restrict discussions of LGBTQ issues in public schools.In Utah, the restrictions banning \u201cadvocacy of homosexuality\u201d in sex education and elsewhere affected kids for years, according to a 2017 lawsuit. They hamstrung one school\u2019s response to bullying after a 7-year-old boy was beaten and burned on a hot metal slide because the laws prevented teachers from telling other kids it was OK to be gay or wear girls\u2019 clothes, his mother said in court papers.A school district also pulled a book about a lesbian couple raising children from library shelves under those rules.In another case, a boy was told he could not do a family-history project on an uncle who was gay, said Clifford Rosky, a law professor at the University of Utah whose research formed the basis of the lawsuit.\u201cAny child or any student whose parent is a member of that group feels stigmatized, like the law stigmatizes their family,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw this very dramatically in Utah.\u201dUtah changed the law in response to the lawsuit, as have other states such as Arizona, South Carolina and Alabama.Rosky said the Florida measure \u201chas a greater discriminatory effect and a greater chilling effect, because it\u2019s up to every individual parent to enforce the law,\u201d he said.The bill \u201cwould make teachers fearful of providing a safe, inclusive classroom,\u201d said Julie Wilensky, senior staff attorney at the National Center for Lesbian Rights. \u201cIt would really harm LGBTQ students and families, and it would stigmatize them by suggesting there\u2019s something so shameful or dangerous about LGBTQ people that they can\u2019t be discussed at school.\u201dLarge majorities of LGBTQ kids in Florida reported hearing homophobic remarks in school in a 2019 survey, and 69% reported being verbally harassed based on sexual orientation.Last year, a handful of states passed new laws requiring parents to be notified about any discussions of LGBTQ issues in schools and allowing them to opt out. Those states included Tennessee, Arkansas and Montana, where the law has a broadly written in reference to \u201chuman sexuality education.\u201d A similar measure was vetoed in Arizona.It was part of a record year for anti-LGBT bills, with 26 enacted in 10 states, according to Human Rights Campaign. This year, less than a month into many legislative sessions, the LGBT-rights group is opposing at least 200 bills.___Whitehurst contributed from Salt Lake City.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Ron Johnson (R-WI) falsely tells Charlie Kirk that there have been 22,000 deaths associated with coronavirus vaccines and that \"all these athletes are dropping dead on the field.\" (???) pic.twitter.com/6RK6ho6y36Then Johnson repeated a persistent conspiracy theory from anti-vaccine activists that professional athletes are literally dropping dead on the field because of the COVID-19 vaccine.\u201cThe Faucis of the world are just blowing it all off, the Biden administration [says] nothing to see here,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOf course we\u2019ve heard story after story, I mean, all these athletes dropping dead on the field. But we are supposed to ignore that.\u201dThis claim, which has been spread online through misleading videos, has been repeatedly debunked. \u201cPrevious lists of athletes who purportedly died from the COVID-19 vaccines have included people who hadn\u2019t died or hadn\u2019t gotten the vaccine,\u201d according to Politifact, which fact-checked the claim again this week after NBA All-Star John Stockton repeated it in an interview with his hometown newspaper. \u201cThere have been no official reports linking the vaccines to heart issues in athletes, and multiple sports cardiologists have called the claims unfounded.\u201dCOVID-19 conspiracies are familiar territory for Johnson, who is running for reelection in Wisconsin this year.He started his week in Washington, D.C., hosting a panel of fringe medical professionals and experts who downplayed the importance of social distancing and mask-wearing, and embraced untested and unproven home remedies like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin. (The impacts of ivermectin on COVID-19 are still under going clinical trial.)Johnson, who himself has refused to get vaccinated, has repeatedly put life-saving public health messaging at risk, questioning why Americans need to get vaccinated en masse.While much of the country has gotten vaccinated against COVID-19, the United States is still struggling with vaccine hesitancy in some areas. Between October and November of last year, the CDC found an unvaccinated person had 14 times the risk of infection compared to a fully vaccinated person who had received a booster dose. Unvaccinated people had 53.2 times the risk of COVID-associated death.Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Politics Reporter, HuffPostAt 11:20 a.m. Monday, an editor for the right-wing Daily Caller tweeted out a link to a radio interview with a woman from Loudoun County, Virginia, who claimed her child was being \u201cstrong-armed and intimidated by his principal and many others\u201d for refusing to wear a face mask at school.The interview was pegged to a major news event: Gov. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s executive order making masks optional in Virginia\u2019s public schools, which went into effect Monday \u2014 and the lawsuit by seven districts challenging its legality. Loudoun is one county that is still requiring students to mask up in classrooms as the issue is settled in the courts.The tweet linking to the interview with the frustrated parent eventually reached former Donald Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who retweeted it to his 100,000 followers.Ned Ryun, the CEO of American Majority, the national group that trains conservative political candidates, tweeted that Loudoun County\u2019s school board is \u201cout of control\u201d and is \u201cbasically threatening kids with suspension if they do not wear masks in schools. We need to make sure that there are consequences for these people.\u201dA GOP House Ways and Means Committee staffer tweeted around 1 p.m. that he \u201cjust got a heads up that Loudoun County schools are punishing kids who won\u2019t wear masks by putting them in the equivalent of a rubber room without access to instruction. Teachers insisting kids wear masks regardless of the governor\u2019s order and saying wait until SCOTUS decision.\u201dConservative pundits Hugh Hewitt and Guy Benson also jumped on the case.Hewitt linked to his interview Monday with Youngkin, who offered an email address for \u201cparents facing reprisals like this policy for LSC.\u201dBenson linked to a local news article that quoted a high school principal echoing the district\u2019s policy about virtual learning in the auditorium for maskless students.The same article noted that \u201cwhile many walked in without masks, more complied with the school system\u2019s rule.\u201dThe Loudoun county school board is out of control. Basically threatening kids with suspension if they do not wear masks in schools. We need to make sure that there are consequences for these people.Other than the flurry of tweets from GOP operatives, there\u2019s been no evidence of mass chaos or suspensions over the competing mask orders \u2014 just endless parental squabbling.A district spokesperson told HuffPost that about 200 students have arrived at school without a mask, and most ended up wearing one and going to class. That\u2019s out of more than 82,000 students.The chain of events on Monday demonstrates how the right has wielded the anger around COVID protocols and school curriculums for political gain.In this case, a call to a radio show from a woman in Virginia spread nationally to top conservative pundits in just a few hours. But it became a bad game of telephone, growing more distorted as it quickly circulated.Loudoun County has become a national case study for debates over whether students should have to wear masks at school \u2014 and also how they should learn about racism in the U.S.That\u2019s made the school district a target for fearmongering. Last year, Republicans, including Youngkin, alleged that a \u201cgender fluid\u201d boy, enabled by the district\u2019s inclusive bathroom policy, had sexually assaulted a female student in the girls\u2019 bathroom. But there was never any evidence linking the attack to the bathroom policy.There was more controversy this month when Youngkin announced that one of his first executive orders would make masks in schools optional, setting off a debate about whether that\u2019s the purview of the governor or of individual school boards.In the interim, Youngkin has urged parents to remain calm and follow orders.\u201cI urge everyone to love your neighbor, to listen to school principals, and to trust the legal process,\u201d he tweeted last week.The spokesperson for Loudoun schools described the interim mask policy in an email to HuffPost:\u201cStudents who are not wearing a mask will be asked to wear one. If they do not have a mask, one will be provided to them. If a student refuses to wear a mask, staff will meet with the student and contact their parent/guardian to discuss and identify the reason the student will not comply. If non-compliance is related to a medical or financial need, the school-based team will develop a plan of action to support the student in following the requirement.Our protocol for students that refused to follow the school division\u2019s mitigation protocol was to send them to a common area, such as the auditorium, where they could access the Schoology platform to continue their school work. They were encouraged to email teachers if they had questions and teachers stopped by throughout the day to help students as their schedule allowed. Bathroom breaks were given to the students as well as setting up special lunch periods to make sure they were fed.\u201dIn other words, there\u2019s no \u201crubber room without access to instruction.\u201dBut what parent activist Megan Rafalski described to radio hosts on WMAL sounded like a version of that. She choked back tears describing what the district\u2019s mask mandate has done to her elementary schooler. She claimed her son was sequestered in the principal\u2019s office and that she was forced to wait for him outside in the cold.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m going to try to keep it together,\u201d Rafalski told the hosts of \u201cO\u2019Connor and Company,\u201d \u201cbut we\u2019ve gotten to a point \u2014 it\u2019s unbelievable what they\u2019re doing to our kids. They won\u2019t let my son go to his classroom because he won\u2019t wear a mask, because he\u2019s exercising his rights, and they\u2019re forcing him to sit in the office. He\u2019s been strong-armed and intimidated by his principal and many others.\u201dShe later told Loudoun Now that her son was \u201cclinically dismissed\u201d from school at noon over his refusal to wear a mask. The district spokesperson told HuffPost it doesn\u2019t comment on individual students.Rafalski isn\u2019t just a random parent \u2014 she\u2019s the face of the district\u2019s anti-mask movement. That\u2019s earned her guest appearances on Fox News alongside her family to argue that masks are \u201cdepriving the children of oxygen [for] their brain to be able to develop properly.\u201dThere is, of course, no evidence that masks do that.Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Latifah, who executive produces and stars in CBS\u2019s crime procedural, broke her silence over a month after Noth\u2019s abrupt dismissal from the series following the allegations, which he continues to deny.\u201cIt\u2019s still surreal. It is such a dicey, delicate situation that requires a great deal of respect,\u201d she told People in a video interview on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s a personal thing that he\u2019s going to have to deal with.\u201dLatifah acknowledged how Noth\u2019s role \u2015 a former CIA handler and old friend of her character \u2015 is \u201cobviously a big part of the show\u201d and praised their \u201camazing chemistry.\u201d But, ultimately, she said, \u201cMy feeling is justice has to prevail regardless. I just want the right things to be done, you know?\u201dAs for how the series, which is currently in the middle of filming its second season, will address Noth\u2019s exit, Latifah added, \u201dWe are figuring out what we want to do creatively on the show and how we\u2019re going to deal with that character.\u201dDays after the accusations surfaced, CBS fired Noth from the series, stating that the actor \u201cwill no longer film additional episodes of \u2018The Equalizer,\u2019 effective immediately.\u201d Noth, however, will be seen in one upcoming episode of the series, which was filmed before the allegations surfaced. In a Hollywood Reporter piece published in December, two women came forward with claims that Noth sexually assaulted them on separate occasions in 2004 and 2015. One woman, who used the pseudonym Zoe, said that Noth raped her at his Los Angeles apartment when she was 22. Since then, several other women have shared similar allegations.The actor was subsequently dropped from his talent agency and his much-buzzed-about Peloton ad was scrapped, along with his appearance in the upcoming season finale of the \u201cSex and the City\u201d sequel series \u201cAnd Just Like That ... \u201d.Noth has repeatedly denied the claims, calling them \u201ccategorically false\u201d in a statement he made after the allegations first surfaced.\u201cThese stories could\u2019ve been from 30 years ago or 30 days ago \u2014 no always means no \u2014 that is a line I did not cross,\u201d he told The Hollywood Reporter at the time. \u201cThe encounters were consensual.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostSen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) on Tuesday became the latest Republican lawmaker to seek credit for the bipartisan infrastructure overhaul he opposed in Congress.After joining U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials for a tour of the Herbert Hoover Dike, which stands to benefit from investments in the law dedicated to making the Everglades more resilient against climate change, Scott said he was \u201cproud\u201d to help secure \u201can unprecedented $1 billion for Everglades restoration, the largest single amount ever allocated by the federal government.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m working to make sure that every dollar of this funding will go toward the most critical projects that build on our restoration efforts and provide a good return on investment for Floridians and all American taxpayers,\u201d Scott added in a statement issued by his office.His office also released several photos of Scott shaking hands and posing with local officials near the earthen dam that surrounds Lake Okeechobee. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration announced last week that $1.1 billion would be allocated to Everglades restoration as part of the recently passed Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The measure passed in the Senate in a broad, bipartisan vote of 69-30.But Scott, who served as governor of Florida before heading off to Washington, wasn\u2019t among the senators who voted aye. \u201cWe have to stop this reckless spending and live within our means. This bill is not paid for, and that\u2019s wrong,\u201d Scott said last year ahead of the bill\u2019s passage. The $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package is projected to add $256 billion to the federal deficit over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Many Republicans supported the bill anyway, arguing that CBO\u2019s score didn\u2019t accurately reflect the real-world budgetary effect of infrastructure spending. Late last year, Scott said party donors were \u201cfurious\u201d with those Republicans who voted for the law, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).A request for comment with Scott\u2019s office was not immediately returned. Scott isn\u2019t the only GOP lawmaker touting funding in the infrastructure law after voting against the bill, though he appears to be the first senator to do so. Reps. Ashley Hinson (Iowa), Kay Granger (Texas), Steve Scalise (La.) and Clay Higgins (La.) did the same. They have sought to explain their reversal by noting they support parts of the law, but not all of it. The White House, meanwhile, has embraced those lawmakers who are now singing the law\u2019s praises even though they voted against it last year. \u201cWe welcome their support for the president\u2019s agenda,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a Monday press briefing.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostTaylor Alison Swift, one of the most decorated singer-songwriters and best-selling musicians of all time, would like to issue a correction.The artist came to her own defense on Monday after a fellow musician, Damon Albarn, was quoted in the Los Angeles Times taking a dig at Swift that, as anyone who\u2019s followed her nearly 20-year career is likely aware, is categorically false: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t write her own songs,\u201d the 53-year-old British musician quipped when the Times music critic commended Swift\u2019s songwriting prowess. Swift, 32, responded on Twitter, identifying herself as a onetime fan of Albarn\u2019s before issuing a dressing-down worthy of one of her best diss tracks. \u201cYour hot take is completely false and SO damaging. You don\u2019t have to like my songs but it\u2019s really fucked up to try and discredit my writing,\u201d wrote Swift, who has a CVS-receipt-length list of songwriting credits to her name and the accolades to prove it. @DamonAlbarn I was such a big fan of yours until I saw this. I write ALL of my own songs. Your hot take is completely false and SO damaging. You don\u2019t have to like my songs but it\u2019s really fucked up to try and discredit my writing. WOW. https://t.co/t6GyXBU2JdLike anyone who\u2019s been in the spotlight for most of their life, Swift has earned some criticism: for her onetime aversion to talking politics, for some slut-shaming lyrics on old albums, for fetishizing African colonialism in a music video. Some might call her dance moves cringeworthy. But criticizing her for not being a songwriter? Let\u2019s review. In 2004, at the age of 14, Swift struck a songwriting deal and became the youngest person ever signed to Sony/ATV Music Publishing. Then, in 2007, a teenage Swift became the youngest person ever honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association as songwriter/artist of the year. In 2010, the Songwriters Hall of Fame presented her with the Hal David Starlight Award highlighting young songwriters. In 2015, she became the youngest person ever recognized on Rolling Stone\u2019s list of the 100 greatest songwriters of all time. She is \u201ca songwriting savant,\u201d Rolling Stone acknowledged years early, in 2008. Swift is credited as a songwriter or co-songwriter on all of her 11 albums. She famously wrote her third studio album, Speak Now, without any co-writers as a direct response to people who denied she could do it. \u201cI\u2019ve had several upheavals in my career. When I was 18, they were like, \u2018She doesn\u2019t really write those songs.\u2019 So my third album I wrote by myself as a reaction to that,\u201d Swift told Rolling Stone in 2019. Perhaps more than any other artist of her generation, Swift is known for producing songs recounting her most personal life experiences and relationships (and her harshest critics won\u2019t let you forget it.) If someone else were covertly writing these songs, it might be one of the greatest cons in the history of the music industry. An hour after Swift responded to the interview, Albarn issued a tweet apologizing. But he blamed the Times for its framing, saying that he and pop music critic Mikael Wood \u201chad a conversation about songwriting and sadly it was reduced to clickbait.\u201d The interview, which was published in a question-and-answer format, doesn\u2019t give Albarn\u2019s claim much credence. Here\u2019s how he responded when Wood corrected him about Swift\u2019s songwriting. Wood: Of course she does. Co-writes some of them.Albarn: That doesn\u2019t count. I know what co-writing is. Co-writing is very different to writing. I\u2019m not hating on anybody, I\u2019m just saying there\u2019s a big difference between a songwriter and a songwriter who co-writes. Doesn\u2019t mean that the outcome can\u2019t be really great. And some of the greatest singers \u2014 I mean, Ella Fitzgerald never wrote a song in her life. When I sing, I have to close my eyes and just be in there. I suppose I\u2019m a traditionalist in that sense. A really interesting songwriter is Billie Eilish and her brother. I\u2019m more attracted to that than to Taylor Swift. It\u2019s just darker \u2014 less endlessly upbeat. Way more minor and odd. I think she\u2019s exceptional.Swift probably wouldn\u2019t call her sob-inducing, 10-minute version of \u201cAll Too Well (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d an \u201cendlessly upbeat\u201d song, but the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate.And there\u2019s one more thing she\u2019d like to add to the record.

The CDC study noted that among 1.2 million fully vaccinated people, 36 died after contracting COVID-19 \u2015 and 28 of those had at least four risk factors.Rodgers has spread misleading and false information before about the vaccine, and he\u2019s proudly noted that he sought medical advice from podcast comedian Joe Rogan, who also has spread misinformation.General Assignment Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The same one he has blown for years.I want to personally thank Mitch McConnellHe just mobilized the biggest African American voter turnout for MidtermsIt\u2019s true that turnout in the 2020 presidential election set an all-time record. Census data shows that in the 2020 election, Black voter turnout was only a few percentage points lower than general turnout among all eligible American voters.But that does not mean the same will hold true for future elections, given how many state legislatures have been working to change how their elections are conducted, make it more difficult to vote, and make it easier to flip the outcome.Last year, the Justice Department sued the state of Georgia over new voting restrictions, accusing lawmakers of unlawfully targeting Black voters. In North Carolina, a panel of judges struck down a voter identification law last fall after finding it was \u201cmotivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters.\u201dOver the course of 2021, 19 states enacted laws making it harder for people to vote, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

The organization has an online map showing their locations. Shortly after the insurrection, McCarthy said that Trump \u201cbears responsibility\u201d for the attack, which was carried out by his supporters as they attempted to block the certification of the 2020 election.\u201cNo if, ands or buts,\u201d McCarthy said in January 2021. He quickly changed his tune, not only publicly absolving Trump of blame but also traveling to Mar-a-Lago to curry favor. Since then, McCarthy has attempted to block and stymie investigations into the Jan. 6 assault, and has refused to cooperate after being asked to testify by the House select committee handling the probe.\u201cWhat are you hiding, Kevin McCarthy?\u201d the ads ask. That\u2019s not the only ad about the U.S. Capitol attack generating attention. The progressive PAC MeidasTouch will run a spot on Fox News on Sunday to remind viewers that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) called the Jan. 6 rioters who assaulted the Capitol \u201cterrorists.\u201dThat\u2019s a no-no on Fox News, which has frequently aired discredited conspiracy theories about the attack. Cruz later apologized on-air for using the word. MeidasTouch wants viewers to know Cruz has used the term correctly and repeatedly: BREAKING: Fox has accepted our ad buy using Ted Cruz\u2019s own words to call January 6th what it was: a terrorist attack.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostThe CIA has found that the majority of mysterious \u201cHavana Syndrome\u201d cases reported to the government are unlikely to have resulted from efforts by hostile foreign powers, a U.S. government official told HuffPost following reports by other news outlets on Thursday. The interim assessment, however, concluded that a couple dozen cases require more study to evaluate possible foreign involvement. Several hundred U.S. diplomats, spies and other government personnel have complained of debilitating and unexplained symptoms, which generally include migraine headaches and nausea after hearing strange noises, beginning with State Department staff at the American embassy in Cuba in 2016.A targeted energy weapon \u2015 perhaps using microwaves \u2015 was speculated to be the culprit, although others say that\u2019s unlikely based on current scientific advancements. Another theory posits that it could be a mass psychogenic illness, or \u201cmass hysteria,\u201d causing the symptoms. \u201cDespite extensive investigation, we have so far not found evidence of state actor involvement in any incident. Taking into account all of the intelligence we have collected and reviewed at this point, we assess it is unlikely that a foreign actor, including Russia, is conducting a sustained, worldwide campaign harming U.S. personnel with a weapon or mechanism,\u201d the U.S. official said. The majority of known cases can be \u201creasonably explained\u201d by undiagnosed medical conditions or environmental factors, said the official.But the CIA is continuing to investigate two dozen cases and has not ruled out the possibility of foreign involvement for those. That set includes many of the original patients who complained of mysterious medical ailments in Havana six years ago, according to NBC News. Victims of Havana Syndrome faced skepticism by officials during the administration of President Donald Trump, who displayed unusual deference to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The U.S. official stressed that CIA Director William Burns, installed by President Joe Biden last year, is committed to protecting the health and well-being of agency personnel. Burns said in a statement that his agency is \u201cpursuing this complex issue with analytic rigor, sound tradecraft, and compassion and have dedicated intensive resources to this challenge.\u201d\u201cWhile we have reached some significant interim findings, we are not done. We will continue the mission to investigate these incidents and provide access to world-class care for those who need it,\u201d Burns said.A significant number of other cases also do not have tidy explanations, an official told The New York Times. Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner (D-Va.) emphasized that efforts to get to the bottom of the maladies are ongoing. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that today\u2019s assessment, while rigorously conducted, reflects only the interim work of the CIA task force,\u201d Warner said in a statement. He added that his committee will \u201ccontinue pressing for answers on a bipartisan basis\u201d alongside the intelligence community and an \u201coutside experts panel that has been assembled to seek answers to these very urgent and difficult questions.\u201dHouse Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) called the CIA\u2019s report \u201ca first step\u201d toward answering questions about Havana Syndrome, but \u201cfar from the last.\u201d U.S. diplomats, intelligence officers, staff and military personnel have complained of Havana Syndrome-like symptoms in Austria, China, India, Russia, Columbia \u2015 and even in Washington, D.C. The onset of two staffers\u2019 mysterious health complaints delayed Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 trip to Vietnam last year. Aside from headaches and nausea, some victims experience memory loss and cognitive impairments that sometimes make it impossible to do their jobs.In early October, Biden signed legislation to compensate Havana Syndrome victims and ensure they have access to proper medical care. \u201cWe are bringing to bear the full resources of the U.S. government to make available first-class medical care to those affected and to get to the bottom of these incidents, including to determine the cause and who is responsible,\u201d the president said at the time.

In a live chat Michael Protzman -48 talks about the Trump rally and explains that Kari Lake was endorsed by JFK and that JFK was disguised as Trump. pic.twitter.com/KbMTAbvT6BHowever, Ron Watkins, who many people believe started the QAnon movement, claimed there was no body double at the rally \u2015 just Trump.Ron is in a live chat and was just asked if it was the real Trump at the rally. pic.twitter.com/LchVQqbhkVKennedy wasn\u2019t the only dead celebrity supposedly supporting Trump\u2019s baseless claims of election fraud in Arizona, as one of Protzman\u2019s followers also claimed he saw Tupac Shakur and Kobe Bryant.A lot of QAnons look for anything that can prove their theories and beliefs. Here we have some who believe these two people were JFK and Carolyn. While Pryme Minister who is a part of -48 group posted a picture saying he saw Tupac and Kobe Bryant behind Trump. pic.twitter.com/GWWdAqNh7DQAnon has claimed a connection to Kennedy before, previously suggesting that he and his son John F.

I know that you\u2019re not, and I know that it wasn\u2019t that you weren\u2019t trying to see [our son] Valentino, it\u2019s that you weren\u2019t trying to see me.\u201dLater, she indicated that she had misdirected many of her frustrations with co-parenting during the pandemic at Artemiev rather than the situation. \u201cEveryone had COVID,\u201d she explained. \u201cI had no help at all whatsoever. And my friend was out and saw Peter out and Peter was saying something along the lines of, \u2018That bitch won\u2019t let me see my son.\u2019 And when that was relayed to me \u2026 my blood boiled. I just snapped.\u201dArtemiev and Fox got married in 2018 after about a month of dating, according to Entertainment Tonight Canada. They announced the birth of son Valentino in February of last year. In June, they were photographed with their baby at the Tribeca Film Festival premiere of \u201cNo Sudden Move.\u201d It\u2019s unclear when they formally split. Fox has been the subject of intense media speculation after she was spotted on a date with Kanye West on New Year\u2019s Day. Less than a week later, she confirmed her new relationship with a series of steamy photographs in Interview magazine. In an essay accompanying the spread, she revealed that the rapper \u2015 who changed his name to Ye last fall \u2015 had surprised her with \u201can entire hotel suite full of clothes\u201d after taking her to see a performance of \u201cSlave Play\u201d on Broadway. \u201cEverything with us has been so organic,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t know where things are headed but if this is any indication of the future I\u2019m loving the ride.\u201d Fox\u2019s acting career appears to be in high gear once again, too. Last week, she met with Madonna to discuss the pop superstar\u2019s long-gestating biopic. Fox is reportedly in talks to play Debi Mazar, the \u201cGoodFellas\u201d and \u201cYounger\u201d star who has been Madonna\u2019s confidante since the early 1980s.

Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a Trump ally, to appear before the committee, but Jordan rejected that request.In May, when asked by a CNN reporter whether he would be willing to testify about Jan. 6, McCarthy replied: \u201cSure.\u201dBut late Wednesday evening, McCarthy released a statement calling the committee \u201cillegitimate\u201d and designed to advance the political objectives of Democrats \u2015 even though two Republicans, including the vice chair, are members of it.\u201cAs a representative and the leader of the minority party, it is with neither regret nor satisfaction that I have concluded to not participate with this select committee\u2019s abuse of power that stains this institution today and will harm it going forward,\u201d McCarthy said in his statement.Thompson\u2019s letter describes McCarthy\u2019s statements on the day of the attack, when he told CBS News: \u201cI was very clear with the president when I called him. This has to stop and he has to go to the American public and tell them to stop this.\u201dIt further lays out what McCarthy told Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.), who later released her own statement detailing that conversation. The statement reads: \u201cWhen McCarthy finally reached the president on January 6 and asked him to publicly and forcefully call off the riot, the president initially repeated the falsehood that it was antifa that had breached the Capitol. McCarthy refuted that and told the president that these were Trump supporters. That\u2019s when, according to McCarthy, the president said: \u2018Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.\u2019\u201dThompson\u2019s letter says the committee wants to know why McCarthy, in spite of all that, continued to push Trump\u2019s false claims of election fraud and his attempt to block President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s election certification that day. \u201cThe select committee wishes to question you regarding communications you may have had with President Trump, President Trump\u2019s legal team, Representative Jordan, and others at the time on that topic.\u201dPer Thompson\u2019s letter, the committee also wants to know about Trump\u2019s frame of mind in the days following Jan. 6. It cites a previously unreported text message that Fox News host Laura Ingraham sent to Mark Meadows, Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff, on Jan. 12, 2021, as an example: \u201cRemarks on camera discouraging protest at state capit[o]ls esp with weapons will be well advised given how hot the situation is. [E]veryone needs to calm down and pray for our country and for those who lost their lives last week.\u201dThompson noted that McCarthy visited Trump at his social club in Palm Beach, Florida, just weeks after Jan. 6. \u201cYour public statements regarding January 6th have changed markedly since you met with Trump,\u201d Thompson wrote. \u201cAt that meeting, or at any other time, did President Trump or his representatives discuss or suggest what you should say publicly, during the impeachment trial (if called as a witness), or in any later investigation about your conversations with him on January 6th?\u201dThompson closed by pointing out that McCarthy has previously said he was willing to help the investigation. \u201cA full and accurate accounting of what happened on January 6th is critical to the Select Committee\u2019s legislative recommendations,\u201d Thompson wrote. \u201cAnd the American people deserve to understand all the relevant details.\u201dTrump, who lost the 2020 presidential election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College, became the first president in more than two centuries of U.S. elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. The Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol \u2015 which Trump incited in a last-ditch attempt to remain in office \u2015 resulted in five deaths, including that of a police officer, as well as injuries to another 140 officers and four police suicides.Despite this, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024.Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostThe Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday kicked off the first nominations hearing of the year with a message for Republicans: We\u2019re moving forward with one of President Joe Biden\u2019s court picks without your consent, and it\u2019s because you did this to us.Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) scheduled the hearing for Andre Mathis, Biden\u2019s pick for a lifetime seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. Durbin acknowledged that both of Mathis\u2019 home-state senators, Tennessee GOP Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty, oppose his nomination and signaled as much by not turning in their so-called blue slips to the committee.It used to be a Senate tradition that, in the name of collegiality, the Judiciary Committee would not advance a judicial nominee until both senators from that nominee\u2019s home state turned in a blue piece of paper signaling they were on board with doing so. But Republicans ignored that tradition for appeals court nominees when Donald Trump was president and when the GOP controlled the Senate \u2014 18 times, to be exact \u2014 which resulted in 17 of those nominees sailing through the committee and to confirmation over Democratic objections.What goes around comes around, Durbin basically said Wednesday.\u201cRepublicans chose to abandon this senatorial courtesy,\u201d said the Illinois Democrat. \u201cSimply put, there shouldn\u2019t be one set of rules for Republican nominees under a Republican president and a different set for nominees under a different president.\u201dThat didn\u2019t stop Blackburn from complaining. She said Biden\u2019s White House \u201chas made it clear that they intend to eliminate the role of home-state senators in the nomination process,\u201d and said there was \u201cno meaningful consultation\u201d with the White House in its selection of Mathis.The White House disputed the idea that there weren\u2019t meaningful consultations with Blackburn and Hagerty ahead of Mathis\u2019 hearing.\u201cWe were grateful to discuss potential candidates for the Sixth Circuit with both Tennessee senators\u2019 offices starting several months ago, and are enthusiastic about Andre Mathis\u2019 historic nomination,\u201d said White House spokesman Andrew Bates. \u201cThe White House regularly consults with home-state senators on both sides of the aisle regarding vacancies in their state and will continue to do so in good faith.\u201dA quick review of history shows Blackburn consistently voted to confirm Trump\u2019s appeals court nominees who didn\u2019t have blue slips turned in by Democratic senators. Since she became a senator in 2019, Blackburn voted for all 14 of Trump\u2019s appeals court picks missing blue slips. In all cases, she voted \u201cyes\u201d both on a procedural step to proceed and on final confirmation.Blackburn also voted to confirm those nominees over the objections of home-state Democratic senators who argued they had not been meaningfully consulted by the White House on their nominations.Biden has confirmed a huge number of judicial nominees since taking office, many of whom are diverse and historic firsts on the federal bench. But Mathis, currently a partner at the law firm Butler Snow LLP in Memphis, is Biden\u2019s first to advance from a state with two Republican senators and without the support of home-state senators.If confirmed, Mathis, 41, would be the first Black man on the Sixth Circuit from Tennessee.Beyond her protests over process, Blackburn said she has \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Mathis\u2019 lack of experience, noting he has never been a judge or argued a case in a federal appellate court. Mathis has practiced law for about 14 years, with a focus on commercial litigation, and has done significant pro bono work with the Tennessee Innocence Project.She also said Mathis has \u201ca rap sheet with a laundry list of citations, including multiple failures to appear in court.\u201d What Blackburn referred to as a rap sheet \u2014 a term for a criminal record \u2014 was actually just three speeding tickets that Mathis got more than 10 years ago, one of which was for going five miles over the speed limit. His drivers\u2019 license was temporarily suspended when he didn\u2019t pay them or go to court over them.Mathis said he simply forgot to pay the tickets and didn\u2019t realize his license had been suspended until he got a notice in the mail, at which point he paid them.\u201cIn Tennessee, we expect our judges to respect the law,\u201d said the Tennessee Republican. \u201cIf Mr. Mathis thought he was above the law before, imagine how he\u2019ll conduct himself if he\u2019s confirmed as a federal judge.\u201dBlackburn did not mention that it was just last year that she was pulled over by Capitol Police while riding in a car, got out of the car, informed the officer that she was a U.S. senator and flashed her congressional pin before being let go.Durbin took issue with Blackburn\u2019s attention on Mathis\u2019 driving record.\u201cSen. Blackburn refers to your \u2018rap sheet,\u2019 is what she called it,\u201d he said to Mathis. \u201cWell, if speeding tickets are a rap sheet, I\u2019ve got one too. I never got a speeding ticket for driving five miles over the limit, which apparently is one of your tickets ... We\u2019ve all I think been guilty of that sin and perhaps all have a rap sheet that\u2019s over six miles or more.\u201dAsked by Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) about his professional background, Mathis said he has significant trial experience and has handled 23 appeals to conclusion in state courts, with one case currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. He said he\u2019s been the primary drafter of briefs in the vast majority of appeals he\u2019s handled, and has argued 10 cases before the Tennessee Court of Appeals.Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who joined the hearing later, said he \u201calmost laughed\u201d when he learned that Blackburn brought up Mathis\u2019 driving record and referred to it as \u201ca rap sheet.\u201d\u201cI laughed with my staff that I have a rap sheet now, probably much longer than the witnesses,\u201d said Booker, describing his experiences as the first Black family moving into his New Jersey neighborhood as a kid.\u201cI was pulled over quite a few more times than [my white friends] were. We all knew what it was about,\u201d he said. \u201cMy brother and I used to think, \u2018If we\u2019re Black, you just prepare for being pulled over.\u2019 Sometimes I was pulled over for going three miles over the speed limit, for something cracked or that looked awry on my car.\u201dBooker asked Mathis if he, too, experienced \u201cdriving while Black\u201d while growing up.\u201cI take responsibility for my actions. I don\u2018t want to blame anything or anyone else for what I did,\u201d Mathis said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ll say about that.\u201dSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostSen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) said Wednesday that she has serious concerns with one of President Joe Biden\u2019s Black judicial nominees and referenced his \u201crap sheet\u201d of old speeding tickets, a suggestion of a criminal record when there is none.During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Blackburn said she would oppose Andre Mathis\u2019 nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit for a few reasons. She accused the White House of not providing \u201cmeaningful consultation\u201d on his nomination, which is for a court seat based in her state. She said she didn\u2019t think Mathis had enough experience, either. She said her preferred nominee was Camille McMullen, an African American judge on the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals.But then, oddly, she brought up Mathis\u2019 driving record.\u201cHe has a rap sheet with a laundry list of citations, including multiple failures to appear in court,\u201d said the Republican senator. \u201cIn Tennessee, we expect our judges to respect the law.

His driver\u2019s license was temporarily suspended when he didn\u2019t pay them on time and did not show up to court for them.Mathis told the committee he has never been arrested or charged with a crime. In the case of his speeding tickets, he said he simply forgot to pay them and didn\u2019t realize his license had been suspended until he got a notice in the mail from the Tennessee Department of Motor Vehicles, at which point he paid his tickets.He was clearly humiliated that his old speeding tickets were even an issue.\u201cI highly regret that I\u2019m in this situation,\u201d Mathis said, choking up. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve embarrassed my family. While I deserve this, they don\u2019t.\u201dDespite her concerns that Mathis was behaving as if he were above the law by not paying tickets, Blackburn did not mention that it was just last year that she was pulled over by police while riding in a car, got out of the car, indicated that she was a U.S. senator and flashed her congressional pin before being let go.Sen.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostIf there\u2019s any awards show that should inherit the shine from the increasingly irrelevant Golden Globes, it\u2019s the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Sure, the SAGs haven\u2019t entirely matched the hedonistic flair that defined the Globes in recent decades. But the star-packed ceremony hasn\u2019t exactly been hurting for buzzy moments either \u2015 be it Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston\u2019s backstage hand grab seen \u2019round the world, or \u201cParasite\u201d director Bong Joon Ho\u2019s major proud dad energy when his cast took home the 2020 top prize.So, days after the celebrity-free, untelevised Globes ceremony essentially went ignored by Hollywood \u2015 save for the social media chaos it sparked online \u2015 all eyes are on the SAGs to deliver some much-needed awards season momentum.Nominations for the 28th annual ceremony honoring the best performances in film and TV were unveiled by Rosario Dawson and Vanessa Hudgens on Wednesday, via livestream on the SAG Awards\u2019 official Instagram account.\u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d and \u201cHouse of Gucci\u201d were the top film nominees, with both netting three nods, while HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d and Apple TV+\u2019s \u201cTed Lasso\u201d dominated the television field with five nominations each. As for who\u2019s in the running for the top film prize this year, both \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201d and \u201cWest Side Story\u201d were surprisingly shut out of the Outstanding Cast field, despite making headway at the Globes.Instead, \u201cBelfast,\u201d \u201cCODA,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Look Up\u201d, \u201cHouse of Gucci\u201d and \u201cKing Richard\u201d will compete for the award. Other surprise film nominees included Bradley Cooper getting honored with a supporting nod for \u201cLicorice Pizza\u201d (while the film\u2019s breakout star Alana Haim didn\u2019t make the cut) and Cate Blanchett making her way into the Supporting Female Actor category for her performance in \u201cNightmare Alley.\u201dElsewhere, Kristen Stewart, who seemed an all-but-certain lock for her portrayal of Princess Diana in \u201cSpencer,\u201d and \u201cWest Side Story\u201d star Rachel Zegler, who just picked up one of the Best Actress Golden Globes, were snubbed.Instead, Jennifer Hudson (\u201cRespect\u201d) and Jessica Chastain (\u201cThe Eyes of Tammy Faye\u201d) both received nods and will face off against Olivia Colman (\u201cThe Lost Daughter\u201d), Lady Gaga (\u201cHouse of Gucci\u201d) and Nicole Kidman (\u201cBeing the Ricardos\u201d).On the television side, \u201cSuccession\u201d led the drama categories with Netflix\u2019s \u201cSquid Game\u201d and Apple TV+\u2019s \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d trailiing not far behind with four nods each. As for comedy, \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d which cleaned up at the most recent Emmy Awards, was the most well-represented, while Hulu\u2019s newcomer \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d also made a strong showing. A far more accurate predictor of the awards season to come, given that a significant portion of SAG-AFTRA\u2019s membership overlaps with the Academy Awards voting body, the ceremony can often make or break Oscars chances. The night\u2019s top award for Outstanding Cast is often seen as a key bellwether for whatever film will go on to Oscars glory \u2015 only a handful of movies have ever won the Academy Award for Best Picture without a SAG nomination \u2015 making the event an all-important stop along the awards campaign trail. But it remains to be seen whether this year\u2019s ceremony will be held at all, with the surge in COVID-19 cases and concerns about the omicron variant. In recent weeks, some awards shows have chosen to push back any in-person gatherings until later in the year, and both the Critics Choice Awards and the Grammys have been indefinitely postponed.The SAGs, however, seem intent on holding a non-virtual celebration, after last year\u2019s show was delayed until early spring and reduced to a pretaped telecast spanning only a single hour. But, the only real question remaining is what aggressively casual, but statement-making sweater Jason Sudeikis will wear at this year\u2019s ceremony. The 28th annual SAG Awards is set to air on TNT and TBS on Sunday, Feb. 27, at 8 p.m.Check out the list of nominees below: Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture\u201cBelfast\u201d\u201cCODA\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t Look Up\u201d\u201cHouse of Gucci\u201d\u201cKing Richard\u201d Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role in a Motion PictureJessica Chastain, \u201cThe Eyes of Tammy Faye\u201dOlivia Colman, \u201cThe Lost Daughter\u201dLady Gaga, \u201cHouse of Gucci\u201dJennifer Hudson, \u201cRespect\u201dNicole Kidman, \u201cBeing the Ricardos\u201dOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role in a Motion PictureJavier Bardem, \u201cBeing the Ricardos\u201dBenedict Cumberbatch, \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201dAndrew Garfield, \u201cTick, Tick \u2026 Boom!\u201dWill Smith, \u201cKing Richard\u201dDenzel Washington, \u201cThe Tragedy of Macbeth\u201dOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion PictureCaitr\u00edona Balfe, \u201cBelfast\u201dCate Blanchett, \u201cNightmare Alley\u201dAriana DeBose, \u201cWest Side Story\u201dKirsten Dunst, \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201dRuth Negga, \u201cPassing\u201dOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion PictureBen Affleck, \u201cThe Tender Bar\u201dBradley Cooper, \u201cLicorice Pizza\u201dTroy Kotsur, \u201cCODA\u201dJared Leto, \u201cHouse of Gucci\u201dKodi Smit-McPhee, \u201cThe Power of the Dog\u201dOutstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series\u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d\u201cThe Morning Show\u201d\u201cSquid Game\u201d\u201cSuccession\u201d\u201cYellowstone\u201dOutstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series\u201cThe Great\u201d\u201cHacks\u201d\u201cThe Kominsky Method\u201d\u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d\u201cTed Lasso\u201dOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama SeriesJennifer Aniston, \u201cThe Morning Show\u201dJung Ho-yeon, \u201cSquid Game\u201dElisabeth Moss, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201dSarah Snook, \u201cSuccession\u201dReese Witherspoon, \u201cThe Morning Show\u201dOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama SeriesBrian Cox, \u201cSuccession\u201dBilly Crudup, \u201cThe Morning Show\u201dKieran Culkin, \u201cSuccession\u201dLee Jung-jae, \u201cSquid Game\u201dJeremy Strong, \u201cSuccession\u201dOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Comedy SeriesElle Fanning, \u201cThe Great\u201dSandra Oh, \u201cThe Chair\u201dJean Smart, \u201cHacks\u201dJuno Temple, \u201cTed Lasso\u201dHannah Waddingham, \u201cTed Lasso\u201dOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Comedy SeriesMichael Douglas, \u201cThe Kominsky Method\u201dBrett Goldstein, \u201cTed Lasso\u201dSteve Martin, \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201dMartin Short, \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201dJason Sudeikis, \u201cTed Lasso\u201dOutstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Limited SeriesJennifer Coolidge, \u201cThe White Lotus\u201dCynthia Erivo, \u201cGenius: Aretha\u201dMargaret Qualley, \u201cMaid\u201dJean Smart, \u201cMare of Easttown\u201dKate Winslet, \u201cMare of Easttown\u201dOutstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Television Movie or Limited SeriesMurray Bartlett, \u201cThe White Lotus\u201dOscar Isaac, \u201cScenes From a Marriage\u201dMichael Keaton, \u201cDopesick\u201dEwan McGregor, \u201cHalston\u201dEvan Peters, \u201cMare of Easttown\u201dOutstanding Action Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Motion Picture\u201cBlack Widow\u201d\u201cDune\u201d\u201cThe Matrix Resurrections\u201d \u201cNo Time To Die\u201d\u201cShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\u201dOutstanding Action Performance by a Stunt Ensemble in a Television Series\u201cCobra Kai\u201d\u201cThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier\u201d\u201cLoki\u201d\u201cMare of Easttown\u201d\u201cSquid Game\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Trends Reporter, HuffPostMike Pence\u2019s onetime press secretary said Saturday that the former vice president will likely need a subpoena before he\u2019ll cooperate with the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection.While Pence wants to do his part, the issue is a political landmine for him, Alyssa Farah Griffin explained on CNN. Committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), said Friday he\u2019ll ask Pence to voluntarily testify sometime this month.\u201cI anticipate that he\u2019ll cooperate with the committee in some capacity,\u201d Griffin said, though noted that she hasn\u2019t discussed the matter with him. She characterized Pence as a \u201cby-the book ... institutionalist,\u201d adding: \u201cI think that if he were to receive a subpoena, he would absolutely comply. He believes in the oversight role that Congress has on the executive branch. I\u2019m a little more skeptical that he would [cooperate] in a volunteer capacity.\u201d\u201cWere he to go in in a voluntary capacity, I think it could be perceived as he was trying to help the committee,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he wants to do what he\u2019s obligated to under the Constitution ... but I think they\u2019re more likely to get information from him with a subpoena.\u201dGriffin said she believes the most explosive information from Pence\u2019s day at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and before has likely already been provided to investigators by his then-chief of staff Marc Short, who was by Pence\u2019s side at the White House and the entire day Jan. 6 and has already talked to House investigators.Griffin said she has already voluntarily talked to Republican members of the committee and offered to testify before the full panel.After she was hit with hate mail following reports of her cooperation, she slammed the moral \u201cdisrepair\u201d of the Republican Party for its failure to face the alarming threat of the riot at the Capitol.Getting a lot of hate from the Right for thinking 1/6 was a big deal. 1) there\u2019s nothing less conservative or trying to overturn democratic process 2) I watched a violent mob call for my boss & mentor, Mike Pence, to be hanged on the steps of the US Capitol.If we can\u2019t acknowledge we are morally in disrepair as a Party, it will be the GOP\u2019s undoing, not how bad Biden is doing or how ineffective democrats\u2019 policies are.Check out Griffin\u2019s full CNN interview in the video clip up top.Trends Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostSen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) announced Sunday that he will run for reelection, after months of speculation around his possible retirement.\u201cIt is not a decision I have made lightly,\u201d Johnson said in his statement. \u201cWhen re-election is not your primary motivation, those are easy promises to keep \u2014 and I have faithfully done so. That attitude is relatively unique in Washington, and it may be one reason why many appreciate having me involved in the national debate,\u201d he said. Johnson, who was an executive at a family plastics company before getting into politics in 2010, rode into the Senate on the tea party wave and defeated sitting Democrat Russ Feingold. He beat Feingold once again in 2016, when Donald Trump narrowly won Wisconsin in the presidential election. He said his 2016 run would be his last.In an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal Sunday morning, Johnson said he decided to renege on that statement because he feels \u201cAmerica is in peril.\u201d\u201cCountless people have encouraged me to run, saying they rely on me to be their voice, to speak plain and obvious truths other elected leaders shirk from expressing \u2015 truths the elite in government, mainstream media and Big Tech don\u2019t want you to hear,\u201d Johnson wrote.He has long been among the more conservative members of the Senate: He has said he doesn\u2019t believe in climate change or global warming, has strict anti-immigration views and has long fought to dismantle Obamacare.Over the last five years, he has also fully adopted Trump\u2019s Republican Party. When Trump downplayed COVID-19, Johnson questioned the seriousness of the disease as well. He spread conspiracy theories about coronavirus vaccines and refused to get one himself, and also called for more research into debunked treatments like hydroxychloroquine.The senator also refused to accept the 2020 election results, and continues to call on Wisconsin Republicans to take over the elections system. He has defended Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, saying they were people who \u201clove this country\u201d and that he would have been much more scared had they been Black Lives Matter protesters. He said he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel threatened\u201d by the deadly riot.In one New York Times article, some Wisconsin Republicans called him a modern-day Joe McCarthy, the late Republican senator from Wisconsin who staged the national witch hunt for communists in the 1950s \u2014 dubbed \u201cMcCarthyism\u201d \u2014 that ultimately destroyed the livelihood of many. McCarthy, who had an acrimonious relationship with many of his Senate colleagues, was ultimately censured. Johnson dismissed the comparisons in an interview with The New York Times.\u201cHaving already experienced a growing level of vitriol and false attacks, I certainly don\u2019t expect better treatment in the future,\u201d Johnson said in his statement announcing his Senate run.Republicans were holding out hope that Johnson would seek reelection, saving them the trouble of finding another candidate at the start of the election year. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in August that he expected Johnson to run again. Johnson had also hinted that this would be the case, saying his \u201cpreference\u201d would be to retire from the Senate but that he was \u201cpanicked for the direction of this country.\u201dJohnson has become an easy punching bag for Democrats in Wisconsin, who are trying not only to flip his seat but also keep control of the state\u2019s governorship. Democrats have a large field of candidates running to be their nominee, and the pack is currently led by Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes and state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski.\u201cWhether he was manipulating the GOP tax scam bill to enrich himself and his biggest political donors, trying to drive up health care costs and rip away protections for pre-existing conditions, or failing to crack down on China\u2019s illicit economic practices and companies that outsource our jobs, Johnson has proven over and over again he\u2019s only ever focused on serving himself,\u201d Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler said in a statement.Democrats across the nation face a tough election year in 2022. But they hope Johnson has the same effect on Wisconsin\u2019s more suburban Republicans as Trump did in 2020, when Joe Biden narrowly won the state.Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) \u201ccheered\u201d the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol last year as his fellow lawmakers feared for their lives, said a former aide to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).Brooks had urged on then-President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters at a National Mall rally just before they stormed the Capitol, telling them to be ready to make a \u201cblood\u201d sacrifice, just as Americans did during the Revolution. He also told them to march on the Capitol and said it was time \u201cpatriots start taking down names and kicking ass.\u201d He was wearing body armor at the time.Later, when a pro-Trump mob breached the Capitol, lawmakers on the House floor were \u201cfearful for their lives. Republican members ... men crying in the cloakroom for their safety,\u201d former McCarthy aide Ryan O\u2019Toole told Jake Tapper on Thursday on CNN.\u201cAs we escaped the chamber \u2014 to what sounded like gunshots \u2014 to the secure location, I think people were still scared ... and not sure what was happening,\u201d added O\u2019Toole, who\u2019s now deputy policy director for Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), vice chair of the House select committee investigating the riot.Not everyone had the same attitude, O\u2019Toole noted. \u201cMo Brooks, for example, was glad,\u201d he added. \u201cHe was cheering on the fact that the 117th Congress started this way. That was much to the dismay of others in the room.\u201dBrooks denied in a statement to Alabama Political Reporter that he was cheering the attack. He told AL.com that O\u2019Toole\u2019s account was \u201ctotal bovine excrement\u201d and suggested it was intended to harm his campaign for Senate this year. He added that O\u2019Toole\u2019s switch to Cheney\u2019s staff \u201csays a lot about why he lied.\u201d Cheney has been criticized by fellow Republicans for not buying in to Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election being stolen from him and for chastising the former president for inciting the mob attack last year based on those lies.O\u2019Toole told Tapper he changed employers because he wanted to work for someone who is \u201cloyal to the Constitution.\u201d He said McCarthy\u2019s leadership \u201cstrategy is dictated by the most extreme wings of the party.\u201dBrooks also emphasized in a message to AL.com that he has previously called for prosecuting anyone involved in the insurrection who \u201cviolated the law.\u201dAli Alexander, the key figure behind the Jan. 6 Stop the Steal rally, has said Brooks was one of three Republican congressmen who helped him plan the rally \u2014 which Brooks has denied.

It was awful,\u201d Affleck told the LA Times. \u201cIt was everything that I didn\u2019t like about this. That became the moment where I said, \u2018I\u2019m not doing this anymore.\u2019 It\u2019s not even about, like, \u2018Justice League\u2019 was so bad. Because it could have been anything.\u201dWhedon, who created \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer,\u201d has been accused of being emotionally abusive and \u201ctoxic\u201d on the set of the late-1990s to early-2000s series and its spinoff \u201cAngel.\u201d In 2020, Ray Fisher, who played Cyborg in the 2017 \u201cJustice League,\u201d similarly accused Whedon of being \u201cabusive,\u201d \u201cgross\u201d and \u201cunprofessional\u201d on the set of the superhero film.Elsewhere in the interview, Affleck noted that as he advanced in his career, he realized he needed to \u201cstick to what my standards were\u201d when it came to choosing projects.\u201cI\u2019m not preoccupied with notions of success or failure about money or commercial success, because those things really corrupt your choices,\u201d he later said. \u201cThen what happens is the movies are less interesting and you\u2019re less good.\u201d (Read his entire interview the LA Times here.)\u201cThe Tender Bar\u201d actor faced backlash last month after he discussed his marriage to Garner during an interview on \u201cThe Howard Stern Show,\u201d and seemingly suggested that part of the reason he started drinking was because he felt \u201ctrapped.\u201d\u201cI was like, \u2018I can\u2019t leave \u2019cause of my kids, but I\u2019m not happy, what do I do?\u2019\u201d he said at one point during the lengthy interview, according to People. \u201cWhat I did was drink a bottle of scotch and fall asleep on the couch, which turned out not to be the solution.\u201dAffleck later criticized news outlets for taking clips of his two-hour interview out of context, and making him out to be the \u201cworst, most insensitive, stupid, awful guy.\u201d\u201cI would never want my kids to ever believe I would say a bad word about their mom,\u201d he said during an appearance on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live.\u201d\u201cThe Tender Bar\u201d hit select theaters last month and premiered on Amazon Prime this week.Trends Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

One introductory phone chat, however, was all it took to convince him that love was not in the cards for the two men. \u201cAndy violated my cardinal rule, which is he asked about my mom within the first minute of talking to me,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t even a question.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostKanye West might be moving in, but Kim Kardashian West and Pete Davidson have ditched Calabasas and his native New York for sandier shores. The rebound couple of the year are proving that they might just have some staying power, as they private-jetted off on their first international trip together earlier this week. Kardashian West and Davidson, about whom rumors of romance first surfaced in October, were spotted boarding a plane bound for the Bahamas on Monday after spending the holidays apart. Photos obtained by E! News gave us a bit of an idea of what the pair have been up to. On Wednesday, they were spotted getting off a boat together in decidedly beach-unfriendly attire, with Kardashian West wearing a black bodysuit under baggy ripped jeans and Davidson opting for a beige sweatsuit and a letterman jacket. The pair kept it relatively low key in the PDA department, only grinning as they walked along the dock beside each other. The two are reportedly \u201cstaying at a private home right on the water with close friends, including [Kardashian-Jenner family friend] Simon Huck,\u201d according to TMZ. A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian)Kardashian West seems to be enjoying herself, posting a bikini pic \u2014 presumably snapped from the Bahamas \u2014 on Instagram on Thursday. \u201cSweet sweet fantasy baby,\u201d Kardashian, quoting Mariah Carey\u2019s 1995 song \u201cFantasy,\u201d wrote alongside the photo of herself lounging while listening to music with a copy of Vanity Fair. After spending the holidays on separate coasts, the getaway is somewhat of a reunion for the couple, who haven\u2019t been spotted together since a Staten Island rendezvous in December. Kardashian then gathered with friends and family for her annual Christmas party in California, and Davidson rang in 2022 alongside Miley Cyrus in Miami for her live New Year\u2019s Eve special.An unnamed Entertainment Tonight source said the duo \u201cknow they have a busy couple of months coming up with her company rebrand and Pete filming various projects, so they wanted to take some time to spend together before things ramp up.\u201dAs for the Kanye West of it all, he seems to be moving on as well. After spending the last few months of the year begging Kardashian to get back together following her divorce filing in February 2021, he seems to have taken the hint that their marriage is done for good. Since the beginning of 2022, the rapper has been spotted on multiple dates with \u201cUncut Gems\u201d star Julia Fox. After linking up in Miami over the weekend, the pair attended a performance of \u201cSlave Play\u201d on Broadway Tuesday night before grabbing dinner with friends in New York City.Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The Iowa native is competing in the U.S. Figure Skating Championships this week, and could be on their way to joining Team USA at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.If LeDuc succeeds, they\u2019ll become the first nonbinary athlete to compete in the Winter Games \u2015 and it\u2019s a prospect they don\u2019t take lightly. In an interview with NBCLX\u2019s \u201cMy New Favorite Olympian\u201d podcast, LeDuc \u2015 who uses they/them pronouns \u2015 spoke at length about the challenges they faced navigating the very gendered world of figure skating. \u201cFor me, as a person that exists and really thrives outside of the binary, it can be very complicated sometimes,\u201d they said. \u201cThere are going to be the people that don\u2019t understand it or would be very quick to push me back into the box of, you know, they look at me, they see that I have a beard or they look at maybe my physical characteristics and say, \u2018You\u2019re a boy. Act like a boy. What are you doing?\u2019\u201d LeDuc, now 31, said they initially came out to their evangelical Christian parents as gay shortly after turning 18. A decade later, they told their family that they were nonbinary. Though LeDuc said their parents now embrace them as their true self, they recalled a time when a family member \u201cbasically tried to perform an exorcism on me\u201d and, in doing so, attempted to remedy their \u201csame-sex attraction.\u201dAnd while they found solace on the ice, securing a committed skating partner was another challenge. In 2016, they finally teamed up with Ashley Cain-Gribble of Texas. \u201cWe never wanted to be what was looked at as the traditional team,\u201d Cain-Gribble said on the podcast. \u201cWe want people to look at our skating and know that they don\u2019t have to change who they are in order to be a part of this sport, in order to do something that they\u2019re passionate about.\u201d The number of Olympic athletes who identify as LGBTQ while actively competing has grown substantially in recent years. Last August, Canadian soccer player Quinn became the first openly transgender and nonbinary athlete to win an Olympic medal following their team\u2019s defeat of Sweden in the women\u2019s final. Alongside Quinn were Laurel Hubbard, a weightlifter from New Zealand; Chelsea Wolfe, on the U.S. women\u2019s BMX Freestyle team; and American skateboarder Alana Smith.And in 2018, freeskier Gus Kenworthy and figure skater Adam Rippon became Team USA\u2019s first two openly gay male athletes to compete in the Winter Games.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostIt\u2019s been a year since 147 Republican lawmakers voted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election after fueling a lie about widespread voter fraud.They cast their votes just hours after a mob of white supremacist supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol with plans to kill House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), Vice President Mike Pence and others to stop them from certifying President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s win. They believed the lie, and Trump himself egged them on. Hundreds of lawmakers, staff, reporters and other workers hid for their lives. Five people died and hundreds were injured. Four police officers who defended the Capitol that day later died by suicide.Biden overwhelmingly won the election. There was never evidence of widespread voter fraud.Do those 147 Republicans now concede that Biden was elected president, fair and square, a full year later? Do they regret their votes against certifying the Electoral College count? HuffPost posed both questions to all 147 Republicans over the span of a couple of weeks in December, either in person or via their offices. (One of those members, former Rep. Ron Wright of Texas, passed away in February.)They overwhelmingly declined to answer.\u201cCall our press office,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) when asked if he believes Biden fairly won the election a year ago.Cruz stood in a Senate elevator as he spoke, and the doors weren\u2019t closing for some reason. HuffPost pressed him on why he wouldn\u2019t answer the question himself since it was about his own belief. For the next seven seconds, Cruz stared blankly in silence until the doors finally closed.\u201cCold,\u201d muttered a Capitol Hill photographer standing nearby.HuffPost went ahead and followed up with Cruz\u2019s press office. \u201cThanks, Jen, we\u2019ll check on this,\u201d his spokesperson Maria Jeffrey emailed back. They never responded after that.\u201cWho are you with?\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) when asked if he regretted his Jan. 6 vote. When HuffPost identified itself, Kennedy walked away.\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t have anything for you on that,\u201d he said. \u201cI have people waiting on me.\u201dHuffPost asked Kennedy again a couple of weeks later, in the event he actually had people waiting on him that first time.\u201cI don\u2019t have anything for you,\u201d he said again, walking away.Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.) laughed as HuffPost began asking about her vote against certifying Biden\u2019s election.\u201cI don\u2019t do hallway interviews,\u201d she said, stepping into a Senate elevator.Asked if she does elevator interviews, Hyde-Smith chuckled again as the doors closed. \u201cI don\u2019t do them in the elevator, either.\u201dSome GOP senators seemed annoyed at having to answer the question at all.\u201cHe\u2019s the constitutionally elected president,\u201d said Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who voted against certifying Biden\u2019s election. \u201cI\u2019ve said it like a zillion times.\u201dAsked if he regretted his vote, Scott simply said, \u201cNo.\u201dSens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) and Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) both firmly said \u201cyes\u201d when asked if they believe Biden won the election fairly. And both just as firmly said \u201cno\u201d about regretting their Jan. 6 votes against certifying the Electoral College results.Aides to Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) \u2015 the remaining two GOP senators who voted against certifying Biden\u2019s election \u2015 did not respond to emailed requests for comment on both questions.Of the 139 House Republicans who voted to overturn the election, an aide to just one of them \u2015 one! \u2015 responded to HuffPost\u2019s questions.\u201cCongressman Sessions stands firm in his decision to vote against certifying the election results of Arizona and Pennsylvania for the purpose of further review,\u201d said Nicole Myers, a spokesperson for Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas).\u201cThere were abnormalities and inconsistencies that Americans were and are still very concerned about,\u201d said Myers, even though there has never been any evidence of widespread voting fraud in Arizona or in Pennsylvania. \u201cCongressman Sessions\u2019 vote was never intended to overturn the election rather to send back the results to the states for a deeper investigation so that Americans could have peace of mind and confidence in the election system.\u201dAn aide to Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) also replied to HuffPost\u2019s email but apparently only to complain about not being asked about something else.\u201cReaching back out with one question: Is this the first time you\u2019ve written to me this year?\u201d wrote Issa spokesperson Jonathan Wilcox.When HuffPost said yes, it appeared to be, Wilcox responded, \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought, too.\u201d He never followed up with an answer to either question.For the moment, Rep. Tom Rice (S.C.) appears to be the only House Republican who publicly regrets his vote against certifying Biden\u2019s win.He told Politico last month that he should have voted to certify \u201cbecause President Trump was responsible for the attack on the Capitol.\u201d\u201cIn the wee hours of that disgraceful night, while waiting for the Capitol of our great country to be secured, I knew I should vote to certify,\u201d Rice said. \u201cBut because I had made a public announcement of my intent to object, I did not want to go back on my word. So, yeah, I regret my vote to object.\u201dAlex Enlow, a spokesperson for Rep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.), made a point to highlight that her boss did vote to certify the votes for Biden as president. Enlow used to work for Rep. Greg Steube (R-Fla.), who voted not to certify Biden\u2019s win, and HuffPost initially reached out to her for comment about Steube. Enlow responded with an update on her job change \u2015 and a statement from Scott.\u201cCongress does not have the Constitutional authority to overturn a state\u2019s electoral votes,\u201d Scott said, \u201cso I upheld my oath to the Constitution and voted to certify the election.\u201dSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPostThey are some of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s most critical assets, and federal authorities don\u2019t know many of their names. Or exactly how many of them there are.One year into an unprecedented investigation of the thousands of rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, the FBI is leaning on a band of digital investigators to both identify suspects and piece together an overwhelming mountain of evidence from that day, much of which was recorded by the perpetrators themselves. The crowdsourced effort, organized on social media last year in the wake of the Capitol attack, has affected hundreds of the more than 700 cases that federal prosecutors have brought in the past 12 months.There\u2019s much, much more to come. The digital investigators have successfully identified hundreds of individuals who were captured on video committing crimes on Jan. 6 but have not yet been charged, including dozens and dozens of violent rioters whose images are featured on the FBI\u2019s U.S. Capitol Violence website.\u201cSometimes it feels like we\u2019re way ahead of them,\u201d one sleuth told HuffPost. \u201cAnd then sometimes they arrest someone or release new security footage and it smacks us in the face with how much more there is to uncover.\u201dFrom their home offices, couches, kitchen tables, bedrooms and garages, these independent investigators have played a remarkable role in archiving and preserving digital evidence. Often operating under the \u201cSedition Hunters\u201d moniker, they\u2019ve archived more than 2,000 Facebook accounts, over 1,125 YouTube channels, 500-plus Instagram accounts, nearly 1,000 Twitter feeds, more than 100 Rumble profiles and over 250 TikTok accounts. They\u2019ve gathered more than 4.1 terabytes \u2015 4,100 gigabytes \u2015 of data, enough to fill dozens of new iPhones with standard-issue storage.The sleuths have a wealth of information that the broader public won\u2019t learn for months. They know that two suspects currently on the FBI\u2019s website are related to defendants who have already been charged with lesser offenses in the Capitol riot. They know that someone else on the FBI list died suddenly a few months ago. They know that another suspected participant in the Jan. 6 attack has been arrested in connection with a long-unsolved murder. And they\u2019ve compiled information that likely will never land in an FBI case: like the fact that there were more than 50 dogs among the mob on Jan. 6. The FBI\u2019s Capitol riot investigation was pretty chaotic in the early days as the bureau attempted to separate the wheat from the chaff amid hundreds of thousands of tips from the public. It could be difficult for investigators with rock-solid tips to get the bureau\u2019s attention.But there\u2019s been a shift as the investigation has progressed. Citizen investigators who previously had to submit their tips through forms on the FBI\u2019s website now either have individual relationships with FBI special agents or at least know someone who can ensure the information gets into the right hands. If they turn up relevant information about a defendant who has already been charged \u2015 say, evidence of a misdemeanor defendant assaulting an officer, or a defendant on pretrial release violating the conditions of their release \u2015 sleuths have reached out to federal prosecutors directly. Their meticulously compiled dossiers are so in-depth that in some cases they effectively ghostwrote FBI affidavits, laying out bulletproof cases against Capitol rioters based on open-source intelligence alone. Their crowdsourced Capitol maps and catchy nicknames for Jan. 6 rioters have shown up in Justice Department filings time and time again. Many of the sleuths are still astonished at the effect they\u2019re having in the largest FBI investigation in the bureau\u2019s history.\u201cI\u2019m just some idiot sitting here in his garage,\u201d another investigator at the center of the effort told HuffPost. \u201cHow the hell is this happening?\u201dThe record that online sleuths have built since last January is impressive. They\u2019ve played a key role in identifying many of the most serious cases against Capitol riot suspects. They\u2019re at the center of the longest sentence imposed in the Jan. 6 investigation so far: Robert Scott Palmer, who turned himself in to the FBI just 12 days after he was identified in a HuffPost story based on a tip from an online sleuth, was sentenced to more than five years in federal prison. Online investigators also helped identify the perpetrator of one of the most serious attacks of Jan. 6: Daniel Rodriguez, who drove a stun gun into the neck of former D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone.Among their other highlights in the past year:In the aftermath of an FBI raid on the home of an Alaska woman who the bureau mistakenly believed had entered House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office on Jan. 6, online sleuths managed to correctly identify the true suspect and her son in roughly 30 minutes. Building off of the tip, the FBI arrested the actual suspects months later.After scouring hours of video footage from then-President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally, held near the White House just before the attack, online sleuths managed to find a full image of the face of a suspect they\u2019d nicknamed #CatSweat because he was wearing a Caterpillar sweatshirt when he battled officers and helped drag one officer down the stairs of the U.S. Capitol. A facial recognition hit turned up images of Logan Barnhart at bodybuilding competitions and posing on the covers of romance novels, and sleuths confirmed his identity by matching items of clothing he was wearing on his Instagram page.Hours before a sentencing, investigators turned up evidence of a misdemeanor defendant appearing to assault an officer by shoving him down the stairs when he was surrounded by a mob. Prosecutors, who had initially sought a sentence of two months behind bars, requested a delay of the sentencing and advocated for six months\u2019 incarceration (the defendant ultimately received three months).Following in sleuths\u2019 footsteps, the FBI used Facebook photos posted by a suspect\u2019s mom to confirm the identity of a young man accused of pepper-spraying officers and smashing out a window at the U.S. Capitol and who then went to Air Force basic training (which his mom also bragged about on Facebook).The community of online sleuths has also helped shut down some of the conspiracy theories that have cropped up in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack. When an attorney for several Capitol riot suspects told Tucker Carlson\u2019s Fox News viewers that a man wielding a police shield while wearing a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d hat and red face paint was \u201cclearly a law enforcement officer\u201d and an \u201cagent provocateur,\u201d online sleuths moved to swiftly gut the conspiracy theory. They revealed the man\u2019s actual identity as a St. Louis Cardinals superfan who calls himself \u201cRally Runner.\u201d He has been running around Busch Stadium (and praising Trump and Carlson on his Facebook page) for years. Online sleuths have often been frustrated with the pace of the FBI investigation and have sometimes been left speculating about why cases against suspects they\u2019ve identified as violent aren\u2019t moving forward even months after they had been identified for the bureau. But inside the FBI and Justice Department, it\u2019s undeniable that online investigators have had a major influence. In recent months, authorities have made several gestures, both privately and publicly, to illustrate to the online investigators how much their efforts are appreciated. Attorney General Merrick Garland even referenced the work of \u201ccitizen sleuths around the country\u201d during a congressional hearing in October.In which Attorney General Merrick Garland gives a shoutout to \u201ccitizen sleuths across the country\u201d who are identifying Capitol rioters. #SeditionHunters pic.twitter.com/v1q1ttu8jQ\u201cAs we have seen with dozens of cases so far, the tips matter,\u201d a bureau official said in a statement. \u201cWhile it may appear that no overt law enforcement action is being taken on some tips that have been submitted, tipsters should rest assured that the FBI is working diligently behind the scenes to follow all investigative leads to verify tips from the public and bring these criminals to justice.\u201dAfter he was abducted and viciously assaulted by members of the pro-Trump mob on Jan. 6, Officer Fanone thought that might be the end. Law enforcement was overwhelmed that day and didn\u2019t have the manpower to control and arrest the violent rioters amid a crowd of thousands flooding into the Capitol building. Fanone has been blown away by what anonymous investigators have turned up after poring over the extensive footage filmed at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and matching that up with information available on the open web. A few months back, Fanone was able to meet Forrest Rogers, now an open-source investigator with Switzerland-based newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung, who, as a member of the sleuthing group Deep State Dogs, first turned up the footage of Danny Rodriguez driving the stun gun into Fanone\u2019s neck. Rogers had gone through the video frame by frame.Rogers ran into roadblocks trying to get in touch with someone at the Metropolitan Police Department to tell them about the video in the wake of the attack, which frustrated Fanone because he thought it should have been very clear that Rogers \u201cknew what the fuck he was doing.\u201dThe progress that online sleuths have made from behind their computer screens has left the former undercover officer wondering whether law enforcement needs to reconsider what sort of skill sets they look for in recruits.\u201cHow was it that this mass of civilian sleuths were able to compile all this information and so rapidly?\u201d Fanone asked.\u201cI grew up going to Baltimore Orioles games with my dad, and every time someone hit a home run and a fan caught it\u2026 they would say, \u2018Give that fan a contract,\u2019\u201d Fanone said. \u201cMaybe we need to be changing what it is that we\u2019re looking for in our hiring, because I sure as shit don\u2019t know how to do any of that crap. I still fucking turn off my computer by pulling the plug.\u201d Sleuths have logged more than 2,300 individuals who entered the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Combined with the hundreds of suspects on the FBI\u2019s Capitol Violence webpage, that brings the total universe of potential Capitol riot defendants to nearly 3,000. Of the hundreds already identified, many seem to have no clue what is coming for them. Living in their right-wing social media cocoons, they seem blissfully unaware that they\u2019re in the sights of online sleuths and the FBI. \u201cDonald Trump will be back in office SOON and a revival like we have never imagined is swelling as we speak,\u201d one Jan. 6 suspect identified by sleuths, but not yet arrested, wrote online in recent months. The Sedition Hunters community isn\u2019t going to let up. As the investigation matures, they could begin to transform into what one sleuth called a \u201cpowerful lobby\u201d that can hold the FBI\u2019s feet to the fire, making sure that participants in the Jan. 6 riot face justice for attacking democracy.\u201cWe know who these people are,\u201d one said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let it slide.\u201dRyan Reilly is HuffPost\u2019s senior justice reporter covering the Justice Department, federal law enforcement, criminal justice and legal affairs.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Trends Reporter, HuffPostDonald Trump came so dangerously close to successfully orchestrating the overthrow of the U.S. government last year that he only needed a few extra radical loyalists to pull it off, warned a chilling essay Monday in the conservative website The Bulwark.Trump was just \u201cfive Rudys short\u201d of a successful coup, cautioned longtime attorney and frequent Bulwark contributor Philip Rotner, referring to Trump\u2019s rabidly loyal ally Rudy Giuliani.Americans can shrug off the insurrection as violence by a bunch of disorganized \u201ccrazies,\u201d Rotner noted.But the \u201csecond way of looking at 2020 is that the attempted coup came much closer to succeeding than many would admit and was just a dress rehearsal for 2024,\u201d he added. \u201cThe danger to our democracy is real. We should be very worried.\u201dWhat saved the country was that Trump hadn\u2019t yet completely \u201ccorrupted\u201d the federal government, and had largely ignored state governments, Rotner argued. Even states with Republican legislatures weren\u2019t \u201cTrumpy enough ... at the end of the day they allowed the election results in their states to be certified,\u201d Rotner wrote.Still, Trump still came frighteningly close to triggering the \u201cmother of all constitutional crises.\u201d How close? \u201cTrump fell five Rudys short,\u201d Rotner estimated.Imagine where the nation would be now, had \u201ca Rudy\u201d replaced Georgia\u2019s Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who refused Trump\u2019s order to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to turn his defeat in the state into a victory, wrote Rotner.The election could have been overturned with extra Rudys in key positions in Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2014 or with a Vice President Rudy, who would simply refuse to certify the electoral votes for the people\u2019s choice, Joe Biden, Rotner emphasized.\u201cTrump didn\u2019t fail to overturn the 2020 election because our brilliantly engineered system of constitutional government held fast ... He simply didn\u2019t have the right people in the right positions to pull it off,\u201d Rotner noted.He won\u2019t make the same mistake if he lands in the Oval Office again, Rotner warned.Read the entire essay \u201cFive Rudys From the Abyss,\u201d in The Bulwark here.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostJoin HuffPost and BuzzFeed News for a Twitter Spaces conversation about how the Capitol riot is still altering U.S. politics on Jan. 4 at 1 p.m. ET. Sign up to be notified when the Space begins here.WASHINGTON \u2014 The hallway where an angry mob of rioters first broke into the U.S. Capitol looks exactly as it did before the attack.The shards of broken glass that once littered the marble floor are long gone. The reinforced doors that were smashed through have been replaced. A blood-stained bust that witnessed Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman bravely confront the mob has been restored, its face smeared with red no more. The mayhem is but a memory. There\u2019s nothing to greet visitors, either: No plaque marks Jan. 6, 2021, one of the darkest days in U.S. history.But the scars of that day are evident in other ways, especially in the House of Representatives, where members are facing an avalanche of threats at home and even from fellow colleagues at the Capitol. They\u2019re spending more on personal security than ever. The metal detectors that were installed at entrances to the House floor following the attack are still standing, a glaring reminder of the poisonous atmosphere that has pervaded over the past year.\u201cThe tone gets, you know, tougher and tougher. It is a pretty toxic place. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before,\u201d Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), who has served in Congress for 35 years, noted in a CNN interview last week.In recent months, a GOP lawmaker posted an animated video showing him killing a Democratic congresswoman, and he was later censured over it. Another GOP lawmaker got into a screaming match with the same Democrat on the steps of the Capitol, as well as a separate feud with a GOP colleague. Democrats are also pushing to strip a separate GOP member of her committee assignments after she called a Muslim congresswoman a terrorist. Threats made to members of Congress are up threefold this year, according to the Capitol Police. Although some of the rancor predated Jan. 6, there\u2019s no doubt the events have made it worse.Things in the Senate haven\u2019t been nearly as acrimonious. Interviews with over two dozen lawmakers and aides shed light on a working environment that seems more secure, but one where day-to-day life feels pretty much the same as before, not counting the trauma experienced by those who were in the building as the screaming mob advanced into the building.\u201cIt seems like it\u2019s as if it never happened,\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said, recalling the hundreds of National Guard troops and barbed wire fencing posted at the Capitol following the attack.Some lawmakers are grappling with whether to attend commemoration events planned on Capitol Hill for the one-year anniversary. On the one hand, members of Congress feel their presence can help send a message about being undeterred. But others, like Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), feel the day is \u201ctoo freighted with anxiety and anger\u201d for any kind of formal events. Not much has changed politically, either. Republicans are still afraid to criticize Donald Trump even though he is no longer in office, and even though he incited the mob to march on Congress, where they and their staff work, in the first place. When pressed, they shift the conversation toward more favorable ground: Joe Biden and his policies. Nevertheless, Trump continues to falsely characterize the harrowing events as a harmless protest that featured nothing more than patriotic Americans who rose up against the results of the 2020 presidential election. Some of his allies in Congress have echoed those efforts, endorsing quixotic attempts to \u201caudit\u201d the 2020 results more than a year after the election. Very few Republicans are actively pushing back on that kind of talk. The ones who are have been ostracized by their party. \u201cI am very aware and still disappointed at what I see colleagues who went through the same thing,\u201d Murkowski said, before pausing briefly. \u201cAnd yet it seems as if the further they get from that, it just didn\u2019t seem to have any impact.\u201d\u201cOr perhaps the facts look a little bit different than what they did at the time. That\u2019s always been discouraging to me,\u201d she lamented. \u201cIt seems like it\u2019s as if it never happened.\u201dThe rhetoric from GOP leaders denouncing Trump was strongest after the attack but soon wilted. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) rarely says his name anymore, deflecting questions about his influence over the party or the insults he hurls at McConnell himself. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has largely made up with Trump since calling him responsible in the days following the attack. He seems unwilling to anger him because it would likely hurt his chances of becoming speaker.\u201cThe people moved very quickly back to the posture they had prior,\u201d Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who along with Murkowski voted to convict Trump over the attack, told HuffPost. \u201cThose who decided to buy into the stolen election dishonesty helped fuel the anger that led to the insurrection of January 6. It\u2019s something that will be part of their personal legacy but I don\u2019t see a political price being paid.\u201dIf anything, parts of the GOP embraced Trump even more. Their campaign arm, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, is using his likeness to raise funds. GOP candidates across the country are echoing his false claims of voter fraud, in what has become a litmus test for the 2022 midterm elections. The seven Republican senators who objected to Biden\u2019s victory shortly after the Jan. 6 attack say they don\u2019t feel any remorse over their votes despite the fact that most claims of voter fraud have been discredited. Some still refuse to acknowledge Biden was legitimately elected president.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever really know because there wasn\u2019t enough investigation. I just hope it doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) told HuffPost when asked if he thought Biden was elected fair and square.\u201cThe process is here where you can object to something whether it\u2019s something like that, or a bill, or a nomination. That\u2019s what makes this country run,\u201d the former college football coach explained.Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), another objector, said that what happened on Jan. 6 was \u201cnot lawful.\u201d But he, too, shrugged off criticism of his vote challenging the 2020 election results.\u201cIf they want to be mad for the way I vote, then that\u2019s their right,\u201d Kennedy said of his critics. \u201cEverybody wants to be loved but I recognize that that\u2019s impossible when you do what you think is right. When somebody says, \u2018How do you sleep at night knowing some people don\u2019t like you?\u2019 my answer is, \u2018With the fan on.\u2019\u201dOther objectors with presidential ambitions, like Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Josh Hawley (Mo.), have only increased their standing within the Republican Party. Both senators continued to raise their profile by blocking confirmation of dozens of Biden\u2019s foreign policy nominees this year. \u201cI hope to never, ever see a riot here ever again,\u201d said Hawley, who raised his fist in solidarity with Trump supporters gathered outside the Capitol building before they stormed the building. There\u2019s little evidence that Jan. 6 and where various members came down on impeaching Trump and investigating the attack afterward has seriously affected working relationships in the Senate.Kennedy, for example, recently teamed up with voting rights advocate Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) on legislation designed to ensure veterans have timely access to health care, and on a bill honoring the Freedom Riders. Warnock also joined Cruz, who lodged the first objection to Biden\u2019s victory, in an effort to improve the infrastructure of their neighboring states. \u201cI work every day with people who refused to authorize an investigation of an armed insurrection at our nation\u2019s Capitol that ended up in the deaths of people who were defending us.\u201dThese kinds of quiet partnerships occur all the time in the Senate, especially on issues where there is little disagreement. What made these notable is that they involved senators diametrically opposed on an issue deeply intertwined with the Jan. 6 attack: voting. In an interview with HuffPost, Warnock said he wouldn\u2019t let the Jan. 6 fallout affect his relationship with members on the opposite aisle, even if some of those members opposed certifying the votes of millions of Americans based on bogus allegations of fraud. \u201cI\u2019m willing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do whatever I can for the American people,\u201d Warnock said. \u201cI\u2019ll continue working with my colleagues. I hope they work with us on voting rights.\u201dBut other Democrats said that the GOP\u2019s unwillingness to hold accountable those who contributed to the election falsehoods made it more difficult to get things done in a bipartisan way. \u201cI\u2019ve pretty much given up on that,\u201d Sen. Mazie Hirono (Hawaii) said. \u201cI just want the Democrats to lift the filibuster in order to pass voting protection laws. That to me is the most important thing we can do right now.\u201dSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) agreed. \u201cI work every day with people who refused to authorize an investigation of an armed insurrection at our nation\u2019s Capitol that ended up in the deaths of people who were defending us. That\u2019s a kind of a disagreement that goes beyond policies or home-state interests,\u201d she said. The bipartisan House select committee probing the attack has had some success so far, but it faces much resistance. The panel has stepped up efforts seeking to reveal exactly what Trump said and did in the hours that outnumbered Capitol Police officers battled hundreds of his supporters, calling for testimony from lawmakers and former Trump administration officials involved in Trump\u2019s effort to discredit the 2020 election. It also released new text messages sent to former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on the day of the attack from Fox News personalities, pleading with him to get Trump to urge his supporters to leave the building.Their work even has McConnell paying attention. The Kentucky Republican, who opposed forming a bipartisan commission of experts to investigate the attack, effectively killing it, expressed interest in what else the panel will uncover. There has been frustration that the committee isn\u2019t moving fast enough, however. Republicans will likely retake control of the House in November, giving them the power to wind down or quash the investigation entirely. Efforts to compel testimony or documents are being slowed in court by Trump and relevant witnesses in the meantime. \u201cI don\u2019t know the direction that the committee is headed, but they give me hope when I see subpoena after subpoena being issued. It shows me they will stop at nothing to obtain the truth,\u201d said Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn. More than 130 Capitol Police officers have retired or resigned over the past year, partly due to low morale and burnout following the Jan. 6 insurrection, according to the inspector general for Capitol Police. About 140 officers were injured during the riot and five have died since then.One tangible reform lawmakers have undertaken since Jan. 6 has been to allow the Capitol Police chief to unilaterally call in the National Guard for assistance when needed in the future. A congressional review found the lack of authority to request assistance was a key factor in the delayed response by the National Guard during the attack. However, there are still unanswered questions about the role the Pentagon played in sending troops to the Capitol. The deployment came far too late, and some see politics as the reason why.The attack on the Capitol may be in the rearview mirror, but it may not have been the last attempt at overthrowing democracy. Trump allies are positioning themselves for jobs at election boards across the country, especially in states that helped decide the 2020 election: Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Democrats worry the Trump wing of the Republican Party is actively laying the groundwork to succeed in 2024 where he failed in 2021 \u2014 by reversing or calling into question elections in the states before the results can even be certified in Congress.\u201cWhat has been the result of this democracy on fire? What happened here in the Capitol? That canister of bear spray has been replaced by bill after bill after bill,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in a recent speech on the Senate floor, referring to state-level GOP efforts to roll back pandemic voting accommodations and, in some cases, restrict voting access even further. \u201cThose flagpoles that were used to poke and jab at our brave officers that are here to defend us, resulting in several of their deaths, that\u2019s been replaced by repeated efforts to lie about the results of the election. What has happened to our democracy?\u201d she added. Those fears aren\u2019t shared by GOP lawmakers, whose party incidentally has also benefited from higher voter participation in recent elections. In New Jersey and Virginia, for example, people turned out to vote in record numbers and Republicans made impressive gains in both states.Asked recently by HuffPost if he\u2019s worried about the potential of future violence given Trump\u2019s efforts to install loyalists to election posts across the country, McConnell ducked the question at his year-end press conference in December. He answered by attacking Biden\u2019s proposed social spending and climate legislation, the Build Back Better Act, which has taken up the majority of oxygen on Capitol Hill.\u201cWhat I\u2019m worried about right now is hopefully seeing the end of Democrats\u2019 reckless tax and spending spree,\u201d he said. Then he moved on to other topics.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 New York\u2019s attorney general recently subpoenaed former President Donald Trump and his two eldest children, Ivanka and Donald Trump Jr., demanding their testimony in connection with a civil investigation into the family\u2019s business practices, according to a court filing made public Monday.The subpoenas, stemming from Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 yearslong investigation into matters including \u201cthe valuation of properties owned or controlled\u201d by Trump and his company, the Trump Organization, came to light after James went to court last month seeking to force the Trumps to comply.A state court judge who handled past disputes arising from the probe agreed Monday to entertain arguments over the subpoenas, which also seek documents from the Trumps in addition to their testimony.James, a Democrat, has spent more than two years looking at whether the Trump Organization misled banks or tax officials about the value of assets \u2014 inflating them to gain favorable loan terms or minimizing them to reap tax savings.The Trumps have indicated they will fight the subpoenas and are expected to file court papers through their lawyers seeking to have them thrown out. A similar legal fight played out last year after James\u2019 office subpoenaed the testimony of another Trump son, Eric Trump.Messages seeking comment were left Monday with lawyers for the Trumps and with the attorney general\u2019s office.Monday\u2019s filing was also the first public disclosure that investigators were seeking information from Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr. as part of the probe. It was reported last month that James had requested that Donald Trump sit for a deposition, but Monday\u2019s court filing was the first public acknowledgement by her office that it had subpoenaed him.As the legal fight over the subpoenas was heating up behind the scenes, Trump sued James in federal court last month, seeking to put an end to her investigation. Trump, in the lawsuit, claimed that James had violated his constitutional rights in a \u201cthinly-veiled effort to publicly malign Trump and his associates.\u201dIn the past, the Republican ex-president has decried James\u2019 investigation as part of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d along with a parallel criminal probe being run by the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office.James\u2019 investigators last year interviewed Eric Trump, a Trump Organization executive, as part of the probe. James\u2019 office went to court to enforce a subpoena on the younger Trump and a judge forced him to testify after his lawyers abruptly canceled a previously scheduled deposition.Although the civil investigation is separate from the district attorney\u2019s criminal investigation, James\u2019 office has been involved in both.Last year, then-District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. gained access to the longtime real estate mogul\u2019s tax records after a multiyear fight that twice went to the U.S. Supreme Court. He also brought tax fraud charges in July against the Trump Organization and its longtime CFO Allen Weisselberg.Before he left office last week, Vance convened a new grand jury to hear evidence in the investigation, but left the decision on additional charges to his successor, Alvin Bragg. The new district attorney has said he\u2019ll be directly involved in the Trump matter while also retaining the two veteran prosecutors who led the case under Vance.Weisselberg pleaded not guilty to charges alleging he and the company evaded taxes on lucrative fringe benefits paid to executives.Both investigations are at least partly related to allegations made in news reports and by Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, that Trump had a history of misrepresenting the value of assets.James\u2019 office issued subpoenas to local governments as part of the civil probe for records pertaining to Trump\u2019s estate north of Manhattan, Seven Springs, and a tax benefit Trump received for placing land into a conservation trust. Vance later issued subpoenas seeking many of the same records.James\u2019 office has also been looking at similar issues relating to a Trump office building in New York City, a hotel in Chicago and a golf course near Los Angeles. Her office also won a series of court rulings forcing Trump\u2019s company and a law firm it hired to turn over troves of records.___Follow Michael Sisak on Twitter at twitter.com/mikesisak\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Trends Reporter, HuffPostThe U.S. Marine Corps has discharged 206 service members who defied the deadline to get vaccinated against COVID-19, officials have announced.Despite complaints and early resistance from service members over the COVID vaccine, however, compliance is generally high. Overall, 95% of the more than 182,000 active duty Marines are at least partially vaccinated. More than 1.9 million service members have either been partially or fully vaccinated, according to the Department of Defense. The Air Force, with a Nov. 2 vaccine deadline, discharged 27 people in mid-December for refusing to get inoculated against the coronavirus, according to Military.com. Meanwhile, the Navy announced it would begin discharges for non-adherent members around the same time. The branch had the same Nov. 28 vaccine deadline as the Marine Corps for active duty personnel.Army officials last month discharged six active duty leaders, including two battalion commanders, and issued 2,767 written reprimands to soldiers for refusing the vaccination order. Officials aim to take further action this month against non-exempted individuals who refuse to comply with the vaccine requirements.Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin mandated COVID vaccinations for the military in late August. Last Tuesday, the Pentagon announced it is now also recommending a booster shot for all eligible troops and civilian members of the Defense Department. Nearly 100,000 active duty service members have already received boosters.The military hasn\u2019t been spared from disruptions in operations due to the virus. In the last week of December, the USS Milwaukee Navy combat ship was held up by a COVID outbreak. The ship docked at Guantanamo Bay after being forced to delay deployment to South America.Service members dismissed for vaccine refusal are protected from dishonorable discharge under the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act.

They were handed over by Trump ally Bernard Kerik, former New York City police commissioner and a confidant of Trump\u2019s one-time attorney Rudy Giuliani, Politico reported.Kerik was a key adviser to Trump\u2019s legal team trying to cook up a narrative of fraud in the presidential election Joe Biden won.Besides the documents Kerik turned over to the committee, he also offered a log of documents he refused to provide, including the Trump letter, according to Politico.Among the documents withheld is one described as a \u201cDraft Letter from POTUS to Seize Evidence in the Interest of National Security for the 2020 Elections.\u201dThough Trump ultimately didn\u2019t take action to seize election materials, such a letter could be a key piece of information in the investigation into Trump\u2019s strategy to undermine a legitimate election.Authorities have found no evidence of any notable fraud in the 2020 presidential election.The letter was created Dec. 17, 2020, a day before Trump met in the Oval Office with advisers including retired Lt. Gen.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Millions of Americans watched the events in Washington last Jan. 6 unfold on live television. Police officers testified to the violence and mayhem. Criminal proceedings in open court detailed what happened.Yet the hoaxes, conspiracy theories and attempts to rewrite history persist, muddying the public\u2019s understanding of what actually occurred during the most sustained attack  on the seat of American democracy since the War of 1812.By excusing former President Donald Trump of responsibility, minimizing the mob\u2019s violence and casting the rioters as martyrs, falsehoods about the insurrection aim to deflect blame for Jan. 6 while sustaining Trump\u2019s unfounded claims about the free and fair election in 2020 that he lost.Spread by politicians, broadcast by cable news pundits and amplified by social media, the falsehoods are a stark reminder of how many Americans may no longer trust their own institutions or their own eyes.Several different conspiracy theories have emerged in the year since the insurrection, according to an analysis of online content by media intelligence firm Zignal Labs on behalf of The Associated Press. Unfounded claims that the rioters were members of antifa went viral first, only to be overtaken by a baseless claim blaming FBI operatives. Other theories say the rioters were peaceful and were framed for crimes that never happened.Conspiracy theories have long lurked in the background of American history, said Dustin Carnahan, a Michigan State University professor who studies political misinformation. But they can become dangerous when they lead people to distrust democracy or to excuse or embrace violence.\u201cIf we\u2019re no longer operating from the same foundation of facts, then it\u2019s going to be a lot harder to have conversations as a country,\u201d Carnahan said. \u201cIt will fuel more divisions in our country, and I think that ultimately is the legacy of the misinformation we\u2019re seeing right now.\u201dAn examination of some of the top falsehoods about the Capitol riot and the people who have spread them:In fact, many of those who came  to the Capitol on Jan. 6 have said \u2014 proudly, publicly, repeatedly \u2014 that they did so to help the then-president.Different versions of the claim suggest they were FBI operatives or members of the anti-fascist movement antifa.\u201cEarlier today, the Capitol was under siege by people who can only be described as antithetical to the MAGA movement,\u201d Laura Ingraham said on her Fox News show the night of Jan. 6, referring to Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan. \u201cThey were likely not all Trump supporters, and there are some reports that antifa sympathizers may have been sprinkled throughout the crowd.\u201dThe next day, Ingraham acknowledged the inaccuracy when she tweeted a link to a story debunking the claim.Another Fox host, Tucker Carlson, has spread the idea that the FBI orchestrated the riot. He cites as evidence the indictments of some Jan. 6 suspects that mention unindicted co-conspirators, a common legal term that merely refers to suspects who haven\u2019t been charged, and not evidence of undercover agents or informants.Yet Carlson claimed on his show that \u201cin potentially every single case, they were FBI operatives.\u201dCarlson is a \u201cmain driver\u201d of the idea that Jan. 6 was perpetrated by agents of the government, according to Zignal\u2019s report. It found the claim spiked in October when Carlson released a documentary series about the insurrection.Members of Congress, including Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., have helped spread the theories.\u201cSome of the people who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters, they were masquerading as Trump supporters and, in fact, were members of the violent terrorist group antifa,\u201d Gaetz said.Spokespeople for Carlson and Gaetz say they stand by their claims.In truth, the rioters are  just who  they said they were.One was a recently elected state lawmaker from West Virginia, a Republican Trump supporter named Derrick Evans who resigned  following his arrest. Evans streamed video of himself illegally entering the Capitol.\u201cThey\u2019re making an announcement now saying if Pence betrays us you better get your mind right because we\u2019re storming the building,\u201d Evans said on the video. \u201cThe door is cracked! \u2026 We\u2019re in, we\u2019re in! Derrick Evans is in the Capitol!\u201d Vice President Mike Pence was in the building to preside over the Senate\u2019s certification of Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. Pence went ahead despite Trump\u2019s pleas to get Pence to block the transfer of power.During testimony before Congress, FBI Director Christopher Wray was asked whether there was any reason to believe the insurrection was organized by \u201cfake Trump protesters.\u201d\u201cWe have not seen evidence of that,\u201d said Wray, who was appointed by Trump.___Dozens of police officers were severely injured. One Capitol Police officer who was attacked and assaulted with bear spray suffered a stroke and died a day later of natural causes.Former Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who rushed to the scene, said  he was \u201cgrabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country.\u201d The assault stopped only when he said he had children. He later learned he had suffered a heart attack. Fanone resigned from the department in December 2021.Rioters broke into the Senate chamber minutes after senators had fled under armed protection. They rifled through desks and looked  for lawmakers, yelling, \u201cWhere are they?\u201d In House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office, staffers hid under desks while rioters called out the name of the California Democrat.That\u2019s not how some Republican politicians have described the insurrection.Appearing on Ingraham\u2019s show in May, Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he condemned the Capitol breach as well as the violence, but said it was wrong to term it an insurrection.\u201cBy and large it was a peaceful protest, except for there were a number of people, basically agitators, that whipped the crowd and breached the Capitol,\u201d Johnson said.Johnson has since said that he doesn\u2019t want the violent actions of a few to be used to impugn all.Rep. Andrew Clyde, after watching video footage of rioters walking through the Capitol, said  it resembled a \u201cnormal tourist visit.\u201d Other video evidence from Jan. 6 showed Clyde, R-Ga., helping barricade the House doors in an attempt to keep the rioters out.Trump called the insurrection a display of \u201c spirit and faith and love.\u201dRioters also broke windows and doors, stole items from offices and caused an estimated $1.5 million in damage.

We fight like hell,\u201d he told those who would later break into the Capitol. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore.\u201dNow, Trump says he had nothing to do with the riot.\u201cI wasn\u2019t involved in that, and if you look at my words and what I said in the speech, they were extremely calming actually,\u201d Trump said on Fox News in December.Nearly two-thirds of Americans believe Trump bears some responsibility for the Capitol breach, according to a survey last year by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.___Babbitt died after being shot in the shoulder by a lieutenant in the Capitol Police force as she and others pressed to enter the Speaker\u2019s Lobby outside the House chamber.Babbitt, a 35-year-old Air Force veteran, was unarmed.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostIf you\u2019re a Betty White fan, you\u2019re familiar with that gut-wrenching feeling whenever her name trended on Twitter. On Friday, just weeks short of the TV icon\u2019s 100th birthday on Jan. 17, that terrible fear came true. The comedy legend and national treasure \u201cpassed away peacefully in her home in Brentwood, California,\u201d said her agent and friend, who confirmed her death to The Daily Beast. Following the news, Twitter users mourned collectively as the tail end of 2021 got even bleaker.Ryan Reynolds, who co-starred with White in 2009\u2019s \u201cThe Proposal,\u201d was one of the first of her famous friends to pay their respects on social media. He managed to perfectly capture how many of us are feeling about the loss of someone who brought so much joy and laughter into our lives during the span of her 80-year-plus career. \u201cThe world looks different now. She was great at defying expectation,\u201d Reynolds said of White. \u201cShe managed to grow very old and somehow, not old enough.\u201d He wrapped up his short but eloquent tweet by telling White we\u2019ll all miss her very much.\u201cNow you know the secret,\u201d he concluded.The world looks different now. She was great at defying expectation. She managed to grow very old and somehow, not old enough. We\u2019ll miss you, Betty. Now you know the secret. pic.twitter.com/uevwerjobSAlthough the news of White\u2019s death is very sad, and some of us will be bingeing on cheesecake and multiple episodes of \u201cThe Golden Girls\u201d tonight, we don\u2019t think White would\u2019ve wanted you to pour too much of your New Year\u2019s Eve champagne on the curb in her honor. She famously had a booze-fueled friendship with actor Jennifer Love Hewitt, and probably wouldn\u2019t want you to waste any of the precious elixir. White also loved joking around and having fun, which is probably why she and Reynolds retained a friendship for over a decade.

Two years ago, he even referred to her as one of his \u201cex-girlfriends\u201d on Instagram. But White was able to get one last dig in at Reynolds right before her death in a People interview published this week: She told Reynolds that he finally needed to move on from his crush on her.\u201cI\u2019ve heard Ryan can\u2019t get over his thing for me,\u201d she quipped to the magazine. \u201cBut Robert Redford is The One.\u201dReynolds naturally had a snarky response to the interview:I\u2019m absolutely sick of the media exploiting past relationships just to drive clicks. https://t.co/xV8v2vVvXBBut we think this Twitter user summed up the two actors\u2019 last public sparring match pretty well:At least Betty White went out giving Ryan Reynolds shit.

I don\u2019t think Betty ever feared passing because she always wanted to be with her most beloved husband Allen Ludden. She believed she would be with him again,\u201d Witjas said.A spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department told Rolling Stone they responded to a medical aid request Friday morning after receiving a call at 9:33 a.m.White would have turned 100 on Jan. 17. She recently announced a documentary of her life called \u201cBetty White: 100 Years Young\u2014A Birthday Celebration\u201d would hit theaters that day. Best known for her roles as Rose Nylund on \u201cThe Golden Girls,\u201d from 1985 to 1992, and Sue Ann Nivers on \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d from 1973 to 1977, White had a storied career as a performer.A consummate professional with unrivaled charm and wit, White appeared on the big and small screens, on stage and radio throughout her many decades in show business. White had work lined up right until the time of her death.\u201cWhy should I retire from something I love so much?\u201d she told HuffPost in a November 2013 interview. \u201cI\u2019m blessed with good health; I\u2019m blessed with being invited to participate in television, so why should I say, \u2018No, no, I\u2019m retiring.\u2019 To do what? Nothing that I could possibly find to do would be as much fun as what I do for a living.\u201dWhite was born in Oak Park, Illinois, on Jan. 17, 1922, to Christine Tess and Horace Logan White. She began her career in 1930s.After World War II, she landed her own radio program, \u201cThe Betty White Show,\u201d before hosting on Al Jarvis\u2019 TV show, \u201cHollywood on Television.\u201d From there, she earned a sitcom of her own, \u201cLife with Elizabeth,\u201d based on a sketch from \u201cHollywood on Television.\u201d Throughout the 1950s, she established herself as a TV personality.White made her silver screen debut as a Kansas senator in 1962\u2019s \u201cAdvise and Consent,\u201d but she didn\u2019t regularly appear in feature films until much later in life. Instead, she continued to build one of the most solid and consistent television resumes in Hollywood. Guinness World Records even awarded her the Longest TV Career for an Entertainer (Female) in September 2013.White\u2019s biggest hit was playing Rose Nylund on \u201cThe Golden Girls,\u201d but that almost didn\u2019t happen. White was originally cast as Blanche Devereaux, the more sexually promiscuous member of the group, but she switched roles with Rue McClanahan because of similarities between Blanche and Sue Ann Nivers, White\u2019s character on \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show.\u201dIn recent years, White\u2019s career had a strong resurgence. She won two SAG Awards for her role on NBC\u2019s comedy joke show \u201cBetty White\u2019s Off Their Rockers\u201d and she became the oldest person ever to host \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2010. (She also won an Emmy for that appearance.)Throughout her many years of acting, White also collected five Primetime Emmy awards and two Daytime Emmy awards among countless other accolades. In 1945, White married World War II pilot Dick Barker. They divorced two years later, and soon after she married a theater agent, Lane Allen. White has said they split because he wanted her to quit show business. She later met TV host Allen Ludden when she was a celebrity guest on his show \u201cPassword\u201d in 1961. They married in 1963 and stayed together for 17 years until his death in 1981.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 This time last year, the Republican Party was hitting bottom.Having already lost the presidency and House, the GOP would soon squander its Senate majority and watch with horror as thousands of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent attack last Jan. 6 that will be forever linked to the Republican president\u2019s legacy.What a difference 12 months make.Entering a pivotal election year, a resurgent GOP is poised to reclaim one, if not both, chambers of Congress and retain its lock on dozens of state legislatures and governor\u2019s offices. While victory is far from assured, the GOP\u2019s confidence is fueled by President Joe Biden\u2019s underwhelming poll numbers, a Democratic economic and social agenda that\u2019s faltering, intensifying concerns about inflation, and deepening frustration with the pandemic, which is unleashing yet another wave of infections upon an exhausted nation.But at its most basic level, the Republican Party\u2019s optimism is born of the same political headwinds that have shaped U.S. politics for decades. The party that controls the White House \u2014 Democrats, in this case \u2014 has a tremendous disadvantage in the first election of a new presidency. Adding to that challenge, Democrats are struggling to prevent a far-reaching Republican campaign to make voting more difficult for core Democratic constituents while installing a slate of election officials allied with Trump.GOP leaders are brimming with confidence.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a hell of a year,\u201d said Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who leads the national GOP\u2019s Senate campaign arm. \u201cEvery state that Biden won by less than 10 is now a battleground state.\u201dLest there be any doubt, Republicans dominated the off-year elections this fall across Virginia, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, where Democrats in races from governor to county recorder of deeds were defeated \u2014 or barely held on \u2014 in regions that Biden had comfortably carried by more than 10 percentage points a year earlier. Perhaps most disturbing for Democrats, suburban voters and independents who fled Trump\u2019s Republican Party in recent years shifted back \u2014 without him on the ballot.Democratic strategists privately concede that the party will be lucky to hold either congressional chamber in November, although the House may be in the most immediate peril.They point to the surge of recent Democratic congressional retirements, dozens of Republican-controlled state legislatures that are actively reshaping House districts in the GOP\u2019s favor, a struggle to enact all of Biden\u2019s campaign promises, and a disengaged political base \u2014 especially African Americans. Their priorities on policing and voting rights have gone unfulfilled in Democratic-controlled Washington, even after last year\u2019s supposed national awakening on race.Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said too many Americans believe the country is moving in the wrong direction. But he attributes the pessimism to lingering anxiety from a pandemic that will soon enter its third year. With new COVID-19 medication coming onto the market and expanded vaccine access for children, he predicted the country would return to a sense of normalcy by the end of March.\u201cWe know that the economy is roaring is some aspects. But it\u2019s about how you feel at this moment,\u201d Harrison said, noting that many people are still grappling with fear and anxiety. \u201cI believe in the midst of the first quarter, end of the first quarter, that feeling will start to shift.\u201dGOP ChallengesWhile Republicans believe the dynamics work in their favor, they face their own formidable challenges. Democrats believe that GOP efforts to curb access to the ballot, combined with a Supreme Court decision expected next summer that could dramatically erode or dismantle abortion rights, could suddenly galvanize Democrats\u2019 most loyal supporters.But for the GOP, perhaps no challenge is bigger than Trump himself.The former president has waged an unprecedented war against fellow Republicans whom he deems insufficiently loyal, encouraging primary challenges against sitting members of Congress and governors in more than a dozen states. At the same time, some Republican operatives fear that Trump\u2019s continued lies about election fraud could depress turnout among the millions of loyalists who believe his baseless conspiracy theories.\u201cWe just have to limit the damage that he\u2019s causing,\u201d Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who sits on the executive board of the Republican Governors Association.\u201cIf we have big battles in primaries, either we\u2019re going to nominate people who are unelectable in purple states or swing districts, or we\u2019re going to beat up our incumbents so bad that they lose the general election,\u201d added Hogan. He isn\u2019t seeking reelection because of term limits but plans to travel the country promoting Republican officeholders in Trump\u2019s crosshairs.That includes Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington State, and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski. The most vulnerable may be officeholders such as Herrera Beutler, who was among 10 House Republicans voting to impeach Trump for inspiring the January attack on the Capitol.Two of the 10 have already announced they\u2019re not seeking reelection.Republican officials tasked with leading the GOP\u2019s 2022 election efforts are disturbed by Trump\u2019s sustained attacks on fellow party members, although few are willing to speak out publicly against him. Instead, Republican candidates in Arizona, Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and elsewhere are battling each other in increasingly nasty primary contests for Trump\u2019s favor.With the primary election season running from March through September, GOP infighting is likely to dominate the narrative for months even as Trump\u2019s role in national politics probably still continues to grow.He considers himself his party\u2019s kingmaker. He\u2019s expected to play a more active campaign role next year after shying away from high profile governor\u2019s races this past fall in Virginia and New Jersey, where he\u2019s less popular with suburban voters. Already, Trump has endorsed 60-plus Republican candidates and plans to weigh in on dozens more contests. That including Missouri\u2019s combative Senate primary in which conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt recently begged Trump not to endorse Eric Greitens, a divisive former governor.Historic Headwinds For DemocratsEven if Trump\u2019s politics hurt his party over the coming months, history suggests it may not matter. Just once this century has the party holding the White House not lost congressional seats in the first midterm election of a new presidency. That was in 2002, after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.Democrats lost 54 seats in the House and eight in the Senate under President Bill Clinton in 1994. They lost 63 House seats and another six Senate seats under President Barack Obama in 2010. In 2018, Republicans lost 40 House seats under Trump, while gaining a pair in the Senate.Republican-controlled legislatures have aided the GOP\u2019s potential House fortunes by drawing new congressional districts that are even more favorable to the party, including in Iowa, Texas and North Carolina, where \u2014 with legal challenges still pending \u2014 at least two new districts will be safely Republican.Democratic legislators could pad their own advantages in places such as New York, but the GOP is positioned to help its standing elsewhere far more.Redistricting will not affect the Senate landscape, where Republicans have to defend 20 seats compared with 14 for the Democrats. That\u2019s a positive for Democrats, but six of the top Senate contests are playing out it states Biden won by no more than 2 percentage points or lost, including Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and North Carolina.Beyond congressional races, the stakes are especially high for Democrats in statehouses. Republican-run legislatures from Texas to Georgia have enacted laws making it more difficult to vote in response to Trump\u2019s false claims of voter fraud \u2014 a shift that\u2019s expected to have a disproportionate effect on Democratic-leaning African Americans and Latinos.Democratic governors will be playing defense in much-watched Michigan and Wisconsin, and trying to hold an open seat in Pennsylvania. All three races are probably Democrats\u2019 best chance to slow the GOP\u2019s years-long ascendancy in the industrial heartland. But the GOP currently controls the governor\u2019s office in 27 states, compared with Democrats\u2019 23, with 36 up nationwide in 2022.If Republicans win in Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin while holding those state legislatures, the GOP would take total control of state government in those critical Midwestern battlegrounds that Biden narrowly won. That could give Republicans the power to change voting procedures in the next presidential contest, as their colleagues have in other states.Prominent Black leaders have become increasingly concerned with the Democratic-controlled Congress\u2019 inability to enact federal legislation to supersede restrictive state laws. Senate Republicans have effectively blocked such efforts, while Democrats have resisted calls to bypass Senate rules that require at least 60 votes to advance legislation.Many Black voters, a group that represents Democrats\u2019 most reliable supporters, are equally frustrated by the party\u2019s inability to enact policing reform in response to the national outcry that followed George Floyd\u2019s murder more than a year ago.\u2018We Have To Do More\u2019\u201cYes, we have to do more, and we want it to be faster,\u201d said Stacey Abrams, a Democrat making her second bid for Georgia governor. She said Democrats must have \u201cdeep conversations\u201d with the Black community \u2014 \u201cnot preaching, but having conversations about what\u2019s being done and what it\u2019s going to take to get more done.\u201d\u201cI understand why people are despondent right now. This has been a terrible two years,\u201d Abrams said of the broader political landscape. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard for so many. And the promise of hope can be sometimes disappointing. But this is going to take a while. It took four years to get us where we are. It\u2019s going to take a little longer than a year to get us out of it.\u201dAt the same time, top national Republicans, including South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, his party\u2019s only Black senator, are leading a national GOP effort to prioritize electing more women and candidates of color to state-level offices.Republicans made unexpected gains with Latino voters in many parts of the country in 2020, and Virginia provided hints that some minority voters are sticking with the party even without Trump running. Republican Winsome Sears, who is Black and a former Marine, was the first woman of color elected as the state\u2019s lieutenant governor. Jason Miyares will become the state\u2019s first Latino attorney general.While Democrats will feature far more minority incumbents and candidates on 2022 House and Senate ballots, former NFL running back Herschel Walker, who is Black, has been endorsed by Trump in Georgia\u2019s Republican Senate primary \u2014 despite allegations of a violent past, including threatening his former wife with a gun.\u201cThe winning formula is getting people who are from Main Street. We look for the best candidates that are out there and we allow the districts that they want to represent select them,\u201d said Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, head of the House Republican campaign arm. \u201cI think that\u2019s what\u2019s changed around here, rather than having Washington say, \u2018This is the right person for the seat.\u2019\u201dAbortion PoliticsDespite disturbing signs as 2022 begins, some Democrats insist there is cause for optimism. The pandemic, the economy and inflation will be critical factors to the party\u2019s success. But no issue may be bigger than a looming Supreme Court decision on abortion rights. The conservative-leaning court is considering whether to weaken or even overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion across America.Democrats are hopeful that a major shift on the politically charged case would help rally suburban women to their side \u2014 voters who lifted the party in 2018, though polling this year hasn\u2019t been conclusive\u201cWe are the tortoise and they are the hare,\u201d said New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, head of the House Democratic campaign arm. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything to deprive them of the overconfidence that will lead them to take a nap while we go slowly chugging by them.\u201dFor now, however, the numbers are daunting for Democrats.Just 33% of Americans say things in the country are on the right track, according to a recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. Sixty-six percent say things are headed in the wrong direction. That\u2019s a stark departure from the first few months of Biden\u2019s term, when roughly half said things were going the right way.About one-third of Americans call national economic conditions \u201cgood,\u201d down from roughly half last March. Only 41% say they approve of Biden\u2019s stewardship, down from 60% in March.\u201cEven though the diagnostics are pretty tough for the president and Democrats, it\u2019s not because they love Republicans. The Republican Party has terrible standing with the American people,\u201d said John Anzalone, the pollster for Biden\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cThis isn\u2019t people defaulting to Republicans because they like them. And that can catch up to them as the environment changes.\u201d\u201cI have to remind people that there will probably be, what, $6 billion spent on this election cycle, and we\u2019ll spend $3 billion,\u201d Anzalone continued. \u201cWe have something to say.\u201d___Peoples reported from New York.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver\u2019s marriage is officially over more than 10 years after the award-winning journalist petitioned to end her then-25-year marriage to the action star and former California governor.A Los Angeles judge finalized the divorce on Tuesday, court records show.The pair had been married since 1986 when Shriver filed for divorce in 2011 after Schwarzenegger disclosed he had fathered a child with a member of their household staff years earlier.The revelation set off a tabloid frenzy, but Schwarzenegger and Shriver handled their divorce quietly and without lobbing accusations in court or in public.It\u2019s not clear why the process took so long. There were virtually no public actions taken in the case between the initial flurry of filings in 2011 and a resumption of court moves in June.Financial details of the settlement were kept confidential. Because the couple\u2019s four children together are now all adults, there is no child support or custody arrangement.Settlement papers say that neither owes the other any spousal support, but both reserve the right to seek it through the court in the future.Messages left with the former couple\u2019s lawyers seeking comment were not immediately returned.Schwarzenegger amassed a fortune playing action roles in the \u201cTerminator\u201d and \u201cConan\u201d film franchises after a successful career as a bodybuilder. After California suffered economic problems and widespread power outages under the administration of then-Governor Gray Davis, voters recalled the Democratic incumbent and elected Schwarzenegger, a Republican, to the governorship in a free-for-all election in 2003.Schwarzenegger put his film career aside and served two terms as governor. Within a year of leaving office, he admitted fathering a child, Joseph Baena, who is now 24, with a member of his household staff in the late 1990s. Shriver filed for divorce in July 2011.He has returned to acting sporadically since, with roles in \u201cTerminator\u201d and \u201cExpendables\u201d films.Shriver was forced to resign from her position as a correspondent on the NBC show \u201cDateline\u201d when her husband announced he was running for governor.She resumed her work as a television journalist after her husband left office, producing stories for NBC while remaining active promoting women\u2019s rights issues and reporting on and advocating for people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.In 2018 she authored the bestseller, \u201cI\u2019ve Been Thinking...: Reflections Prayers and Meditations for a Meaningful Life.\u201dShriver is the daughter of Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who was the sister of President John F. Kennedy, and of Sargent Shriver, the first head of the Peace Corps and a vice presidential candidate in 1972.Shriver and Schwarzenegger\u2019s children range in age from 24 to 32. The eldest, Katherine Schwarzenegger, is an author who is married to actor Chris Pratt.___Associated Press Writer Anthony McCartney contributed to this report.___Follow AP Entertainment Writer Andrew Dalton on Twitter: https://twitter.com/andyjamesdaltonBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Their feud, however, had seemingly cooled off in the intervening years until Diesel recently begged his \u201clittle brother\u201d Johnson to reprise his role in the franchise\u2019s tenth and presumably (hopefully?) final film.\u201cAs you know, my children refer to you as Uncle Dwayne in my house,\u201d he wrote on Instagram in November. \u201cThere is not a holiday that goes by that they and you don\u2019t send well wishes... but the time has come.\u201d\u201cI told you years ago that I was going to fulfill my promise to Pablo,\u201d Diesel continued, referring to their late co-star Paul Walker by his nickname. \u201cI swore that we would reach and manifest the best Fast in the finale that is 10! I say this out of love... but you must show up, do not leave the franchise idle you have a very important role to play.\u201dWell, consider the beef officially back on, because months later, Johnson has rejected the request and accused Diesel of \u201cmanipulation.\u201d\u201cI was very surprised by Vin\u2019s recent post. This past June, when Vin and I actually connected not over social media, I told him directly - and privately - that I would not be returning to the franchise,\u201d he told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cI was firm yet cordial with my words and said that I would always be supportive of the cast and always root for the franchise to be successful, but that there was no chance I would return.\u201dJohnson noted that he also \u201cprivately spoke\u201d about his decision to leave the franchise with the producers behind the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d films, who he said were \u201csupportive as they understand the problem.\u201dDespite what may have been Diesel\u2019s best intentions, Johnson said his post was an \u201cexample of his manipulation,\u201d explaining that he \u201cdidn\u2019t like that he brought up his children in the post, as well as Paul Walker\u2019s death.\u201d\u201cLeave them out of it,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cWe had spoken months ago about this and came to a clear understanding. My goal all along was to end my amazing journey with this incredible \u2018Fast & Furious\u2019 franchise with gratitude and grace. It\u2019s unfortunate that this public dialogue has muddied the waters.\u201d\u201cRegardless, I\u2019m confident in the \u2018Fast\u2019 universe and its ability to consistently deliver for the audience,\u201d he concluded. \u201cI truly wish my former co-stars and crew members the best of luck and success in the next chapter.\u201d Diesel has yet to respond to Johnson\u2019s comments, but previously said he took a \u201ctough love\u201d approach on set with his co-stars \u201cto assist in getting that performance where it needed to be.\u201dApparently, Diesel, who also produces the films, felt the need to step in to get the desired performance from Johnson.\u201cThat took a lot of work. We had to get there and sometimes, at that time, I could give a lot of tough love,\u201d he told Men\u2019s Health earlier this year about Jonhson\u2019s characterization. \u201cNot Felliniesque, but I would do anything I\u2019d have to do in order to get performances in anything I\u2019m producing.\u201dLooks like there will be no driving off into the sunset for these two.Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostMessages of remembrance poured in on Tuesday after former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid died at 82 after a years-long battle with cancer.Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, entered politics as an outsider who grew up in extreme poverty and rose to become one of the most powerful figures in the party. He served as Nevada\u2019s U.S. senator from 1987 to 2017, leading the Democratic National Caucus from 2005 until his retirement. \u201cSenator Harry Reid was a true lion of the Senate. He was as tough as they come. A great man, and a great leader,\u201d DNC chair Jaime Harrison (D-S.C.) said in a statement. \u201cWhile we lost an American icon, his memory will not be forgotten \u2015 and my hope is that we can strive to emulate his leadership and follow in his footsteps to create a better country for all.\u201d\ud83e\uddf5 I\u2019m devastated to hear about the passing of a lion of the Senate & politics @SenatorReid. He was tough, tenacious & man he loved Nevada! I met him when I was a House staffer.  He was a straight shooter & he understood the members of his caucus like the back of his hand.Reid was also the Senate majority leader from 2007 to 2015 before becoming minority leader when Republicans gained control of the chamber. As leader, he helped usher in major legislation including the Affordable Care Act \u2015 something that seemed impossible to cobble together enough votes for if it hadn\u2019t been for Reid.\u201cThe nature of Harry\u2019s and my jobs brought us into frequent and sometimes intense conflict over politics and policy. But I never doubted that Harry was always doing what he earnestly, deeply felt was right for Nevada and our country,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement. \u201cWhen Harry retired from the Senate, we both celebrated the fact that our many differences had never really gotten personal. Harry\u2019s and my paths in the Senate were roughly parallel,\u201d McConnell added. \u201cWe seemed to reach each institutional milestone within just a few years of each other. I truly appreciated the sincere and cordial relationship we shared behind the scenes when passions cooled.\u201dBarack Obama, who was president while Reid was Senate majority leader, said Tuesday that Landra Reid asked those who were close to her husband to share letters that she could read to him in his last days. Obama released his letter in lieu of a statement:\u201cI got the news that the health situation has taken a rough turn, and that it\u2019s hard to talk on the phone. Which, let\u2019s face it, is not that big of a change cause you never liked to talk on the phone anyway!\u201d Obama wrote.When Harry Reid was nearing the end, his wife Landra asked some of us to share letters that she could read to him. In lieu of a statement, here\u2019s what I wrote to my friend: pic.twitter.com/o6Ll6rzpAX\u201cHere\u2019s what I want you to know. You were a great leader in the Senate, and early on you were more generous to me than I had any right to expect. I wouldn\u2019t have been president had it not been for your encouragement and support, and I wouldn\u2019t have got most of what I got done without your skill and determination,\u201d he continued. \u201cMost of all, you\u2019ve been a good friend. As different as we are, I think we both saw something of ourselves in each other \u2015 a couple of outsiders who had defied the odds and knew how to take a punch and cared about the little guy. And you know what, we made for a pretty good team.\u201cEnjoy your family, and know you are loved by a lot of people, including me. The world is better cause of what you\u2019ve done. Not bad for a skinny, poor kid from Searchlight.\u201dPresident Joe Biden pointed out Reid\u2019s early boxing career and the toughness it lent to his politics:A son of Searchlight, Nevada, Harry never forgot his humble roots. A boxer, he never gave up a fight. A great American, he looked at challenges and believed it was within our capacity to do good \u2014 to do right.May God bless Harry Reid, a dear friend and a giant of our history.Tributes came from both sides of the aisle and spanned the generations with which he served and later mentored.Harry Reid was an outstanding leader and a friend. I have fond memories of working with him on important issues impacting working families, including the vast expansion of community health centers. Jane and I will miss him and send our condolences to Landra and the entire family.In the last two years, he would always end our phone calls with \"I love you brother.\" And that is what our forty year friendship became: a brotherhood, a trust, and a shared love for helping others. Rest in peace, Harry.Harry and I still talked frequently over the last few years. His calls were always classic Harry. Quickly got to the point. And then he would hang up. No flowery good byes. Always made me smile.Sometimes, in a quiet or difficult moment, Harry Reid would reach out. It was like he knew.His counsel, encouragement, kindness, and generosity was so deeply moving. It was sincere. And I will never forget it.Thank you, Senator Reid. Wishing peace and strength to his family.Harry Reid was one of the clearest thinkers I\u2019ve ever known. He could be extraordinarily tough, but he was always decent and good. He was a fighter but a team player, a mentor and a leader. He extended me kindness I didn\u2019t deserve. I\u2019m just so sad. May his memory be a blessing.Harry Reid taught us all how to campaign with conviction, govern with guile, and fight like hell for what you believe in.My thoughts go out to his family\u2014and to the people of Nevada, who have benefited tremendously from his work. pic.twitter.com/4VwpXADXRkHarry Reid was one of the most amazing individuals I've ever metHe never forgot where he came from and used those boxing instincts to fearlessly fight those who were hurting the poor & the middle classHe\u2019s gone but will walk by the sides of many of us in the Senate every day pic.twitter.com/8T9PiD7vY4An American legend. I learned a lifetime of lessons from this wonderful man. He inspired and educated so many - with great decency, principled convictions, and always a willingness to fight the good fight. May all who serve in public life aspire to be like the great Harry Reid https://t.co/kE1lZUPPiOWithout Harry Reid, the ACA -- including Medicaid expansion, which insures 616K Virginians -- doesn't exist.When Democrats lost big over it in 2010, he still hung on & won. I learned so much from his campaign that I applied to my first re-election in 2019.What a fighter.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "A federal judge on Tuesday refused to dismiss an indictment charging four alleged leaders of the far-right Proud Boys with conspiring to attack the U.S. Capitol to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden\u2019s electoral victory.U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly rejected defense attorneys\u2019 arguments that the four men \u2014 Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs, Zachary Rehl and Charles Donohoe \u2014 are charged with conduct that is protected by the First Amendment right to free speech.Kelly said the defendants had many non-violent ways to express their opinions about the 2020 presidential election.\u201cDefendants are not, as they argue, charged with anything like burning flags, wearing black armbands, or participating in mere sit-ins or protests,\u201d Kelly wrote in his 43-page ruling. \u201cMoreover, even if the charged conduct had some expressive aspect, it lost whatever First Amendment protection it may have had.\u201dNordean, Biggs, Rehl and Donohoe were indicted in March on charges including conspiracy and obstructing an official proceeding. All four of them remain jailed while they await a trial scheduled for May.Defense lawyers also argued that the obstruction charge doesn\u2019t apply to their clients\u2019 cases because Congress\u2019 certification of the Electoral College vote was not an \u201cofficial proceeding.\u201d Kelly disagreed.Earlier this month, another judge in the District of Columbia\u2019s federal court upheld prosecutors\u2019 use of the same obstruction charge in a separate case against two riot defendants.The case against Nordean, Biggs, Rehl and Donohoe is a focus of the Justice Department\u2019s sprawling investigation of the Jan. 6 insurrection. More than three dozen people charged in the Capitol siege have been identified by federal authorities as Proud Boys leaders, members or associates, including at least 16 defendants charged with conspiracy.Last Wednesday, a New York man pleaded guilty to storming the U.S. Capitol with fellow Proud Boys members. Matthew Greene is the first Proud Boys member to publicly plead guilty to conspiring with other members to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral College vote. He agreed to cooperate with authorities.Other extremist group members have been charged with conspiring to carry out coordinated attacks on the Capitol, including more than 20 people linked to the anti-government Oath Keepers.Nordean, of Auburn, Washington, was a Proud Boys chapter president and member of the group\u2019s national \u201cElders Council.\u201d Biggs, of Ormond Beach, Florida, is a self-described Proud Boys organizer. Rehl, of Philadelphia, and Donohoe, of Kernersville, North Carolina, served as presidents of their local Proud Boys chapters, according to the indictment.On the morning of Jan. 6, Proud Boys members met at the Washington Monument and marched to the Capitol before President Donald Trump finished addressing thousands of supporters near the White House.Just before Congress convened a joint session to certify the election results, a group of Proud Boys followed a crowd of people who breached barriers at a pedestrian entrance to the Capitol grounds, the indictment says. Several Proud Boys also entered the Capitol building itself after the mob smashed windows and forced open doors.More than 700 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot. At least 165 of them have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanor offenses punishable by a maximum of six months\u2019 imprisonment.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostShould Kim Kardashian West require a cup of sugar, a spare pair of Yeezys or perhaps even a co-parent to stop her children from going live on TikTok without her permission, she now needs not look too far. Amid his repeated pleas to reunite their family, Kanye West has plans to move directly across the street from Kardashian West, who\u2019s made it abundantly clear that they are never, ever getting back together, more than 10 months after the pair filed for divorce.The rapper reportedly dropped $4.5 million to move into a mansion that\u2019s just a stone\u2019s throw from the aggressively minimalist and extra Hidden Hills, California, abode he once shared with his estranged spouse and their four children. Earlier this year, Kardashian West officially acquired the home amid their ongoing divorce proceedings by paying West $23 million to become the estate\u2019s sole owner.West forked over a whopping $421,000 over the asking price to lock down the neighboring 3,650 square-foot, five-bedroom property, which includes a swimming pool and a stable for horses, according to TMZ. But it\u2019s apparently a \u201cteardown\u201d situation for West, who \u201chas a vision for the house and plans on starting construction ASAP,\u201d per an unnamed People source. The Yeezy founder has been on something of a real estate tear as of late. He put up his enormous Cody, Wyoming, ranch up for sale for $11 million, offloaded a $3.7 million bachelor pad and then purchased a new $57.3 million Malibu mansion within a matter of months. What\u2019s behind these recent money moves? Apparently, a desire to remain in Kardashian West\u2019s orbit, despite the reality TV star\u2019s burgeoning romance with one Pete Davidson. \u201cHe only bought it for the location. It\u2019s near Kim and the kids,\u201d the People source said. \u201cIt will be family-friendly. He wants to be able to have the kids over as much as possible. Living only in Malibu was making visits more tricky for Kanye.\u201dJust last month, West made his intentions clear, telling a crowd of volunteers at the Los Angeles Mission that he\u2019s intent on \u201crestoring\u201d his family.\u201cThis morning I felt so blessed to wake up, to workout and be able to drive to my house and see my wife and my kids,\u201d he said, according to E! News. \u201cThat\u2019s right. I said my wife and my children, and I want everyone to pray for my family.\u201dHe went onto to detail his plans to live in a \u201chouse right next\u201d to their former family home so he can be \u201cnext to my children as much as possible.\u201dThe proximity to Kardashian West also means that West will be able to keep an eye on Davidson\u2019s comings and goings, with many on social media joking about some potentially uncomfortable neighborhood run-ins.

After enjoying a movie date in Staten Island last week with Scott Disick in tow, they\u2019ve since returned to California for more down-low hangouts.Davidson was spotted driving Kardashian West\u2019s custom Rolls-Royce on Christmas Eve with the two later reuniting for a Boxing Day lunch at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Only time will tell if the pair plan to ring in the new year together, as Davidson is set to co-host the live special \u201cMiley\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve Party\u201d alongside Miley Cyrus in Miami later this week.Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostPresident Joe Biden conceded Monday that his administration has not done enough to ramp up COVID-19 testing across the country, after going on the defense a week earlier in response to questions about the lack of testing in the face of the rapidly spreading omicron variant.On a call with many of the country\u2019s governors and his COVID-19 response team, Biden acknowledged the testing shortage impacting states. The president spoke about how the country went from no over-the-counter tests in January \u2013 when he took office \u2014 to 46 million in October, 100 million in November and almost 200 million in December.\u201cBut it\u2019s clearly not enough. If we\u2019d have known, we\u2019d have gone harder, quicker if we could have,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe have to do more, we have to do better, and we will. \u2026 Seeing how tough it was for some folks to get a test this weekend shows that we have more work to do.\u201dBiden defends testing efforts amid reports his team was warned in October about need for more available tests:\"It's clearly not enough ... If we had known, we would have gone harder, quicker, if we could have.\" pic.twitter.com/HFX1uDYP58Biden added that the administration has also worked with Google \u201cso you can now search \u2018COVID test near me\u2019 to find one,\u201d and reaffirmed that the federal government is distributing 500 million at-home rapid tests for free to Americans who want one. He also said that the administration will continue to use the Defense Production Act to produce more tests.Biden\u2019s message on Monday was a stark contrast from last week in response to the nationwide COVID-19 testing shortage. When asked by a reporter what his message is to Americans who are unable to get tested and are wondering what took so long to escalate the response, Biden said, \u201cCome on, what took so long?\u201d\u201cWell, what took so long is \u2015 it didn\u2019t take long at all. What happened was the omicron [variant] spread even more rapidly than anybody thought,\u201d he said.\u201cIf I had told you four weeks ago that this would spread by \u2015 a day-to-day basis it would spread by 50, 100%, 200%, 500%, I think you would have looked at me and said, \u2018Biden, what are you drinking?\u2019 But that\u2019s what it did,\u201d he continued. \u201cNow, we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen from here. \u2026 But I do know that we\u2019re not going to be in a position, like I said when we \u2015 remember we were having a problem with masks and gowns and the like? I said, \u2018I promise you.\u2019\u201dThe change in response comes after a Dec. 23 report by Vanity Fair revealed that the Biden administration rejected a plan this fall to ramp up testing ahead of the holidays. A group of COVID-19 testing experts presented a strategy on Oct. 22 to the administration that called for producing an estimated 732 million tests per month and distributing them for free to Americans, according to a 10-page plan the publication obtained.On Dec. 22, Biden told David Muir of ABC News that he wished he \u201chad thought about ordering\u201d 500 million at-home tests \u201ctwo months ago\u201d \u2014 but the plan Vanity Fair said was presented to the administration in October did just that. The testing experts who presented the strategy were told by the White House just days after the proposal that their plan was dead, according to the publication. The same day, the administration instead announced an initiative to move rapid at-home tests faster through the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s regulatory approval process.When asked about the report on Monday, Biden said his administration \u201cdidn\u2019t reject\u201d the plan.Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "DALLAS (AP) \u2014 Sarah Weddington, a Texas lawyer who as a 26-year-old successfully argued the landmark abortion rights case Roe v. Wade before the U.S. Supreme Court, died Sunday. She was 76.Susan Hays, Weddington\u2019s former student and colleague, said she died in her sleep early Sunday morning at her Austin home. Weddington had been in poor health for some time and it was not immediately clear what caused her death, Hays told The Associated Press.Raised as a minister\u2019s daughter in the West Texas city of Abilene, Weddington attended law school at the University of Texas. A couple years after graduating, she and a former classmate, Linda Coffee, brought a class-action lawsuit on behalf of a pregnant woman challenging a state law that largely banned abortions.The case of \u201cJane Roe,\u201d whose real name was Norma McCorvey,  was brought against Dallas County District Attorney Henry Wade and eventually advanced to the Supreme Court.Weddington argued the case before the high court twice, in December 1971 and again in October 1972, resulting the next year in the 7-2 ruling that  legalized abortion nationwide.Weddington\u2019s death comes as the Supreme Court is considering a case over  Mississippi\u2019s ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy that\u2019s widely considered to be most serious challenge in years to the Roe decision.While that case was before the court, Weddington also ran to represent Austin in the Texas House of Representatives. She was elected in 1972 and served three terms as a state lawmaker, before becoming general counsel of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and later working as advisor on women\u2019s issues to President Jimmy Carter.Weddington later wrote a book on Roe v. Wade, gave lectures and taught courses at the University of Texas at Austin and Texas Women\u2019s University on leadership, law and gender discrimination. She remained active in the political and legal worlds well into her later years, attending the 2019 signing ceremony for a New York state law meant to safeguard abortion rights should Roe v.

They are free and in their homes,\u201d Herrera said.She said she had no additional information about the decision, though she noted that petitions were pending before the Supreme Court to commute the women\u2019s sentences.The three are among at least 17 Salvadoran women activists consider unjustly convicted and imprisoned following obstetric emergencies and who have been at the center of a campaign against El Salvador\u2019s absolute law against abortions.Several celebrities \u2014 including actors Am\u00e9rica Ferrera, Mila Jovovich and Katheryn Hahn \u2014 last week asked Bukele and El Salvador in general to let the women return home for Christmas.\u201cWe are grateful that our petitions are being heard and we trust that President Bukele is going to work to achieve freedom for the rest of the innocent women,\u201d said Paula Avila-Guill\u00e9n, executive director of the Washington-based Women\u2019s Equality Center.The Inter-American Court of Human Rights in November ruled that El Salvador\u2019s government had violated the rights of a woman identified as Manuela who was arrested in 2008 on charges of provoking an abortion and died in 2010 while in custody, leaving two children.El Salvador is among four countries in Latin America that ban abortion in all cases, even when the life of the mother is at risk and in cases of rape. The others are Nicaragua, Honduras and the Dominican Republic.

It marked the first time that a sitting president had joined the fun, the White House said.It wasn\u2019t the only tradition that the president joined in on Friday. Jill Biden answered calls to the the North American Aerospace Defense Command\u2019s Santa tracking service, another longstanding tradition for first ladies, and she was joined by Biden for the calls.At the hospital, the Bidens spoke with a group of children making lanterns as part of a winter craft project, asking each one what they drew on their lanterns. Some drew family, snowmen or other holiday-themed art.They both spoke to a child who said the hospital \u201chelped him when he was down.\u201d\u201cWell we hope we\u2019re bringing you some joy today,\u201d Jill Biden responded.The president added, \u201cYou\u2019re bringing us some joy, pal.\u201dBiden also pulled out his phone to show the kids photos of his new dog, Commander, a nearly four-month-old German Shepherd puppy. The dog joined the family this week and was seen playing with a handler on the South Lawn of the White House complex earlier Friday before the Bidens left for their visit to the hospital.\u201cHis name is Commander!\u201d Jill Biden told the kids. \u201cAnd this morning he was eating my slippers!\u201dThe president and first lady then sat before the hospital\u2019s Christmas tree, where Jill Biden read \u201cOlaf\u2019s Night Before Christmas\u201d to the kids, which was broadcast to hundreds of children in their rooms at the hospital.The Walt Disney Co. provided copies of the book for each patient so they can follow along with the first lady, the White House said. Each book includes a White House bookmark designed by her office.The annual tradition of a hospital visit by the first lady dates to Bess Truman, who served in the role from 1945-1953.Before returning to the White House, the two stopped briefly at a Jill Biden-themed Christmas tree set up on the street in D.C.\u2019s Dupont Circle neighborhood by a local business owner. The president hung the 2021 White House Christmas ornament on one of the branches, nestled between large cutouts of Jill\u2019s face dotting the tree.Back at the White House, the two capped off their Christmas Eve festivities by answering calls for NORAD, as they watched Santa soar over the United Arab Emirates on the Santa tracker screens. They took three largely pleasant phone calls from kids and parents, though one father capped off an otherwise polite conversation with the president by wishing him a happy holidays and adding, \u201cLet\u2019s go Brandon!\u201d before hanging up. The phrase has become widely used by conservatives as a stand-in for a more vulgar epithet against the president.Biden didn\u2019t seem to catch the caller\u2019s intent, however \u2014 he responded, \u201cLet\u2019s go Brandon, I agree\u201d as the call came to an end.

Metropolitan Police Officer Mike Fanone during the brutal attack on the U.S. Capitol, would be allowed to be introduced as evidence.Judge Jackson said that Rodriguez did not unambiguously and unequivocally assert his right to cut off questioning during his interview when FBI special agents asked him about assaulting Fanone.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A West Coast rapper known as Drakeo the Ruler was fatally stabbed in an altercation at a Los Angeles music festival where he was scheduled to perform, leaving fans of the young musician heartbroken.A publicist for the rapper, Scott Jawson, confirmed his death on Sunday to the New York Times and Rolling Stone. The artist\u2019s real name was Darrell Caldwell.Caldwell, 28, was assaulted Saturday night at the Once Upon a Time in LA concert, which was expected to feature several artists, including Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent and Ice Cube. Organizers called off the festival after the stabbing.A fight broke out behind the main stage shortly after 8:30 p.m., leaving one man severely injured by a suspect wielding an edged weapon, the California Highway Patrol said in a bare bones news release that did not name Caldwell. The victim was taken to a hospital, where he later died.The Los Angeles Police Department and Los Angeles Fire Department also responded.LAPD spokesman Officer Luis Garcia told the Los Angeles Times that no arrests had been made as of Sunday.Music journalists and fans delighted in Caldwell\u2019s unique sound and boundless creativity. His death highlighted the violent demise of other talented young Black musicians, including fellow LA rapper Nipsey Hussle in 2019 and the highly influential Tupac Shakur in 1996. Both men were shot.Snoop Dogg posted on social media condolences to Caldwell\u2019s family and prayers to those affected by the tragedy. \u201cI\u2019m praying for peace in hip hop,\u201d he said.Caldwell, who started releasing mixtapes in 2015 and this past February debuted his first album \u201cThe Truth Hurts,\u201d has been called \u201cthe most original stylist on the West Coast\u201d for his darkly comedic lyrics and deadpan delivery. His mixtape \u201cThank You for Using GTL\u201d contains verses recorded at the Men\u2019s Central Jail in Los Angeles.He grew up listening to acts like Hot Boyz, Boosie, Webbie and Dipset, but said it was a battle rapper named Cocky who influenced him to rap.\u201cHe was so smooth and calm while rapping, despite saying some of the craziest stuff,\u201d he told Billboard earlier this year. \u201cIt showed me you didn\u2019t have to yell or be loud to get your point across.\u201dCaldwell pioneered a type of rap called \u201cnervous music,\u201d with songs that were cryptic and dark, the Los Angeles Times wrote in 2018: \u201cHis cadences run counterclockwise to the drums, somehow both herky-jerky like a stickshift and swift and smooth like a luxury sports car it controls.\u201dCaldwell was released from jail in November 2020 after reaching a plea deal with LA County prosecutors who wanted to try him on conspiracy charges in the 2016 killing of a 24-year-old man. Previously he had been acquitted of felony murder and attempted murder charges in the man\u2019s death.The Once Upon a Time in LA Fest confirmed in an Instagram post that the event had been called off early, and did not give a reason.The festival was organized by Live Nation, the Beverly Hills-based live events company that was behind last month\u2019s Astroworld music festival in Houston, Texas.Ten people were killed and hundreds injured when a large crowd surged during a performance by the rapper Travis Scott.In an email Sunday, Live Nation declined to elaborate on the altercation or provide details on security for the event.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

And if you want to wear the hat, wear the hat,\u201d she said. \u201cI respect the fact that he knew exactly what he believed in and always stood by that.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Enterprise Editor, HuffPostSenior Reporter, HuffPostAfter months of haggling and negotiating over President Joe Biden\u2019s key domestic policy plan, the Build Back Better Act, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) appeared to pull the plug Sunday morning during an appearance on Fox News. \u201cIf I can\u2019t go home and explain it to the people of West Virginia, I can\u2019t vote for it. And I cannot vote to continue with this piece of legislation. I just can\u2019t. I\u2019ve tried everything humanly possible.

I can\u2019t get there.\u201d pic.twitter.com/HsgXgYms3eNot long after his appearance, Manchin\u2019s office released a lengthy statement confirming that he \u201ccannot vote to move forward on this mammoth piece of legislation,\u201d citing inflation, the new COVID-19 variant, the national debt and \u201cgeopolitical uncertainty.\u201dThe White House responded with a sharp statement early Sunday afternoon from press secretary Jen Psaki, who said Manchin\u2019s comments were \u201cat odds\u201d with what he has said to administration officials and that the White House believed Manchin had been working in \u201cgood faith\u201d to reach an agreement.\u201cIf his comments on Fox and written statement indicate an end to that effort, they represent a sudden and inexplicable reversal in his position, and a breach of his commitments to the President and the Senator\u2019s colleagues in the House and Senate,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cJust as Senator Manchin reversed his position on Build Back Better this morning, we will continue to press him to see if he will reverse his position yet again, to honor his prior commitments and be true to his word.\u201dWith only 50 senators among Democrats and those caucusing with Democrats, plus Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 tie-breaking vote, the Build Back Better Act cannot clear the chamber without Manchin\u2019s support. No Republicans support the legislation. At this stage in the negotiations, all sides appeared to have agreed on a $1.75 trillion price tag to fund investments in fighting climate change and social spending. House Democrats voted to pass a smaller infrastructure bill in early November based on promises from Biden he could secure Senate support for the larger social spending bill. Progressive reaction was swift and furious. Sen. Bernie Sanders, a strong proponent of the bill \u2014 who initially pushed a $6 trillion package \u2014 lambasted Manchin on CNN moments later and demanded that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) bring the package to the floor anyway. \u201cI hope that we will bring a strong bill to the floor of the Senate as soon as we can, and let Mr. Manchin explain to the people of West Virginia why he doesn\u2019t have the guts to stand up to powerful special interests,\u201d Sanders told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper.Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) was more direct. \u201cManchin\u2019s excuse is bullshit,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cThe people of West Virginia would directly benefit from childcare, pre-Medicare expansion, and long term care, just like Minnesotans.\u201dThe apparent death of the legislation is a body blow to President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party \u2014 it contained many key promises they campaigned on during the 2020 election that will now likely go undelivered. And Manchin\u2019s move may deepen the rift between congressional progressives and the White House. When the House reluctantly passed the smaller infrastructure package in November, both Biden and Harris cajoled the Congressional Progressive Caucus with promises they could get Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) on board for this legislation. In Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s (D-N.Y.) telling in a recent tweet, \u201cBiden *himself* came to House Progressives & told us was putting his credibility on the line to deliver BBB if CPC voted BIF.\u201dRep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) seemed to take aim at Biden and House Democratic leadership Sunday morning on MSNBC for separating the smaller infrastructure package from Build Back Better. Bush and several other members of \u201cThe Squad,\u201d a group of progressive lawmakers, voted against the infrastructure package for that reason.\u201cThere are six of us that have been saying this all along: Rep. Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. [Ayanna] Pressley, Rep. [Rashida] Tlaib, Rep. [Jamaal] Bowman, Rep. Omar and myself. We have been saying this, for weeks, that this would happen,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving those coupled together was the only leverage we had. And what did the caucus do? We tossed it.\u201dEarlier this week, Harris had a contentious interview with media host Charlamagne Tha God on Comedy Central, during which he asked Harris, \u201cWho\u2019s the real president of this country. Is it Joe Manchin or Joe Biden?\u201d An aide tried to end the interview before Harris scrambled an impassioned defense of the administration\u2019s agenda. But Manchin\u2019s knifing of Build Back Better on Sunday does mean that scores of key Biden policies won\u2019t become reality. The wide-ranging bill would have bolstered the American safety net in several key areas, including child care, drug pricing, health coverage and paid family leave.The legislative framework outlined a monthly child allowance, which would have continued the payments that began this year, using an expanded child tax credit. It also included child care subsidies, available starting next year, that would have been available to families with incomes as high as their state\u2019s median income. And there was a program where states could take advantage of federal funds to offer free universal pre-kindergarten. It also would have improved the health care system by bolstering the Affordable Care Act. Build Back Better extended subsidies on the Obamacare exchanges through 2025 and closed the \u201cMedicaid gap\u201d in a dozen red states that did not expand the program under the ACA. Medicare Part B also would have started covering hearing services, while Medicare Part D would have capped expenses at $2,000 per senior starting in 2024. Insurers would have been prohibited from making anyone pay more than $35 out of pocket for insulin. And drug manufacturers would have been penalized for raising prices on single-source drugs beyond the average inflation rate. The Department of Health and Human Services would have been instructed to start negotiating prices on 10 key medications.The House version of Build Back Better included four weeks of paid family leave for all workers in the private sector starting in 2024, though Manchin had already made clear he opposed that piece of the legislation. The apparent death of Build Back Better might close the window on the U.S. taking meaningful action on climate change during Biden\u2019s presidency. If there is any path forward on remnants of the Build Back Better framework, it likely won\u2019t include substantial provisions on fighting climate change. In his statement, Manchin repeated a claim he made earlier this year, citing supposed damage the legislation would do to \u201cthe reliability of our electric grid\u201d and that \u201cthe energy transition my colleagues seek is already well underway in the United States of America.\u201d Though it fell far short of what scientists and economists across the ideological spectrum said was needed to decarbonize the U.S. economy, the legislation would have been the largest single investment in slashing climate-changing pollution in world history.The bill earmarked about $320 billion in tax credits for companies that buy or build solar, wind, and nuclear power, and for drivers who buy electric vehicles, particularly models made in unionized American factories. The program would have lasted 10 years, twice as long as previous clean-energy tax incentives. About $105 billion would have gone toward fortifying the country against extreme weather, cleaning up disease-causing chemicals in historically polluted communities, and setting up a Civilian Climate Corps modeled on the New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps, which planted billions of trees and provided jobs during the Great Depression. Another $20 billion would have gone toward a direct federal budget for green spending within the government, including in costly and nascent technologies like next-generation nuclear reactors. That, plus additional spending to help farmers adapt to more extreme weather and store more carbon in their soil, would have brought the total climate spending to about $555 billion.The bill was widely seen as the last opportunity for the U.S. to enshrine a plan to cut emissions before likely losing control of Congress to Republicans. While there are notable exceptions within its ranks, the GOP has long been the only major political party in the developed world to deny the reality of climate change as a platform issue, and whose open fealty to the fossil fuel industry has made its leaders a willing bulwark against any policies to cut pollution.And that party is now favored to win one or both chambers of Congress in next year\u2019s midterm elections. Critics of decarbonizing the U.S. economy, including Manchin, have long pointed to the fact that emissions from China and India will likely determine whether the world warms 1.5 degrees Celsius \u2015 or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit \u2015 beyond pre-industrial averages. (It has already heated up by about 1.1 degrees Celsius).China\u2019s emissions eclipsed the U.S. in 2006, but Americans by far have the highest per-capita emissions, thanks to a reliance on dirty power plants and gas-guzzling vehicles. Carbon also stays in the atmosphere trapping the sun\u2019s heat for centuries, and the U.S. has contributed far more CO2 to the cumulative mess than China or India. That made well-funded, ambitious efforts like those the bill included key to providing the U.S. leverage to urge other countries to change course.

Isakson said he would \u201cnot be able to do the job over the long term in the manner the citizens of Georgia deserve.\u201dGeorgia\u2019s congressional delegation gathered to pay tribute to Isakson, with the late civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) recalling the close friendship they developed over the years.\u201cYou, senator, led a team that could cross the aisle without compromising your values. I will come over to meet you, brother,\u201d Lewis said before walking toward Isakson on the Republican side of the aisle. The GOP senator rose to meet Lewis halfway and the two embraced.\u201cI will come over to meet you, brother.\"-- Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) to Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-GA), Tuesday on House floor.They hug: pic.twitter.com/QmsJuCEogJ\u201cGeorgia has lost a giant, one of its greatest statesmen, and a servant leader dedicated to making his state and country better than he found it,\u201d Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cJohnny Isakson personified what it means to be a Georgian. \u2026 He answered the call to public service many times over his career.\u201d\u201cHis work to champion our veterans, deliver disaster relief for Georgia farmers after Hurricane Michael, and always stand up for Georgia\u2019s best interest in the U.S. Senate will live on for generations to come,\u201d the governor continued. \u201cAs a businessman and a gifted retail politician, Johnny paved the way for the modern Republican Party in Georgia, but he never let partisan politics get in the way of doing what was right.\u201dThe Atlanta native first made his bid for elected office in 1974 when he unsuccessfully ran for Georgia\u2019s state House, though he succeeded two years later. He went on to serve in the state legislature for 17 years.After Isakson lost Georgia\u2019s gubernatorial race to Democrat Zell Miller in 1990 and the GOP U.S. Senate primary to Guy Millner in 1996, fellow Republicans blamed Isakson\u2019s loss on him not being adequately anti-abortion. In the primary against Millner, Isakson ran a television advertisement in which he said that while he was against the government funding or promoting abortion, he would \u201cnot vote to amend the Constitution to make criminals of women and their doctors.\u201dWhen Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich stepped down after the 1998 midterms, Isakson ran for his seat and won. In 2004, he ran to replace Miller \u2014 by then a senator \u2014 but faced similar attacks in the Republican primary for his stance on abortion. This time, Isakson took a harder line on the issue, saying he would only support legal abortion in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. He won.Isakson was the lead negotiator on compromise immigration legislation that President George W. Bush tried to push through Congress in 2007. Bush eventually abandoned the plan after Republicans made their opposition to it very clear \u2014 including booing Isakson at the Georgia Republican Party convention that year.The lawmaker also supported limited school vouchers and was influential in crafting the Bush administration\u2019s No Child Left Behind Act. He also pushed a compromise bill on the contentious issue of stem cell research that would have expanded funding for the research while ensuring human embryos weren\u2019t harmed \u2014 but he ultimately voted against the final version of the legislation, which Bush later vetoed.As chairman of the Select Committee on Ethics and the Veterans Affairs Committee, Isakson at times clashed with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration on care for veterans, helped expand private health care options for veterans facing long wait times, and expedited the removal of problematic employees at the department. The senator also quietly rejected Trump\u2019s nomination of Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, the White House\u2019s physician, to lead the VA after Jackson was accused of creating a toxic work environment and drinking on the job.\u201cSenator Isakson was a statesman who served Georgia with honor,\u201d Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) said on Sunday. \u201cHe put his state and his country ahead of self and party, and his great legacy endures.\u201dReporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Washington Bureau Chief, HuffPostPeople of color nominated by President Joe Biden for administration jobs have faced, on average, a tougher and lengthier confirmation process in the Senate than their white counterparts.Over the past year, activists and supporters have noted instances of this, pointing to several high-profile women of color who seemed to face extra hurdles.\u201cI have observed it. It\u2019s very disconcerting,\u201d Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said.White House data shared with HuffPost confirms this trend.For white nominees up for administration jobs, it took an average of 95 days to go from nomination to confirmation. For nominees. of color, it took 101 days.Black nominees took an average of 98 days and Asian nominees took 107 days. Latino nominees took less time, at 94 days.Nominees who tend to be relatively uncontroversial traditionally get confirmed by voice votes in the Senate, which means that senators simply say \u201cyea\u201d or \u201cno\u201d in unison. But a nominee who faces more opposition is more likely to get a roll call vote, meaning that every single senator has to announce where they stand. It\u2019s a process that takes far more time.Fifty-six percent of white nominees have been confirmed by the simpler voice vote process during the Biden administration, compared to 50% of nominees of color.That breaks down to 47% of Black nominees, 55% of Latino nominees and 46% of Asian nominees confirmed by voice vote.White nominees have also received more support during roll calls. They were confirmed with an average of 67 votes, while nominees of color were confirmed with an average of 60 votes.Some of the most notable differences emerged early on, during confirmation of the highest-profile positions in the Biden administration.Merrick Garland, a white man, had a fairly smooth, painless path to confirmation as attorney general in a 70-30 vote. But Vanita Gupta, an Indian American woman, and Kristen Clarke, a Black woman, had far tougher, more drawn-out fights for other top Justice Department jobs.Gupta, a civil rights lawyer nominated for the post of associate U.S. attorney general, had widespread support from advocates and law enforcement groups, yet she faced a right-wing smear campaign that described her as \u201cdangerous.\u201dConservatives tried to paint Clarke \u2015 a civil rights lawyer nominated for assistant attorney general for the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division \u2015 as anti-Semitic, because of an author she invited to speak at Harvard while she was a sophomore there.Clarke and Gupta each received only one GOP vote in the Senate.Of course, not every nominee of color has had a rocky confirmation process. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who is Black, was confirmed easily and received bipartisan support.But during the Cabinet nomination process in particular, the examples of women of color getting held up were notable. Neera Tanden, the former head of a progressive think tank, faced intense opposition from Republicans over her past tweets criticizing them. She eventually withdrew her nomination to be Biden\u2019s budget chief.\u201cThe same senators who spent years defending the hatred and anger coming from Donald Trump decided that the tweets from Neera Tanden were beyond the pale,\u201d said Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.Deb Haaland, who is the first Native American to lead the Interior Department, faced Republican accusations that she was \u201cradical.\u201d When former California Attorney General Xavier Becerra was nominated for health and human services secretary, Republicans went after him because he was not a doctor \u2015 even though many previous HHS heads have also not been doctors. Haaland received four GOP votes in the Senate. Becerra received one. \u201cSome of these have downright been racist, the attacks have been,\u201d Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) said. \u201cParticularly women of color have received far greater scrutiny and attacks than any of the other nominees.\u201dMost recently, Saule Omarova withdrew her nomination after it became clear that she would not get enough votes to become head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Omarova, a law professor at Cornell University, faced smears from Republicans who alleged that she was secretly a communist intent on destroying American capitalism because she was born in the former Soviet Union. Like other people of color, Omarova was branded as being too \u201cradical\u201d to be in government. But she also faced opposition from some Democrats, who weren\u2019t worried about her being a communist but were concerned that she might be too tough in regulating banks. The office of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) did not respond to a request for comment. The disproportionate burden for people of color extends to people still waiting for confirmation. Of the top 25 nominees with the longest wait times who still have not been confirmed, 64% are people of color, according to the Partnership for Public Service, which tracks the confirmation process. In the top 50, 48% are people of color.That is higher than the makeup of Biden\u2019s total nominee pool. Forty-two percent of Biden\u2019s total administration nominees have been people of color, and 51% have been women, according to data from the White House. \u201cThe lesson these senators are sending to people of color is clear: It doesn\u2019t matter how hard you work or what you achieve. You will always be labeled an outsider, an exception, a threat.\u201dOverall, the process for confirmation has been far slower than it was in previous administrations, because Republicans have been consistent in trying to slow down the process. Biden has roughly 38% of non-judicial nominees confirmed, according to White House data, compared with 50% at this time for Trump and 68% for Barack Obama. (The pace is much quicker for judicial nominees; Biden has had more judges confirmed than any president in decades.) Loren DeJonge Schulman, vice president for research and evaluation at PPS, said that under Biden, it has taken twice as much time for someone to go from nomination to confirmation for a non-judicial post as it did during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration.\u201cPeople of color are clearly a significant part of the nominees who are not being able to move forward through this process,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of that is because the Biden administration has been really purposeful about nominating more people of color. But it definitely stands out to anyone who looks at it that they are a significant portion above and beyond what you would see as a representation of the overall nominees that are being held up.\u201dThirteen of the 50 nominees who have been waiting the longest are up for ambassador jobs. Many of them are career civil servants who, in the past, would have been quickly confirmed because they\u2019re considered qualified and uncontroversial. But currently, GOP Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas) and Josh Hawley (Mo.) have placed holds on dozens of Biden nominees for the State and Defense Departments, in order to extract unrelated policy concessions. \u201cAnother pattern that stands out to me is that when you\u2019re looking at the ambassadors \u2015 for several months, the only ambassadors who had been confirmed... were either former senators, former senators\u2019 wives, or prominent politicians and donors,\u201d DeJonge Schulman said. There are ways to get around these sorts of GOP blocks. Senators can ask for unanimous consent to move forward with a nominee, or the majority leader, currently New York Democrat Chuck Schumer, can file cloture. This week, Schumer filed cloture on 22 nominees, including some judges.But cloture is a time-consuming process. It requires hours of debate and roll call votes \u2015 precious time when the Senate is trying to move forward on other issues. To be clear, Republicans aren\u2019t attacking every woman or person of color up for an administration job with gender- or race-related criticisms. But the overall effect of their blockade has been that a disproportionate number of those individuals aren\u2019t getting through.And sometimes, the attacks are indeed more explicit. Topping the list of long wait times is Dilawar Syed, who as of Friday has been holding 289 days for confirmation to the No. 2 job at the Small Business Administration, according to data from PPS. Syed hasn\u2019t even had a vote in committee, because Republican senators have boycotted meetings on five different occasions, preventing Democrats from proceeding with business and holding a vote. Syed is a businessman who has stepped into public service roles both in California and at the federal level, leading engagement with small businesses for the Obama administration after the passage of the 2009 stimulus package. GOP senators say their blockade is unrelated to Syed or his qualifications; they want the Small Business Administration to take back loans that some Planned Parenthood affiliates (legally) received under the Paycheck Protection Program during the Trump administration. But previously, Republicans did go after Syed more directly. They questioned his allegiances because of his Muslim faith \u2015 and the fact that he was born in Pakistan \u2015 and implied that he might be anti-Israel because of his work with Emgage Action, a Muslim advocacy group. GOP senators backed away from that line of attack, however, when Jewish and other religious and civil rights organizations came to Syed\u2019s defense.\u201cThe lesson these senators are sending to people of color is clear: It doesn\u2019t matter how hard you work or what you achieve. You will always be labeled an outsider, an exception, a threat,\u201d Chu said. \u201cLacking any policy platform, Republicans need enemies in order to animate their base. And amid a tide of rising hate crimes and especially anti-Asian violence, they have decided that people of color are the most convenient. Their record of holdups and double standards speaks for itself.\u201dIgor Bobic and Arthur Delaney contributed reporting.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPostA Donald Trump supporter who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 and then bragged about her \u201cinfamy\u201d in an Instagram post was sentenced to one month behind bars and a year of supervised release on Friday.Gracyn Courtright, who was a senior at the University of Kentucky when she joined the mob at the Capitol, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper. Courtright pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of unlawfully and knowingly entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds in August. Images show her walking about the Capitol with a wooden \u201cMembers only\u201d sign that she eventually turned over to a law enforcement officer after being ordered to do so. \u201cInfamy is just as good as fame. Either way I end up more known. XOXO,\u201d she posted after the riot. \u201cCan\u2019t wait to tell my grandkids i was here!\u201d she posted with photos of her at the Capitol.\u201cI thought it was cool,\u201d she wrote in a private message to another Instagram user who confronted her about her conduct. \u201cidk what treason is.\u201dOn Friday, Courtright broke down in tears at her sentencing hearing. At first, she was unable to get through her statement, and was checked out by a nurse. When the hearing resumed, Courtright read her prepared statement while seated.\u201cI have so much shame from this,\u201d Courtright told Cooper. \u201cI will never be the same girl again, this has changed me completely.\u201dCourtright said she hates having to introduce herself to new people because she has to say her name out loud. She called Jan. 6 the biggest mistake of her life, and said she would do anything to go back and never go to D.C.\u201cI will forever have to fear applying for jobs knowing the instant they Google my name they will not see the hardworking student who had been on the dean\u2019s list. They will not see the girl that I know that I still am. They will only see the girl who trespassed in the nation\u2019s Capitol and took pictures to prove she was there and posted pictures thinking she was just so cool,\u201d Courtright said.Courtright said she didn\u2019t realize that she had entered the floor of the Senate, and had \u201cno idea\u201d what side of the building she was on. When she went home, she said, she looked up pictures of the Senate and House floors to see what they looked like.Courtright said that her comments on Instagram came when she was trying to defend herself after people criticized her actions on Jan. 6.\u201cI just couldn\u2019t take any more of the people telling me I was a horrible person, I just wanted to defend myself,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cBut, like, I understand that I am a horrible person.\u201dUnlike other Capitol defendants who entered the floor of the Senate, Courtright did not face felony charges because law enforcement did not discover the footage of her in the chamber until after she pleaded guilty. Had she been charged with a felony offense, federal prosecutors say, her sentencing guidelines would have been 15 to 21 months in federal prison.The judge noted that Jan. 6 rioter Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed while climbing through a broken window and trying to enter the Speaker\u2019s Lobby outside the House chamber, was killed at the same time that Courtright was entering the building.\u201cShe was on the House side trying to climb through a window, you went in on the Senate side,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cDid you know what was on the other side of some of those doors that some people were trying to break down? You see my point. That could\u2019ve been you.\u201dCooper asked Courtright if she knew how many people died on Jan. 6, and if she knew how many officers died by suicide after the Capitol attack.\u201cWas it cool to have been there?\u201d he asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Courtright replied.Cooper noted that many of the young congressional staffers who feared for their lives on Jan. 6 were around Courtright\u2019s age.\u201cThere were some folks just about your age, congressional staffers who were on the other side of those doors, thinking they had to call their family, because this may be it,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cYou probably saw enough to know that this wasn\u2019t a simple, peaceful protest.\u201dCooper also expressed confusion that Courtright didn\u2019t even vote in 2020.\u201cIn my view, if you or any citizen for that matter wants to participate in democracy ... casting an informed vote is the price of admission, that\u2019s the ticket to ride,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not sports, it\u2019s certainly not resorting to violence when your team doesn\u2019t win the game.\u201dThe FBI has made more than 700 arrests in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, and hundreds more arrests are in the works. The online sleuths investigating the Jan. 6 attack have found that more than 2,500 people entered the Capitol, and the FBI\u2019s Capitol Violence website features more than 350 people wanted for serious offenses who have not yet been arrested.Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) confirmed Wednesday that he forwarded a message to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Jan. 5 that was revealed in part this week by the House select committee investigating the U.S. Capitol riot on Jan. 6.The text outlined a legal argument that then-Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to interfere in the certification of the Electoral College count in the 2020 election as pro-Trump Republicans tried to nullify Joe Biden\u2019s win.Part of it was presented during a Monday hearing of the House select committee, but it was attributed to an unnamed lawmaker.Joseph Schmitz, a conservative attorney who once served as national security adviser on former President Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, sent the legal theory to Jordan, who then forwarded it to Meadows, a spokesperson for Jordan told Politico.\u201cMr. Jordan forwarded the text to Mr. Meadows, and Mr. Meadows certainly knew it was a forward,\u201d the spokesperson said.Some Republicans have complained that when Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) presented the text, he displayed a graphic showing only the first portion of the message, with a period added at the end.Jordan\u2019s office claimed the shortened version was misrepresenting his message.The full text begins with that portion and goes on to detail the supposed legal framework to enable Pence to overturn the election.It was as follows, according to news outlets including the conservative website The Federalist, which first reported it:\u201cOn January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all \u2014 in accordance with guidance from founding father Alexander Hamilton and judicial precedence. \u2018No legislative act,\u2019 wrote Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 78, \u2018contrary to the Constitution, can be valid.\u2019 The court in Hubbard v. Lowe reinforced this truth: \u2018That an unconstitutional statute is not a law at all is a proposition no longer open to discussion.\u2019 226 F. 135, 137 (SDNY 1915), appeal dismissed, 242 U.S. 654 (1916). Following this rationale, an unconstitutionally appointed elector, like an unconstitutionally enacted statute, is no elector at all.\u2019\u201dThe Jan. 6 committee took responsibility for adding the punctuation and acknowledged it had trimmed the text before publicizing it.\u201cThe Select Committee is responsible for and regrets the error,\u201d a spokesperson told several news outlets Wednesday.The text, partial or whole, demonstrates just another example of the pressure Trump\u2019s allies were applying on Pence in the lead-up to Jan. 6 to try to impede the pro forma counting of the Electoral College votes. Pence resisted the pressure, eliciting the wrath of Trump supporters, some of whom chanted \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d as they stormed the U.S. Capitol in an effort to halt the congressional process.Schiff argued Monday that the text served as evidence that Meadows was central to the pressure campaign and that the panel needed to question him about how he responded to the information. The House voted Tuesday to refer Meadows to the Justice Department for possible criminal charges over his refusal to comply with a congressional subpoena to testify before the select committee.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostThe U.S. House voted Tuesday to recommend criminal charges against former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows over his failure to fully cooperate with its committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.The vote was 222-208 to refer Meadows for contempt of Congress. Two Republicans \u2015 Reps. Liz Cheney (Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (Ill.) \u2015 joined Democrats who voted in support of the resolution.He will likely become the second associate of former President Donald Trump to be charged for evading the panel \u2015 following onetime Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who faces trial next summer. The committee subpoenaed Meadows in late September, ordering him to hand over a large number of records from around the time of the Capitol riot and to answer questions from committee members in person. Meadows cooperated somewhat. His attorney was in touch with the committee throughout October and November, and he turned over thousands of text messages and emails, but Meadows announced last week that he was done being helpful. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) will now send the resolution to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, whose office will make the final call on whether to prosecute Meadows. Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and vice chair Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) had previously floated a compromise, saying that Meadows could answer questions just covering the documents he\u2019s already provided because, they argued, those documents can no longer be shielded by executive privilege. Still Meadows refused.\u201cIn an investigation like ours, when you produce records, you are expected to come in and answer questions about those records,\u201d Thompson said on Tuesday. \u201cAnd because not even Mr. Meadows was asserting any privilege claim over these records, there\u2019s no possible justification for wholesale refusing to answer questions about them.\u201d\u201cMr. Meadows has no basis to refuse to testify,\u201d Cheney agreed. She also stressed the gravity of the panel\u2019s work, adding: \u201cThere has been no stronger case in our nation\u2019s history for a congressional investigation into the actions of a former president.\u201d Trump, she said, \u201crefused to act\u201d for 187 minutes while his supporters ransacked the Capitol.Debate prior to the vote was interrupted for about 40 minutes after Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) said Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) had offended another colleague, Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.), by neatly summarizing Banks\u2019 voting record. Banks was originally nominated by his party\u2019s leadership to serve on the Jan. 6 select committee but was rejected in part because some of his votes aligned with conspiracy theories about the validity of the 2020 presidential election.Hoyer was \u201cnot surprised\u201d that Banks \u201cdoes not want to see\u201d Meadows comply with the panel\u2019s subpoena because, he said, \u201cI believe that he fears the information that would be brought forward.\u201dHis remarks were ultimately kept on the record. On Monday evening, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack publicized a handful of potentially embarrassing communications from Meadows\u2019 files in a public business meeting, revealing that Fox News hosts, Republican lawmakers and Donald Trump Jr. were all among those who frantically begged for Trump to do something to quell the violence that had erupted on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6. \u201cHe\u2019s got to condemn this shit ASAP. The Capitol Police tweet is not enough,\u201d Trump Jr. texted to Meadows.\u201cPlease get him on TV,\u201d wrote Fox News host Brian Kilmeade, who added: \u201cDestroying everything you have accomplished.\u201dAnother text was unveiled Tuesday. Revealing how early Republicans were scheming to overturn the election results, an unnamed lawmaker texted Meadows on Nov. 4 \u2015 the day after the election \u2015 suggesting an \u201caggressive\u201d way for Republican-controlled state legislatures to intervene. The nine-member panel voted Monday evening to move forward with the process of holding Meadows in contempt of Congress, adopting a resolution that recommends criminal charges. The chairs made the same argument for holding Meadows accountable before the larger House the next day. As of last week, Meadows claims he does not have to cooperate with the panel because Trump wants to use executive privilege to block the investigation into the events of Jan. 6.Thompson and Cheney wholly rejected that argument, pointing out that President Joe Biden has declined to use that tool to shield the executive office. Executive privilege is the court-sanctioned concept that presidents should be able to keep some communications secret so that aides feel free to give their honest advice, and most presidents are loath to chip away at it. Biden has declined to use it in this case, given the unprecedented nature of the Capitol attack.Nevertheless, Trump argues that he should be able to assert executive privilege while no longer in office. So far, judges have ruled against him. \u201cBut all that discussion about different privileges is a distraction. That\u2019s not what this contempt referral is primarily about,\u201d Thompson said on Tuesday.\u201cThis referral centers on the information that even Mr. Meadows and his attorney say is outside all those claims of privilege. He provided roughly 9,000 pages of records that he and his attorney freely admit cannot be held back by any sort of privilege claim. They gave us a lot of information.\u201dCheney also lamented the state of division within her party, segments of which have shifted to downplaying the deadly violence seen during the Capitol attack. \u201cWe all, on this side of the aisle, used to be in agreement about what happened on Jan. 6,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cThere was a brief period of time \u2015 days, perhaps \u2015 where we were in agreement.\u201dA third person, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, may be held in contempt of Congress in the coming weeks. The committee agreed to a resolution recommending charges against Clark earlier this month, but the full House has yet to take it up. Clark is expected to exercise his right under the Fifth Amendment to not testify before the panel when he appears for a scheduled deposition Thursday.Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Social Justice ReporterLast month, a jury found three white men, Travis and Gregory McMichael and William Bryan, guilty of murdering Ahmaud Arbery as the 25-year-old Black man jogged through their Georgia neighborhood in early 2020. The defendants had claimed they were merely trying to execute a citizen\u2019s arrest on Arbery, who they falsely believed was responsible for a series of burglaries in the area.Georgia repealed its citizen\u2019s arrest laws in the wake of Arbery\u2019s murder. New language in the bill allows only business employees, not every private citizen, to detain people they believe have stolen something \u2014 such as restaurant employees who detain people who didn\u2019t pay for a meal. But 41 states still have citizen\u2019s arrest laws, according to a database from Solutions Institute, an activist consulting firm, and even those that don\u2019t often have case law in state courts that protects the act of a private citizen acting like a police officer and arresting a fellow citizen.South Carolina, for example, gives people the right to kill in self-defense during a citizen\u2019s arrest. A Connecticut code allows a private person to use deadly force in a situation calling for self-defense but not if deadly force can be avoided. In Mississippi and Alabama, the justification for a citizen\u2019s arrest is loose, granting people arrest powers even if the alleged crime didn\u2019t happen in their presence. Although Georgia\u2019s modification to the citizen\u2019s arrest law was welcomed by many experts, some don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything but a nibble at the larger problem.\u201cGenerally speaking, I think all these laws should be abolished,\u201d said Ira P. Robbins, a legal scholar and professor at American University\u2019s Washington College of Law. \u201cWe don\u2019t need people taking the law into their own hands, and we don\u2019t need defendants to raise citizen\u2019s arrest in their defense. The claim in the [Arbery] case was an invalid citizen\u2019s arrest.\u201dRobbins likened the citizen\u2019s arrest statute to the federal Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. That law required enslaved people to be returned to their owners and allowed citizens to capture them. Thirteen years later, in 1863 amid the Civil War, Georgia passed its citizen\u2019s arrest law.\u201cI think that is hardly a coincidence,\u201d Robbins said. \u201cIt is bad enough to have cops doing improper policing, and when you layer that on with citizens with racist motives taking the law into their own hands, you end up with a lawless society.\u201dArbery\u2019s case was not the first in which Georgia\u2019s citizen\u2019s arrest law led to violence. Hannah Payne was indicted by a grand jury on felony murder, aggravated assault, malice murder and false imprisonment charges stemming from the May 2019 shooting of a Black man, 62-year-old Kenneth Herring. According to police reports, Payne followed Herring\u2019s pickup after she saw it hit another vehicle near a highway. After calling 911, she blocked Herring near an intersection and confronted him with a gun. She later shot him, ignoring the instructions of 911 dispatchers.Payne\u2019s attorney characterized her lethal act as self-defense in the manner of a citizen\u2019s arrest.Her trial has been delayed until next year.Arbery, 25, was fatally shot by Travis McMichael on Feb. 23, 2020, in the Satilla Shores neighborhood of Brunswick, Georgia. He and his father, Gregory McMichael, said they approached Arbery because he was seen trespassing at a construction site, though surveillance footage had captured multiple people walking through the site.After the murder, Travis McMichael claimed he shot Arbery in self-defense. His testimony during the trial shifted several times as he gave an account of what happened prior to and during the shooting.The property owner said nothing was ever taken from the construction site, including on the day Arbery was chased and killed.\u201cThese laws are outdated, and they don\u2019t make any sense in a modern society with law enforcement,\u201d said Neama Rahmani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers.But the laws are in place almost everywhere. In Virginia, private citizens are allowed to execute a citizen\u2019s arrest simply if there is a breach of peace in their presence. Maryland allows a citizen\u2019s arrest if a felony is committed either in a private citizen\u2019s presence or even outside of the person\u2019s presence if they have probable cause to believe the person committed one.Definitions of what some states legally consider a citizen\u2019s arrest can be obscure. For example, in North Carolina the law allows private citizens to detain an individual but not arrest them, but with no real guidance on how to make that distinction. A Pennsylvania statute says private citizens can arrest another person only if the other person has committed a felony, misdemeanor or breach of peace. The statute also allows the person committing or assisting in the arrest to use deadly force only in a case of self-defense. Since Arbery\u2019s murder, some elected officials have taken note of these problematic laws and worked to combat them.Under South Carolina\u2019s citizen\u2019s arrest law, private citizens are able to take a person\u2019s life in self-defense. Anyone is also able to conduct a citizen\u2019s arrest if they witness a felony or a theft or have information that the specific person detained had committed the crime. Justin Bamberg, a Democratic lawmaker in South Carolina\u2019s state House, filed a bill to repeal the citizen\u2019s arrest statute in May 2020, just months after Arbery\u2019s killing and around the time the video of the fatal shooting was released.Bamberg said the law came from a \u201cdark place\u201d and enabled white communities to take it upon themselves to \u201cpolice Black people.\u201dBamberg refers to the people who carry out citizen\u2019s arrest as vigilantes. He says the statutes should be outlawed nationwide because the country does not need them in the 21st century.\u201cIn our state, people are allowed to kill,\u201d Bamberg told HuffPost. \u201cIt does not take into account if you are factually wrong or inherently prejudice. Even today, if you take the racial component out of it, it is still a problematic law because citizens with no training should not be out here trying to arrest folks.\u201dHis bill stalled. He plans to file it again.

Prior to \u201cThe Bachelorette,\u201d Brown was among the 30 contestants vying for Underwood\u2019s heart on Season 23 of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d in 2019. In her interview with Collins, she said she\u2019d watched \u201cComing Out Colton.\u201dBrown acknowledged it was a \u201cweird\u201d experience at first, given her romantic history with the show\u2019s subject. By the series\u2019 end, however, she was impressed.\u201cI think I like him better as a gay man,\u201d Brown said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s obvious that he\u2019s still almost, like, uncomfortable with this new life because he has never allowed himself to be who he is ... it is cool to kind of just watch him try to be his most authentic self for the first time.\u201dCatch a clip of Brown\u2019s interview on \u201cThe Michelle Collins Show\u201d below. By all accounts, \u201cComing Out Colton\u201d has divided longtime \u201cBachelor\u201d fans and members of the LGBTQ community. Some, like former *NSYNC star Lance Bass, suggested Underwood was \u201cmonetizing\u201d the coming-out process. Others criticized Netflix for its perceived glorification of Underwood, who was hit with a restraining order last year following accusations he\u2019d stalked his ex-girlfriend, \u201cBachelor\u201d star Cassie Randolph. And as for Randolph herself, E! News reported this month that she \u201cthinks it\u2019s inappropriate that Colton has continuously spoken about their relationship,\u201d but nonetheless \u201cunderstands it\u2019s part of his journey.\u201d Brown \u2015 who is currently promoting a memoir, \u201cGod Bless This Mess\u201d \u2015 acknowledged much of that criticism, stressing, \u201cI think there\u2019s two sides to it.\u201d \u201cI understand why people would be upset that he has a TV show just because he\u2019s a white gay man and, you know, there\u2019s some privilege there,\u201d Brown said. \u201cAnd I also understand [that with] his relationship with Cassie, I think he definitely made a lot of mistakes.\u201dElsewhere in the interview, Brown said she believed \u201ca lot of the [contestants] knew\u201d about Underwood\u2019s sexuality while on the series. \u201cUltimately, I\u2019m all about people understanding more of who they are and growing and not being just defined by all their past mistakes,\u201d she added. Though \u201cComing Out Colton\u201d largely steers clear of Underwood\u2019s love life, the Indiana native recently went Instagram-official with boyfriend Jordan C. Brown.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2015 An email authored by Donald Trump\u2019s chief of staff in the run-up to the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol may help explain military leaders\u2019 reluctance to deploy troops that day: Doing so could have forced troops to choose between following the orders of their direct commanders or obeying the commander in chief of the United States armed forces.Mark Meadows wrote that the National Guard would be deployed to \u201c\u2018protect pro Trump people\u2019 and that many more would be available on standby,\u201d according to the resolution by the House committee investigating Jan. 6 that recommends referring criminal contempt of Congress charges against Meadows to the Department of Justice.The resolution did not specify the recipient of that note or when it was sent.Top military officials in the Trump administration\u2019s final days have previously said they were concerned that Trump would try to use the military to remain in power. At the time, describing his goals through the end of Trump\u2019s term, acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller told associates \u201cNo military coup, no major war, and no troops in the streets,\u201d according to the book \u201cBetrayal,\u201d by ABC\u2019s Jon Karl.Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley also worried about a coup, and told colleagues that Trump had become \u201cthe classic authoritarian leader with nothing to lose,\u201d according to the book \u201cI Alone Can Fix It,\u201d by Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker.One source familiar with the Jan. 6 committee\u2019s work said the worry about troops potentially receiving \u201cconflicting orders\u201d \u2015 one set via the non-political military chain of command, to protect the constitutional process, and the other from Trump himself, designed to let him retain power \u2015 was a real concern in early January.Indeed, every single living former defense secretary, including the two who had served under Trump, signed on to an extraordinary op-ed published in The Washington Post on Jan. 3, reminding service members that it was both inappropriate and illegal to get involved with elections.\u201cEfforts to involve the U.S. armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory,\u201d the former secretaries wrote. \u201cCivilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic.\u201dConcerns about having thousands of National Guard troops on the ground on Jan. 6, and susceptible to Trump\u2019s attempts to use them for his own ends, were part of a broader worry that Trump would try to abuse his power as commander in chief to remain in the White House despite losing the 2020 election.Top Trump White House aide Peter Navarro has repeatedly complained on Trump adviser Stephen Bannon\u2019s podcast that the military leadership refused to back Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election, which he, like Trump, falsely claims was fraudulent.Another Trump confidant, his first national security adviser Mike Flynn, actually recommended that Trump invoke martial law to seize voting machines in states Joe Biden had won, and force them to hold their elections a second time. A similar plan was laid out in a 38-page slideshow in Meadows\u2019 possession that he turned over to the Jan. 6 committee. Under this plan, Trump forces would seize all the ballots and hand them over to a Trump partisan for hand-counting.Trump did not go along with these schemes, though, after top officials at the White House, including the lawyers in the counsel\u2019s office, threatened to resign en masse if he did.However, Meadows, the highest-ranking White House official, continued to push false election conspiracy theories, bringing their proponents to visit with Trump directly, one senior Trump White House staffer said on condition of anonymity.Meadows did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s queries about his email.Monday evening, the House committee voted unanimously to refer criminal contempt charges to the Justice Department. It now goes to the full House for a vote.Meadows becomes the third Trump associate to be referred by the committee for contempt, along with former Justice Department lawyer Jeffrey Clark and top Trump White House aide Stephen Bannon. Clark\u2019s referral is awaiting a vote by the House, while Bannon has already been indicted by a grand jury.Trump, who lost the election by 7 million votes nationally and 306-232 in the Electoral College, became the first president in more than two centuries of U.S. elections to refuse to hand over power peacefully. His incitement of the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol \u2015 a last-ditch attempt to remain in office \u2015 killed five people, including one police officer, as well as injuring another 140 officers and leading to four police suicides.Despite this, Trump remains the dominant figure in the Republican Party and is openly speaking about running for the presidency again in 2024.Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

But we\u2019ve adapted to live in less air.\u201dSome researchers have discussed geoengineering as a way to reverse climate change by affecting weather and climate patterns with methods like removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or increasing the reflectivity of the Earth.Though the concept is a source of legitimate debate, it\u2019s at the root of a number of conspiracy theories, the followers of which believe that these practices are already being carried out in secret so the government can control the weather. There is no evidence that this is the case.Jones then suggested that Biden may have \u201cordered\u201d that the power be turned off in Texas in February, when the state was hit by a historic winter storm that led to widespread power outages.He added: \u201cSo the question is did they use weather weapons to cause the tornadoes? That\u2019s a legitimate question to ask.\u201dBiden will travel to Kentucky on Wednesday to survey the areas hit hardest by the storms, which killed at least 74 people in Kentucky and 14 in other states. The tornadoes were some of the deadliest in recent U.S. history.Watch Jones\u2019 comments below via Media Matters.Senior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPostA QAnon believer who arrived with weapons in Washington, D.C., just after the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, and threatened to kill former President Donald Trump\u2019s political opponents, was sentenced to 28 months behind bars on Tuesday.Cleveland Grover Meredith Jr., a 53-year-old from Hayesville, North Carolina, was arrested on Jan. 7 after he sent threats about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and others to a relative from Georgia. The relative contacted Meredith\u2019s mother, who reached out to the FBI.When FBI special agents found Meredith at a Holiday Inn about a mile from the U.S. Capitol, there was a handgun, a rifle, about 2,500 rounds of ammunition and 10 large-capacity ammunition feeding devices inside his trailer.Meredith will get credit for the 11 months he\u2019s already served behind bars. The defendant\u2019s mental health issues played a role in his sentence.Meredith had written to his relative that he was \u201c[t]hinking about heading over to Pelosi C[**]T\u2019s speech and putting a bullet in her noggin on Live TV \ud83d\ude08.\u201d \u201cI ain\u2019t goin to jail, the morgue maybe, not jail,\u201d he wrote to his relative.When a friend wrote that \u201cTrump wants you to go home peacefully,\u201d Meredith said that was nonsense.\u201cBullshit, he wants HEADS and I\u2019m gonna deliver,\u201d he wrote.Meredith\u2019s mother said his family had encouraged him to seek mental heath treatment but that he\u2019d refused to follow through, according to the FBI.Meredith was sentenced by Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who\u2019d previously ordered him held until trial, saying that \u201cno condition or combination of conditions will ensure the safety of the community\u201d if he was released. Meredith pleaded guilty in September to one count of making felony threats as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors.Jackson said she factored in Meredith\u2019s cooperation with the FBI, as well as the fact that he shared his threats with a relative rather than sending them to the actual target. She also cited his positive behavior behind bars. But, the judge said, deterrence plays an important role in resolving the ongoing Jan. 6 cases.\u201cThe heated, inflammatory rhetoric that brought the defendant to the District has not subsided. The lie that the election was stolen and illegitimate is still being perpetrated \u2015 indeed, it\u2019s being amplified, not only on social media but on mainstream media outlets,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cWorse, it\u2019s become heresy for a member of the [former] president\u2019s party to say otherwise.\u201dIt needs to be \u201ccrystal clear,\u201d Jackson said, that it is not patriotism to descend on the nation\u2019s capital \u201cat the direction of a disappointed candidate\u201d and threaten members of the other party.\u201cCanceling out the votes of others at the point of a gun is the utter anthesis of what America stands for,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is the definition of tyranny and of authoritarianism.\u201d Jackson said political debate in the U.S. has become \u201cdebased\u201d and threats have increased, and said laws needed to be enforced.Meredith\u2019s attorneys had asked for time served. They said their client struggled to \u201cfind a sense of purpose and significance\u201d after the death of his younger sister when he was in his early 20s, and that he often told people \u201che should have been the one to die.\u201d He later got married and had two children, and ran two car washing businesses while being \u201cplagued with deepening, largely untreated mental health issues.\u201d His life \u201cbegan to fall apart\u201d in his mid-40s, the defense team said.After Meredith moved from Georgia to North Carolina in September 2020, he became \u201cdeeply immersed in QAnon\u201d and \u201cincreasingly vocal and hostile in his political views, alienating his family and friends,\u201d according to his attorneys. It was within the \u201cextreme and distorted conspiracy theories of QAnon and its angry call to action\u201d that Meredith \u201cfelt he had found the illusory sense of purpose and meaning that had eluded him,\u201d his attorneys wrote.Meredith was not serious about shooting Pelosi, his attorneys argued, noting that he\u2019d given himself the \u201cspy\u201d nickname \u201cDoubleODipshit\u201d and sent messages suggesting that he was joking.As HuffPost reported earlier this year, belief in the QAnon movement has driven families apart, with the friends and relatives of adherents of the bizarre conspiracy movement struggling to pull their loved ones back to reality. The FBI has made about 700 arrests in connection with the Jan. 6 attack, with hundreds more arrests in the works.Senior Justice Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Bush\u2019s White House ethics lawyer attacked a fundraising scheme appealing to MAGA supporters that cites Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 election lies.Attorney Richard Painter singled out attorney Sidney Powell, who raised at least $14 million for her Defending the Republic nonprofit group using baseless claims about election \u201cfraud,\u201d The Washington Post reported. Where that money landed is unknown. Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed the financial records of Defending the Republic and other Powell groups in a criminal probe, according to the Post.Prosecutors have also accused Powell of filing false incorporation papers for Defending the Republic in Texas, allegedly naming board members who were not actually on her board in order to attract donations, The Guardian reported this month.\u201cThere is no First Amendment right to lie to people to get their money,\u201d Painter wrote Sunday in an op-ed on the NBC News site.\u201cLet\u2019s be clear about something: Spreading fake news alone may be protected speech under the First Amendment. But spreading fake news to ask for money is commercial speech, and courts enforce laws criminalizing fraud,\u201d Painter continued.Powell and Defending the Republic were hit early this year with a $1.3 billion defamation suit by Dominion Voting Systems, accusing the attorney of spreading \u201cwild\u201d and \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d claims that Dominion played a key role in an imaginary scheme to steal the 2020 election from Trump.Powell and other attorneys were ordered by a federal judge this month to pay $175,000 in sanctions to Michigan officials they unsuccessfully sued in an effort to overturn the state\u2019s 2020 presidential election results. The judge referred to some of the claims as downright \u201cfantastical.\u201dTrump and hi Republican Party, Painter noted, raked in $255.4 million in the eight weeks after the presidential election, baselessly claiming a rigged vote.Painter also pointed to former White House strategist Steve Bannon\u2019s appeal to MAGA supporters to help build Trump\u2019s border wall. Bannon and associates were indicted for allegedly bilking \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of donors in an operation that raised some $25 million. Trump pardoned Bannon before he left the White House.Trends Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostIf an awards show announces its nominations, but no one is around to watch the ceremony, does it really even matter? That\u2019s the question facing the 2022 Golden Globes. The nominees for the 79th annual ceremony were unveiled early Monday amid a scandal-ridden period for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the group that hands out the annual coveted trophies celebrating the best in film and television. Despite NBC pulling the plug on this season\u2019s broadcast amid public outcry over the organization\u2019s lack of diversity and shady business dealings, the show will indeed go on, though it remains to be seen exactly what kind of event will take place when the winners are announced on Jan. 9. The association\u2019s recently elected president Helen Hoehne announced the nominations via livestream from the Beverly Hills Hilton in Los Angeles with the help of special guest Snoop Dogg. Multiple stars, including Gabrielle Union, reportedly turned down the gig.Leading the pack of this year\u2019s film nominees, with seven nods apiece, are Kenneth Branagh\u2019s black-and-white retelling of his childhood \u201cBelfast\u201d and \u201cThe Power of the Dog,\u201d Jane Campion\u2019s rapturous Western starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Kirsten Dunst, who are both up for acting trophies. On the television side, HBO\u2019s \u201cSuccession\u201d made a strong showing across the drama categories, with a total of five nominations, while Apple TV+\u2019s \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d and \u201cTed Lasso\u201d trail with four. The embattled group of foreign journalists has been under fire over its longstanding questionable financial practices, and its meager record on diversity and representation (the group previously counted zero Black members). The problematic inner workings of the association, including ethical conflicts and instances of self-dealing within its 87-member voting body, came to light in multiple damning reports published by The Los Angeles Times just days before last year\u2019s ceremony. The controversy resulted in a full-blown implosion for the awards show. A number of advisers jumped ship, more than 100 publicity firms representing major Hollywood talent demanded \u201cprofound and lasting change,\u201d and multiple studios, including Netflix, Amazon and Warner Bros., threatened to boycott. A variety of A-list celebrities also spoke out against the organization, with Tom Cruise going so far as to send back his three Golden Globe statuettes to the press association\u2019s headquarters.Over the past few months, the association has implemented reforms and overhauled bylaws to create what it claims to be a more equitable and inclusive organization. Representing the largest increase to its membership in history, 21 first-time Globes voters (among whom 29% identify as Black) have been added in an effort to expand and diversify the ranks. Members have been banned from receiving gifts that could curry favor with studios (a now-infamous press trip to the set of \u201cEmily In Paris\u201d partly sparked the initial backlash). Just last month, a new diversity officer was also appointed to lead a five-year partnership with the NAACP to address the group\u2019s diversity issues.But whether the changes will be swift or meaningful enough to attract Hollywood talent remains to be seen. Many studios and publicity firms refused to even enter film and television projects for Globes consideration this year, leading the organization to do away with its longheld submission requirement.\u201cI can say with confidence that it\u2019s not going to be the regular award show,\u201d the association\u2019s Hoehne told Vanity Fair about next month\u2019s ceremony. \u201cWe realize that this is not the tone this year, so we are taking a humble approach for 2022 \u2014 we\u2019re just honoring the people we think showed most excellence in 2021.\u201d The 79th annual Golden Globe Awards Jan. 9 ceremony is set for the same day as the broadcast for Critics Choice Awards, which some have suggested should replace the Golden Globes ceremony permanently.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostDr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that while he remained concerned about the threat of the omicron variant of COVID-19 and an ongoing surge in cases linked to the delta strain, the U.S. had all the tools needed to \u201cprotect ourselves\u201d including widespread access to booster vaccinations and social distancing measures.Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, made the comments on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d saying preliminary data appears to show the omicron strain has a high degree of transmissibility. It may be able to evade some immune protections that come from vaccination.\u201cThe somewhat encouraging news is that preliminary data showed that when you get a booster, for example, the third shot of an mRNA, it raises the level of protection high enough that it does then do well against the omicron,\u201d Fauci said Sunday. He added the initial data was yet \u201canother reason to encourage people who are not vaccinated to get vaccinated, but particularly those who are vaccinated to get boosted because that diminution in protection seems to go way back up again.\u201d\u201cFor now, if you want to be optimally protected, absolutely get a booster if you\u2019ve already had your primary vaccination,\u201d he added.\u201cThe somewhat encouraging news is that preliminary data show that when you get a booster\u2026it raises the level of protection high enough that it then does do well against the omicron,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci tells @GStephanopoulos as variant spreads. https://t.co/47KBWuFRS4 pic.twitter.com/FbMDgWjo0AAbout 100 million Americans are now eligible for a booster shot, and public health officials have urged people to come forward to get the jabs amid the threat of the omicron variant. Much is still unknown about the strain and the still highly transmissible delta variant remains the dominant one in the U.S. that\u2019s currently driving another wave of infections.Fauci said Sunday that it\u2019s too soon to tell if boosters will need to be a yearly occurrence and researchers will have to follow the durability of the vaccines over the coming months. But he said he was optimistic that those who get boosted will see longer-term benefits.\u201cI\u2019m hoping, from an immunological standpoint, that that third shot of an mRNA and the second shot of a J&J will give a much greater durability of protection than just the six months or so that we\u2019re seeing right now,\u201d the doctor said.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostReporter, HuffPostThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled Friday to allow federal court challenges against Texas\u2019 extreme and unusual abortion ban, but also decided to allow the law to remain in effect while those challenges are considered.Chief Justice John Roberts and the court\u2019s three liberal justices encouraged lower courts to act swiftly, writing, \u201cGiven the ongoing chilling effect of the state law, the District Court should resolve this litigation and enter appropriate relief without delay.\u201dThe case will now be sent back to a federal district court in Texas, which already decided to block enforcement of the law once. That move was reversed by an appellate court, and the law has been in effect since September. In a splintered 5-4 opinion, the court also decided that abortion providers may sue some state officials over the law, such as those with authority over medical licenses, but not others, such as judges, court clerks and attorneys general.Roberts and the three liberal justices dissented over who could be sued, arguing that court clerks and attorneys general are in fact proper defendants. \u201cIt is the role of the Supreme Court in our constitutional system that is at stake,\u201d Roberts wrote.Justice Sonia Sotomayor also criticized the majority\u2019s decision to allow the law to remain in effect for now, writing, \u201cThe Court should have put an end to this madness months ago.\u201d\u201cIt failed to do so then, and it fails again today,\u201d she wrote. The court\u2019s verdicts come one week after its members signaled willingness to overhaul the federal government\u2019s stance on abortion in a separate case centering on a Mississippi abortion ban. On Dec. 1, the court heard arguments in that case, which reproductive health advocates fear will result in effectively undoing Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that permitted abortion nationwide. Key votes on Friday\u2019s decisions were cast by conservative justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, who both previously voted to allow the law to go into effect but signaled some apprehension about the law\u2019s potential to set a wider precedent during a Nov. 1 hearing.At that hearing, abortion providers and the Justice Department aired their grievances with the Texas legislation, which effectively bans abortion at six weeks of pregnancy. At issue before the justices was the law\u2019s enforcement mechanism, which deputizes private citizens, not the state, to enforce it and offers a $10,000 bounty to anyone who successfully sues someone for \u201caiding or abetting\u201d patients violating the law. It makes no exceptions for rape or incest. That element of the law has successfully shielded the state from lawsuits over the ban and allowed it to remain in effect despite clear conflict with abortion protections established by Roe v. Wade.It\u2019s a \u201cloophole that\u2019s been exploited,\u201d Kavanaugh said at the Nov. 1 hearing, pointing to concerns that the same mechanism could be used to shield gun control measures from lawsuits.Barrett raised concerns that the law prevented abortion providers from exercising a \u201cfull constitutional defense.\u201dDuring the months the law has been in effect, Texas patients seeking abortions more than six weeks into term \u2015 a period when many women do not even know they\u2019re pregnant \u2015 have been forced to travel out of the state for care, often spending hundreds of dollars on transportation, accommodations and other travel costs to have the procedure. The law\u2019s success, however, has prompted other states to introduce copycat bills with similar enforcement language.This week, Alabama became the fourth state to consider similar abortion ban legislation, following Arkansas, Ohio and Florida.Senior Reporter, HuffPostReporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

It included Carlson describing women as \u201cextremely primitive\u201d and \u201clike dogs.\u201d He also said that it \u201cgets women going\u201d when men argue with them.\u201cIf you\u2019re talking to a feminist,\u201d he said in 2006, \u201cand she\u2019s given you, \u2018Well, men really need to be more sensitive,\u2019 no, actually, men don\u2019t need to be more sensitive.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Rev. Craig Duke has been a Methodist minister for three decades, building a reputation as a staunch advocate of LGBTQ inclusion. His pastoral duties have now been terminated \u2014 the result of a bitter rift surfacing in his Indiana church after he sought to demonstrate solidarity by appearing in drag alongside prominent drag queens in the HBO reality series \u201cWe\u2019re Here.\u201dDuke, 62, said he thought most of his 400-member congregation at Newburgh United Methodist Church shared his inclusive views, and he was taken aback when a prominent congregation member, soon backed by other churchgoers, circulated emails attacking him.\u201cYou have thrown NUMC under the bus to elevate a minority of individuals,\u201d said one of the emails. Another, according to Duke, said Satan must be pleased with the discord over LGBTQ rights.Duke, who declined to identify his chief critics, told The Associated Press that the attacks \u201cfelt very personal,\u201d causing him to worry about his mental health.\u201cIt was a matter of sadness and disappointment and heartbreak on my part ... realizing I was losing the ability to lead,\u201d he said.Under United Methodist Church protocol, a pastor does not have the option of resigning, but Duke said he made clear to his immediate superior, regional superintendent Mitch Gieselman, that he needed to step away.On Nov. 26, Gieselman \u2014 who had been hearing from the pastor\u2019s critics and supporters \u2014 sent a letter to the NUMC congregation announcing that Duke \u201cis being relieved of his pastoral duties.\u201dThrough the next three months, Duke said he and his wife will be allowed to continue living in the NUMC parsonage, while he incurs a 40% pay cut. They must relocate no later than Feb. 28, when his pay will be halted, Gieselman said.While Gieselman noted in his letter than Duke\u2019s actions had \u201cpolarized\u201d the congregation, he said none of those actions constituted formal violations of UMC\u2019s Book of Discipline, which functions as a legal code for Methodist clergy.\u201cI was bullied out,\u201d Duke said.The episode of \u201cWe\u2019re Here\u201d featuring Duke \u2014 at one point shown in a dress, high-heeled boots, a pink wig and heavy make-up \u2014 was taped in July but did not air until Nov. 8.Duke was invited to participate in the show by an LGBTQ Pride group in nearby Evansville and accepted in part to show support for his 23-year-old daughter, Tiffany, who identifies as pansexual.The premise of \u201cWe\u2019re Here,\u201d an Emmy-nominated series now in its second season, is that three renowned drag performers travel to towns and small cities across the U.S., recruiting a few locals to join them as drag queens.Even before the episode was broadcast, some congregation members complained that Duke hadn\u2019t given them advance notice of his decision to be in the show, which included scenes filmed at the church. In response, Duke wrote to the congregation in August, saying he was sorry that trust in his leadership had been damaged.But he defended his motives, saying, \u201cI was willing and excited to share God\u2019s love with the LGBTQ community on a national level.\u201dAny hope that conflict would subside vanished in mid-November when the emails attacking him began to circulate.The rift within Duke\u2019s congregation reflects broader divisions within the United Methodist Church, the largest mainline Protestant denomination in the United States.Conservative leaders in the UMC have unveiled plans to form a new denomination, the Global Methodist Church, with a doctrine that does not recognize same-sex marriage. The move could hasten the long-expected breakup of the UMC over differing approaches to LGBTQ inclusion, including whether LGBTQ people should be ordained as clergy.Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the UMC\u2019s General Conference \u2014 at which the schism would be debated \u2014 has been postponed for two consecutive years and is now scheduled for August 2022 in Minneapolis.According to Duke, one of the reasons he was invited to appear on \u201cWe\u2019re Here\u201d was because of the divisions in both his own church and the UMC.\u201cMy only hope and goal was and is to bring the message of God\u2019s unconditional love to a community that has been greatly marginalized,\u201d Duke wrote to his congregation.The decision to terminate Duke\u2019s duties already has had ripple effects. His wife, Linda, who was pastor of youth ministry, resigned. So did church administrative assistant Erin Sexton, who along with her husband, Chris, organized a GoFundMe campaign to help the Dukes.As of Wednesday morning, more than $52,000 had been pledged by more than 900 people, scores of whom added comments thanking Duke for his LGBTQ advocacy.Chris Sexton said he had been a member of Newburgh United Methodist since childhood and described Duke as \u201cone of the most captivating and genuine\u201d of the many pastors who served over the years. But the Sextons said many congregants shied away from the conflict over \u201cWe\u2019re Here,\u201d allowing Duke\u2019s critics to dominate the debate.Duke is unsure what his next step will be, though he doesn\u2019t plan to return to pastoring. One possibility, he said, would be for him and his wife to establish \u201can inclusive camp\u201d for youths and young adults.\u201cMy heart is moving in a new direction,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are so many people who have been hurt by religion, felt rejection, who are reaching out, who are hopeful this will spark me to do something different on their behalf.\u201dBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Gender Reporter, HuffPostArkansas became the latest state to consider a copycat version of Texas\u2019 draconian six-week abortion ban on Tuesday, when state Sen. Jason Rapert (R) filed Senate Bill 13 during a special legislative session. Rapert\u2019s bill went a step further than the Lone Star State\u2019s S.B. 8: The proposed Arkansas legislation aims to ban abortion at any stage of pregnancy. The special legislative session was largely dedicated to discussing tax cuts, but Rapert, a vocal anti-abortion advocate, said in October that he was planning to introduce legislation similar to Texas\u2019 during the short legislative window. \u201cWhat Texas has done is absolutely awesome,\u201d Rapert told news outlets in September after Texas passed its six-week ban. Similar to Texas\u2019 ban, S.B. 13 would deputize private citizens to enforce the law by offering a $10,000 bounty to anyone who successfully sues someone aiding or abetting a person seeking an abortion. The legislation prohibits abortion from \u201cfertilization until live birth\u201d and only allows exceptions if the life of the pregnant person is at risk. It\u2019s a modification of the Arkansas Human Heartbeat Protection Act, which was passed into law in 2013 and included a ban on abortion at 12 weeks \u2015 the most restrictive abortion law in the country at the time \u2015 before it was overturned by the Supreme Court. \u201cAbortion is a crime against humanity,\u201d Rapert told HuffPost. \u201cWe believe it is urgent that we use the Texas-style civil cause of action approach to ensure abortions are stopped right now. It is time the will of individual states to protect human life is respected across the nation.\u201dFellow anti-abortion state Rep. Mary Bentley (R) is the other primary sponsor of the bill. Nearly 30 other Republicans co-sponsored the act, reaching the two-thirds threshold necessary for the bill to be considered in the special session. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R), a staunch anti-abortion lawmaker, said ahead of the special session that any further abortion restrictions should wait until a decision is handed down in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization Supreme Court case, which the high court heard last week and centers on a 15-week abortion ban in Mississippi.But Rapert disagreed with Hutchinson, telling a local NPR affiliate that waiting on a Supreme Court decision would mean that abortions would continue in the state. Rapert added an emergency clause in the bill\u2019s text alleging that because of Texas\u2019 abortion ban people from the state are traveling to Arkansas to receive care. The influx of Texans \u201cis burdening the healthcare system\u201d in Arkansas, the bill claims, causing an increase in abortions in the state. \u201cThis act is immediately necessary to protect the lives of unborn children and the health and safety of pregnant women in this state,\u201d the bill states. The special legislative session was later shut down without being formally opened, meaning the copycat bill is not currently moving through the Arkansas state legislature, but likely will be once it\u2019s back in session in February.Florida and Ohio have also introduced copycat Texas laws since September. Reproductive justice advocates in Florida told HuffPost in November that they\u2019re confident the copycat bill will not gain traction. Ohio is a different story. Similar to Arkansas, the Ohio bill aims to ban abortion at any point in pregnancy and includes the clause that deputizes private citizens. Just over a month ago, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the controversial Texas law, specifically debating the enforcement mechanism of financially incentivizing private citizens to act as bounty hunters. Although many of the Supreme Court justices seemed open to allowing legal challenges to Texas\u2019 abortion ban, a decision has yet to be handed down. About two-thirds of Americans say the Texas law should be struck down by the Supreme Court, according to a recent poll.Although it\u2019s only been in place for a little over three months, Texas\u2019 extreme abortion restriction has had deeply detrimental effects on people seeking abortions in the Southern state. Many are leaving the state to get abortions while other less privileged people are being forced to give birth. Abortion clinics in bordering states like Oklahoma and New Mexico are overwhelmed with Texas patients, leaving clinic staff extremely overworked as they try to accommodate the influx of new patients.The same will likely happen in Arkansas if Rapert\u2019s copycat bill successfully makes its way through the state legislature. \u201cThe overwhelming majority of Arkansans would lose access to care,\u201d Emily Wales, the CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, told HuffPost in October. \u201cThe reality of what this means for the region is very, very real and present. It would only increase that crisis to Arkansans who would then be forced to travel, if they can afford to, to states even farther out \u2015 potentially overwhelming the neighboring states that are trying to support Texans.\u201dArkansas is already one of the most anti-abortion states in the country. The state passed 20 abortion restrictions in the most recent legislative session alone. Just this year, Rapert helped to pass a near-total abortion ban in Arkansas that was eventually blocked by a federal judge. The state also passed a trigger law in 2019 that will immediately ban abortion if Roe v. Wade is overturned. Currently, there are only two abortion clinics in the entire state of Arkansas, and 77% of women in the state live in counties with no abortion clinic.This article has been updated to include context around the special legislative session being shut down without a formal introduction.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Trends Reporter, HuffPostA former District of Columbia National Guard official has blasted Lt. Gen. Charles Flynn \u2014 brother of disgraced onetime national security adviser Michael Flynn \u2014 and Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt as \u201cabsolute and unmitigated liars\u201d in their account of the Pentagon\u2019s response to the Jan. 6 insurrection, according to a memo obtained by Politico.In a 36-page memo to the House select committee investigating the insurrection, Col. Earl Matthews accuses Charles Flynn and Piatt of lying to Congress about what transpired behind the scenes the day rioters breached the Capitol. According to Matthews, the two men have played a key role in the Pentagon\u2019s attempt to shirk responsibility for a dangerously sluggish, hours-late response to the violence.Matthews writes that Flynn, who was Army deputy chief of staff for operations on Jan. 6, and Piatt, the director of Army staff, are attempting to \u201cabsolve Senior Army Leaders of any responsibility in the delays\u201d in responding to the attack on the Capitol.On Jan. 6, Matthews, who held top-level National Security Council and Pentagon positions in the Trump administration, was the top attorney to Maj. Gen. William Walker, then the commanding general of the D.C. National Guard.\u201cEvery leader in the D.C. Guard wanted to respond and knew they could respond to the riot at the seat of government before they were given clearance to do so on Jan. 6,\u201d Matthews states in his memo. Instead, he recounts, D.C. Guard officials sat \u201cstunned watching [events unfold on TV] in the Armory when for the first time in its 219 year history, the D.C. National Guard was not allowed to respond to a riot in the city.\u201dThe Pentagon claims it was the D.C. Guard that was slow to react to the violence and had to be told twice to respond, which then-commander Walker has vehemently denied.Initially, the Army repeatedly denied that Charles Flynn had anything to do with the military response to the insurrection. But he personally confirmed that he had participated in a tense Jan. 6 phone call about what actions to take as rioters breached the Capitol, The Washington Post reported. Walker has told investors that he was \u201cstunned\u201d and \u201cfrustrated\u201d during the conference call in which he says D.C. officials asked for National Guard assistance and Flynn and Piatt advised against providing it. Matthews confirmed Walker\u2019s account of the call in his memo.In his memo, Matthews also attacked the report that the Pentagon inspector general issued last month on Army leadership\u2019s response to the Capitol riot. Matthews called it \u201creplete with factual inaccuracies that served to create a revisionist history \u201cworthy of the best Stalinist or North Korea propagandist.\u201dWalker had earlier called for the inspector general to retract his report for what he described as \u201csloppy work\u201d and \u201cinaccurate\u201d findings. Walker told Politico that Matthews\u2019 memo \u201cspeaks for itself\u201d and said he had nothing to add.\u201cOur Army has never failed us and did not do so on Jan. 6,\u201d Matthews told Politico. \u201cHowever, occasionally some of our Army leaders have failed us and they did so on January 6th. Then they lied about it and tried to cover it up.\u201dSeveral other key figures in the events of that day have recounted their experiences with the Pentagon\u2019s puzzlingly slow response as rioters marauded through the Capitol, and lawmakers, afraid for their safety and lives, hid beneath benches and in barricaded offices.Maryland\u2019s Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, for example, said he quickly offered the services of his state\u2019s National Guard but wasn\u2019t granted permission to send them for hours.Charles Flynn\u2019s brother, Michael Flynn, is a retired Army lieutenant general, right-wing extremist and staunch Trump ally. Just weeks before the insurrection, he retweeted a message calling on a defeated President Donald Trump to declare martial law and keep the White House by force. Five months later, he called for a Myanmar-style military coup in the U.S.Army spokesperson Mike Brady told Politico in a statement that Charles Flynn and Piatt have been \u201copen, honest and thorough in their sworn testimony with Congress and Department of Defense investigators.\u201dCiting the Pentagon inspector general report that Matthews and Walker have criticized, Brady said that the inspector general had determined that actions taken were \u201cappropriate, supported by requirements ... and compliant with laws, regulations, and other applicable guidance.\u201d Read Politico\u2019s full story here, and Matthews\u2019 memo here.Trends Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostSenior Reporter, HuffPostSenior National Correspondent, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2015 Republicans are going to war over one of the most popular proposals Democrats are seeking to enshrine into law: a new federal program that could help millions of families get affordable child care for the first time.On Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) devoted a large majority of his floor speech to attacking the proposed child care plan as exceedingly complicated, maintaining that Democrats\u2019 \u201ctoddler takeover\u201d would make Americans\u2019 hellish child care situation even worse. \u201cIf you like your child care, you can keep your child care!\u201d McConnell mocked, arguing there would be implementation headaches like those associated with the Affordable Care Act. \u201cBuckle up, parents. What could go wrong?\u201dDemocrats have a simple pitch for their child care proposal: No family will pay more than 7% of its income on child care, thanks to new federal subsidies. Along with \u201cuniversal\u201d prekindergarten and monthly cash payments for parents, the child care proposal is a pillar of the benefits for working families in the Build Back Better legislation, which Democrats are hoping to pass by the end of the year. But the actual plan is a lot more complex than the pitch. Subsidies would vary based on household income, and eligibility for them would rise over a three-year transition period, cutting off at 100% of state median income in year one and then reaching 250% after year three.Child care providers would have to meet state licensing requirements and states would have three years to set up a tiered system for evaluating provider quality. Providers would have to pay their workers living wages, using a pay scale that would make sure workers in child care make roughly the same as workers with similar credentials in their local public school systems.In attacking the Democratic proposal, McConnell cited a progressive critic that argued the program would expose some families to higher, even prohibitive costs, especially during the three-year transition period, because the quality and wage requirements would push up child care prices even for families who were not eligible for assistance.The program\u2019s advocates, both in and out of Congress, have strongly disputed that claim. And regardless of whether the claim is true, the new Democratic initiative could transform the lives of millions of Americans, with thousands of dollars in savings on average for low-income and middle-class families.Exactly how many would benefit is difficult to say, because the whole program would depend on state participation, with many states almost sure to say no. And the appropriation would run out after six years, which means the funding \u2015 and the subsidies \u2015 would vanish if lawmakers don\u2019t pass legislation to extend it in the future.Still, the roughly $400 billion in new federal spending would represent the largest investment in the early childhood years in American history. And it would dwarf narrower proposals from congressional Republicans, such as expanded tax credits and flexible spending accounts, that would ultimately provide much less assistance. \u201cObviously, Sen. McConnell does not have small children and he has not looked for child care so he could make it to the office every day,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a top child care funding advocate, told HuffPost.\u201cI think Sen. McConnell is feeling the heat,\u201d she added.Democrats are betting that it will be difficult for Republicans to oppose popular elements of Build Back Better, such as child care and universal pre-K. They\u2019re counting on passage of the bill, which is no sure thing yet, to lift the party\u2019s standing ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.According to a recent Hart Research poll, nearly 70% of voters, including a majority of Republicans, want Congress to prioritize providing affordable child care this year.\u201cIt\u2019s deeply surprising that Republicans would go after something so popular like child care,\u201d Zac Petkanas, a Democratic strategist, told HuffPost. \u201cOne of the key things in the Build Back Better legislation is the cost-cutting components of the bill, and the child care pieces are a key part of that. They\u2019re really playing with fire when they go after child care.\u201d McConnell also said the Democratic plan would put child care providers affiliated with religion at a disadvantage, by requiring that providers in the program abide by nondiscrimination rules and prohibiting the use of government funds for facilities that are used for sectarian purposes.\u201cWashington Democrats want to unleash the woke mob on church day care,\u201d McConnell said.The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America have indeed raised concerns that the legislation\u2019s language would make it difficult, if not impossible, for some religious providers to participate in the programBut Democratic staff and their allies have insisted the groups are misreading the legislation, which states plainly that \u201cNothing in this section shall preclude the use of [subsidies] for sectarian child care services if freely chosen by the parent.\u201d They note that a primary goal of the Democratic plan is to work with existing child care providers, many of which are religious institutions and already comply with anti-discrimination rules tied to other government funding programs.The longer the debate over Build Back Better goes on, the more chances Republicans will have to turn public opinion against the legislation. Already, there are doubts that Democrats will be able to send the bill to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk by the end of the month as they had set out to do. If they are unable to do so, the process could drag even further into next year and could prevent Democrats from promoting the new measures to voters as a path to retaining their narrow congressional majorities.\u201cI know they think this polls well, but the more people find out what\u2019s in the bill, the less popular it is,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) told HuffPost.

Voting rights advocate and Democratic superstar Stacey Abrams said Wednesday she would run again for governor after a close race in 2018 in which she lost to Kemp by less than 1.4 percentage points. Abrams has spent the intervening years driving voter registration efforts and was hailed by Democratic leaders for helping elect Ossoff and Sen. Raphael Warnock (D) in 2020.The New York Times reported that Abrams\u2019 announcement hastened Perdue\u2019s own and solidified his desire to enter the race.

Dole. #RememberingBobDole pic.twitter.com/s9aTf8LOztDole had announced in February that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and would be undergoing immediate treatment. A cause of death was not immediately released.Dole was a prominent statesman, decorated war veteran and, until Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) surpassed him in June 2018, the Senate\u2019s longest-serving Republican leader. Dole challenged incumbent Bill Clinton for the presidency in 1996, when he was the senior senator from Kansas. Before that, Dole served, at various times, as Senate majority leader, Senate minority leader, chairman of the Republican National Committee, and a member of the House of Representatives. He ran unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination in 1980 and 1988, and was President Gerald Ford\u2019s running mate in 1976.President Joe Biden, who served with Dole in the Senate for more than two decades, remembered the late senator on Sunday as a friend and \u201can American statesman like few in our history.\u201d Biden said that even with their political differences, he could always look to Dole for \u201ctrusted guidance, or a humorous line\u201d and that Dole \u201cnever hesitated to work with me or other Democrats when it mattered most.\u201d\u201cBob was a man to be admired by Americans. He had an unerring sense of integrity and honor. May God bless him, and may our nation draw upon his legacy of decency, dignity, good humor, and patriotism for all time,\u201d Biden said in a statement. The White House later ordered that all flags be flown at half-staff on public buildings, grounds, military posts and naval stations until sunset on Thursday in Dole\u2019s honor.Dole was born on July 22, 1923, in Russell, Kansas, and grew up in a working-class household that struggled financially. One year, to make ends meet during the Great Depression, his family rented out his home\u2019s first floor and lived in the basement.In school, he succeeded in both sports and academics, and attended the University of Kansas. Following the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, he left his studies to serve as a combat infantry officer in the Army. In northern Italy, he sustained serious injuries from German machine-gun fire near Castel d\u2019Aiano, which left him with permanent limited mobility in his right arm. He received two Purple Hearts for his injuries and the Bronze Star for valor.In 1950, after recovering from his injuries and obtaining undergraduate and law degrees from Washburn University, Dole ran for the Kansas state House of Representatives. He served a two-year term, then became a county attorney. Dole successfully ran for the U.S. House in 1960 and then the Senate in 1969.He spent more than 11 years as Senate majority leader, the longest-serving Republican in the post until McConnell\u2019s tenure passed his. In Congress, Dole managed to appeal to both political moderates and conservatives. He pleased the former by partnering with then-Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.) to lower eligibility requirements for food stamps. He also supported civil rights legislation and federal aid for the disabled. Conservatives, meanwhile, appreciated his hawkish positions on foreign policy and crime, as well as his votes against public housing subsidies and Medicare.In 1989, President Ronald Reagan presented him with the Presidential Citizens Medal for his work as a public servant. In the ceremony, Reagan celebrated him as \u201ca friend to veterans, farmers and Americans from every walk of life.\u201dWhen he secured the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 at the age of 73, Dole became the oldest first-time presidential nominee in U.S. history. Political observers have hypothesized that Dole was hurt by the Democratic strategy of tying him to the unpopular speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), whom many blamed for the back-to-back government shutdowns in late 1995.In 1997, Clinton honored Dole, his former rival, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\u201cSon of the soil, citizen, soldier and legislator, Bob Dole understands the American people, their struggles, their triumphs and their dreams,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cOur country is better for his courage, his determination and his willingness to go the long course to lead America.\u201dAfter leaving Congress, Dole worked at a law firm and appeared in commercials for Viagra, Visa, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts and Pepsi. He founded the Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas for the study of civic participation and bipartisan solutions to national problems. He also worked to raise awareness and funds for world hunger, veterans and disability issues during his post-congressional career, though he watched one of those causes suffer a defeat at the hands of his fellow Republicans when the Senate failed to ratify the United Nations\u2019 Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2012.In 2014, Dole completed a tour of all of Kansas\u2019 105 counties and campaigned on behalf of Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.).In January of 2018, he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in recognition of his service to the nation as a soldier, legislator and statesman. McConnell praised him during the ceremony as \u201cthe true measure of servant leadership.\u201d\u201cBob has built an extraordinary life on the basis of ordinary American values,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAs a legislator, he showed that principles and pragmatism are not opposites but complements. As a leader, he prized results over rhetoric. And above all \u2015 from Castel d\u2019Aiano to Percy Jones Army Hospital to his favorite Senate balcony, facing the Mall \u2015 this soldier, statesman and American hero has never stopped fighting for vulnerable people who have less power and less strength than he does.\u201dIn a Washington Post opinion piece in 2012, Dole reflected on his life and described how he had been able to continue working on behalf of others long after leaving electoral politics.\u201cSure, losing an election hurts, but I\u2019ve experienced worse,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd at an age when every day is precious, brooding over what might have been is self-defeating.\u201dIn recent years, Dole had expressed dissatisfaction with the direction of the Republican Party, saying in 2013 that the GOP should be \u201cclosed for repairs\u201d and that it needed to learn how to cooperate with Democrats. His record as a moderate earned criticism from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who in March 2014 cited Dole as an example of a Republican presidential candidate who lost because he didn\u2019t stand for GOP principles.In the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Dole was a supporter of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose late father, George H.W. Bush, was his onetime political rival. Dole eventually got behind Donald Trump after his second GOP candidate of choice, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, also dropped out of the race. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to hope he\u2019ll be a good president,\u201d he told ABC News in 2016 of then-candidate Trump. \u201cTrump has to start acting like a presidential candidate and tone down the rhetoric and don\u2019t insult anybody.\u201dDole continued to voice support for Trump even after Trump\u2019s 2020 loss to Biden in the presidential election, which Dole said he believes Biden won fairly, though perhaps narrowly.\u201cHe lost the election, and I regret that he did, but they did,\u201d he told USA Today in July. \u201cI\u2019m a Trumper,\u201d he was quoted as saying, adding at another point: \u201cI\u2019m sort of Trumped out, though.\u201dDole called Biden \u201ca great, kind, upstanding, decent person.\u201d He said Biden visited him with his grandchildren in February following news of his cancer diagnosis.Dole is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Dole, a former North Carolina senator and secretary of labor and transportation, and his daughter, Robin Dole.Staff Reporter, The Huffington Post Breaking News Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostLabor Reporter, HuffPostSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2015 A faction of congressional Republicans threatened to shut down the government this week over what they call President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cvaccine mandate.\u201dThe rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration would not require employers to take action against unvaccinated workers so long as they\u2019re willing to be tested weekly for COVID-19 \u2015 but Republicans have ignored that part of the regulation.\u201cWhen you\u2019re unwilling to describe something accurately, it betrays a weakness in your position,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said on the Senate floor Thursday evening. \u201cIt\u2019s not a vaccine mandate. It is a vaccine-or-testing mandate.\u201dIndeed, the OSHA rule, which is tied up in court and hasn\u2019t taken effect, does not require people to get shots. It requires large employers to implement programs in which workers who work indoors either get vaccinated or wear a mask and undergo weekly testing for COVID-19. Employers, if they choose, can mandate that their workers get the jab (as many employers already do). But OSHA\u2019s rule allows every employer the leeway to test.Kaine is not the only supporter of the rule annoyed by Republicans\u2019 lack of nuance. David Michaels, who ran OSHA under former President Barack Obama, said that employers don\u2019t have to force a vaccine on anyone \u2014 they just have to keep infected workers out of the workplace.\u201cMisrepresenting OSHA\u2019s rule is a cynical tactic by Republican politicians and anti-vaxxers who seem to want to prolong the pandemic and the misery it has brought, in order to hurt the Biden Administration,\u201d Michaels said in an email.Testing is an option under the rule, but it would probably be an annoying one \u2014 and that may be the idea. In its preamble to the rule\u2019s text, OSHA calls vaccination \u201cthe most effective and efficient control available\u201d to prevent transmission of the virus. The logistical and financial hurdles to weekly tests make vaccination more attractive.OSHA\u2019s rule would not force employers to foot the bill for testing, raising questions about how the cost would be covered.Federal law requires insurers to cover the cost of COVID-19 tests, but not for tests done as part of workplace screening. The Biden administration announced Thursday that insurers will have to reimburse the cost of over-the-counter tests. Such tests are acceptable under the OSHA rule if they are Food and Drug Administration-approved, but it\u2019s not clear if insurers will have to reimburse for tests done for the sake of OSHA compliance. Even if they are covered, having to haggle with one\u2019s insurance company would be a headache.Another headache: \u201cHome\u201d tests not done under the supervision of a manager would have to be observed by a \u201ctelehealth proctor.\u201dDr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, said the Biden administration should clarify if regular over-the-counter tests for work must be reimbursed. But she also said there is a good public health reason for the weekly testing regime to be somewhat obnoxious.\u201cIn general, we need to make vaccination an easy and convenient choice, so having employees be required to mask and test is the right thing to do for public health reasons,\u201d Wen said in an interview. \u201cIt adds an additional incentive for vaccination.\u201dRepublicans have omitted the testing option from their descriptions of the mandate, but they shrugged it off when asked about it.Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kansas), the ringleader of the Senate Republicans attacking the mandate, said he thought firms with more than 100 employees \u2015 the threshold for being subject to the requirement \u2015 could not possibly handle testing their workforce every week.\u201cI\u2019ve talked to hundreds of business owners back home, and they think it\u2019s almost impossible to do that,\u201d Marshall told HuffPost. \u201cIt is a huge inconvenience.\u201dMarshall added, \u201cFrankly, some of those people don\u2019t want to be tested, either.\u201dOther Republicans also brushed off the testing option. \u201cThe government\u2019s role is to just give us good information and let us make our own decision,\u201d Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) said.\u201cTesting is expensive and it\u2019s a burden,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) added.Some Republicans seemed unfamiliar with the testing alternative. \u201cI hadn\u2019t even heard of it,\u201d Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) said, noting that he\u2019d been spending \u201cevery waking minute\u201d on a national defense authorization bill. Inhofe was one of the Republicans who signed a letter calling the vaccine requirement \u201cimmoral.\u201d\u201cMy understanding is that there\u2019s not necessarily an opt-out, but even so, I mean, nobody should have to go through like a daily, weekly, whatever testing protocol,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) said.(Vaccine rules for federal workers and members of the armed forces don\u2019t have the same testing options.)State Republican officials have sued to stop the OSHA rule from moving forward, and a federal court granted a temporary stay blocking it on the grounds it raises \u201cgrave\u201d constitutional issues. The case will go before a panel of judges at the conservative-leaning U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, then possibly the Supreme Court. Even if the administration is successful, the litigation could push implementation of the vaccine-or-test deadline well beyond Jan. 4.It\u2019s hard to say how most employers will respond to the testing piece of the rule, assuming the regulation survives. Some may be happy to implement a vaccine requirement as many large employers already have, using the OSHA rule as cover. Others may want to maintain the testing opt-out to prevent any vaccine resisters from leaving, so long as they find the testing workable.Jordan Barab, a work safety expert and former OSHA official, said he believes the testing option would be a viable one, assuming the price of tests comes down. From a public-health perspective, Barab would prefer that the OSHA rule did not have a testing hatch door at all. But if the opt-out is there, he argues that employers should have to bear the cost of testing, so that more of them choose to forgo it.\u201cIf OSHA ultimately would like employers to mandate vaccinations, then they should have made it uncomfortable for employers\u201d to opt out, Barab said.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified the state Sen.

Kathy Hochul urged residents not to be alarmed, saying health officials expected the variant to appear in the state and that the cases announced should only serve as a reminder to Americans to get vaccinated and continue social-distancing measures.\u201cThis is not a cause for major alarm,\u201d Hochul said at a news conference alongside New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. \u201cWe are in a far better place,\u201d she added, noting: \u201cThe best thing everyone can do is to realize we are not defenseless against this variant at all, that vaccines, we know, are going to ensure there is less severe symptoms.\u201dThe best things you can do to protect yourself against omicron and any other variant: Get your vaccine.Get your booster.Get tested.Wear your mask.The state joins Minnesota, Hawaii and Colorado, which have all announced positive cases of the omicron strain after California said Wednesday it had detected the first known strain in the U.S. in a traveler who had recently returned from South Africa. The latest cases bring the total number of known omicron infections in the U.S. to 10.The omicron variant was first seen in South Africa and Botswana and has prompted concern among researchers who point to its large number of mutations, which could affect its transmissibility or allow it to bypass currently available vaccines. Researchers are still racing to learn more about the omicron variant, however, and much remains unknown about its capabilities. Officials have warned that the threat of the delta variant, which is highly transmissible, remains, pointing to figures that still show high levels of transmission in many places around the nation.Biden on Thursday announced a raft of new measures meant to stop the spread of the virus. On Thursday, the president said private health insurers will soon be required to reimburse patients for at-home COVID-19 tests, and he emphasized a strategy to see that all Americans get booster shots of a coronavirus vaccine. The White House also said it would expand family vaccination sites and tighten requirements for international travelers.\u201cWe\u2019re going to fight this variant with science and speed, not chaos and confusion,\u201d Biden said Thursday. \u201cThis is a moment we can put the divisiveness behind us, I hope.Senior Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Government funding runs out at midnight on Friday.If this short-term spending measure were passed by the Senate and signed by Biden, it would keep government funding at current levels \u2014 with an additional $7 billion for Afghan refugees \u2014 until Congress negotiates longer-term appropriations bills. The deal is a major step forward in avoiding a government shutdown, but tensions are still mounting the Senate. Some conservative Republicans are protesting an Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule requiring employees of large firms to get vaccinated against or be tested weekly for COVID-19. The rule is supposed to take effect in January, but Republican officials have challenged it in court. There aren\u2019t enough senators who oppose funding the government to actually tank the spending bill, but it would only take one Republican to delay the vote. Any objections to a quick vote on a funding bill would likely result in a partial government shutdown this weekend.\u201cAnti-science Republicans are demanding a choice between a return to the unchecked spread of Covid we had under the previous Administration and the bungled, self-destructive governance that led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history,\u201d Rep.

The letter specifically stated that the lawmakers would object to the kind of short-term funding bill that Republican and Democratic leaders have now agreed to.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) gave assurances this week that there shouldn\u2019t be any concerns about a government shutdown.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostThe House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack unanimously voted Wednesday evening in favor of holding Jeffrey Clark, a former Department of Justice official, criminally accountable for his failure to cooperate with the panel.The matter will now go to the full House for a vote and, if approved, it will be referred to the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, who can choose to pursue criminal charges based on Congress\u2019 recommendation.Clark, who ran the Justice Department\u2019s civil division, championed President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election; Trump even signaled interest in installing Clark as attorney general to further the cause.He is the second Trump ally to be held in contempt by the Jan. 6 panel, following onetime Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who surrendered to federal authorities in mid-November and was released without bail. Bannon\u2019s communications with the White House around the time of the Capitol riot put him in the committee\u2019s crosshairs, but he entirely refused to cooperate.Trump ordered several former associates, including Bannon, to ignore the select committee in October.While Clark did show up for his deposition in early November, he left with his attorney after around 90 minutes, refusing to answer questions based on Trump\u2019s claims to executive privilege.The committee\u2019s chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), said on Wednesday that Clark intends to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at a separate deposition on Saturday.The former president has latched onto executive privilege, which is the vaguely defined legal concept that sitting presidents have the right to keep certain communications and records secret. His attorneys are attempting to use this tool to shield Trump from legal repercussions stemming from the Capitol attack, and both Clark and Bannon have cited it in their bids to avoid complying with the Jan. 6 committee.Legal experts, however, doubt Trump\u2019s claim will stand up to legal scrutiny. Earlier this week, judges with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit did not appear to buy his argument that the court should bar the Jan. 6 House committee from getting its hands on a trove of his presidential records from the National Archives.Thompson and the committee\u2019s co-chair, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), have repeatedly pledged to use everything in their power to ensure the panel meets its goal: to determine exactly how the Capitol attack unfolded as it did, in order to make policy recommendations to prevent a future attempted insurrection.The Jan. 6 committee has issued dozens of subpoenas to date, targeting former White House officials, conservative organizers and extremist groups.One close Trump ally under subpoena \u2015 Mark Meadows, former White House chief of staff \u2015 appears close to submitting to a deposition after spending weeks \u201cengaging\u201d with the committee through his attorney, Thompson said Tuesday.\u201cThe Select Committee expects all witnesses, including Mr. Meadows, to provide all information requested and that the Select Committee is lawfully entitled to receive,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThe committee will continue to assess his degree of compliance with our subpoena after the deposition.\u201dReporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

We\u2019re hoping he\u2019s not going to shut down the economy,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cWhen a third of people are refusing to get the vaccines, this federal vaccination mandate would cause the economy to be shut down.\u201dThe so-called \u201cvaccine mandate\u201d \u2014 an Occupational Safety and Health Administration rule requiring employees of large firms to get vaccinated against or be tested weekly for COVID-19 \u2014 was supposed to take effect in January, but has been challenged in court by Republican officials. Because people can opt for testing instead of getting a shot, the rule is not really much of a mandate. Still, Marshall and more than a dozen of his colleagues threatened the shutdown strategy in a letter to Schumer last month, writing \u201cwe will oppose all efforts to implement and enforce [the vaccine rule] with every tool at our disposal, including our votes on spending measures considered by the Senate.\u201d The letter specifically threatened that the signatories would object to the kind of stopgap funding bill known as a \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d that Democrats had planned to pass this week.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that \u201cnobody should be concerned about a government shutdown.\u201d And if a shutdown does occur, it would likely be brief, since most Republicans did not join Marshall in his pledge to oppose a government funding bill over the vaccine rule. It would probably take the Senate a few days to overcome the filibuster with a cloture motion.  One problem is that the House still has to pass a bill funding the government, which hasn\u2019t happened yet because House leaders are still haggling with McConnell over the duration of funding. The Senate can\u2019t act until the House does, creating another potential delay. Shutting down the government \u2014 at a moment when Republicans have lots of political momentum and are poised to retake at least one chamber of Congress \u2014 is a highly questionable strategy, especially considering voters generally know which party has refused to cooperate with basic governance in past shutdowns. It could also hamper the government\u2019s efforts to contain the coronavirus following news of a new variant spreading around the world.Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) told HuffPost he didn\u2019t love the shutdown strategy. \u201cI object to the mandate,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I also think that in the times that we\u2019re in right now, funding the government, making sure we pay our bills, are pretty important.\u201d Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) suggested an alternate way for Republicans to sound off against the Biden administration\u2019s coronavirus policies without holding up government funding: a vote on a Congressional Review Act resolution seeking to disapprove of the rule, which all 50 Republicans already signed onto last month. In order to succeed, the resolution must be passed by the Senate and the House, both of which Democrats control, and be signed into law by the president.\u201cThere\u2019s a number of options that can be negotiated that would allow the point to be made but not in a way that would stop the [continuing resolution],\u201d Cornyn told HuffPost. House Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.), meanwhile, called the threat nonsensical. \u201cWe just listened to a report this morning from a well-noted virologist who\u2019s pointing out the seriousness of the matter, talking about the unknowns that are involved,\u201d Neal said. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t imagine that we would walk back to safety precautions that had been universally well-accepted.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPostSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPostReporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned two lower court judges and upheld California\u2019s ban on high-capacity magazines Tuesday in a split decision that may be headed for the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201cThe statute outlaws no weapon, but only limits the size of the magazine that may be used with firearms,\u201d the judges ruled in the 7-4 decision.The majority reasoned that \u201cthe record demonstrates that the limitation interferes only minimally with the core right of self-defense, as there is no evidence that anyone ever has been unable to defend his or her home and family due to the lack of a large-capacity magazine; and ... that the limitation saves lives.\u201dThe en banc panel of the San Francisco-based court acted after two of three judges on a smaller 9th Circuit panel last year ruled that the state\u2019s ban on magazines holding more than 10 bullets violates the U.S. Constitution\u2019s protection of the right to bear firearms.Gunowners\u2019 rights groups have been trying to get firearms cases before a more conservative U.S. Supreme Court and immediately promised to seek the high court\u2019s review.Seven judges on the 11-member 9th Circuit panel were appointed by Democratic presidents, but the nation\u2019s high court tilted to the right under with appointees by former President Donald Trump.The three-judge panel had backed a 2017 ruling by San Diego-based U.S. District Judge Roger Benitez that declared unconstitutional a state law that since 2000 had prohibited buying or selling such magazines. That law barred new sales or imports but let those who had the magazines before then keep them.The lower court ruling also barred the state from enforcing a voter-approved law that would have barred gun owners from possessing magazines holding more than 10 bullets.Aside from the effect on high-capacity magazine laws in California and other states, the ruling helps to unjam a roadblock in other pending cases over the state\u2019s ban on assault weapons.Everytown for Gun Safety, a leading group seeking firearms restrictions, said state officials\u2019 appeal of Benitez\u2019s ruling this year throwing out California\u2019s assault weapon restrictions was on hold while the 9th Circuit considered the ban on high-capacity magazines.The assault weapons ruling is also on hold while the appeals court considers the same issues in a different case, where a different federal judge upheld the state\u2019s ban in 2018.Aside from the merits of each case, the appeals court is weighing the legal standard that courts must consider in Second Amendment cases. Gunowners groups are hopeful that the recently more conservative U.S. Supreme Court will change the legal tests in their favor.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

No cause of death was given.\u201cI will remember her laughter, her joy, her dignity as she navigated the challenges that she faced,\u201d Lamas said. \u201cShe truly was a force of nature.\u201dIn 1959\u2032s \u201cJourney to the Center of the Earth,\u201d an adaptation of Jules Verne\u2019s sci-fi classic, Dahl plays the widow of a scientist who joins co-stars James Mason and Pat Boone on a harrowing race to the earth\u2019s core.She sang and danced in 1950\u2032s \u201cThree Little Words,\u201d a musical biopic of songwriters Bert Kalmar and Harry Ruby, playing Ruby\u2019s wife Eileen Percy opposite frequent co-star Red Skelton.She co-starred with Bob Hope in 1953\u2032s \u201cHere Come the Girls,\u201d provided the love interest for Skelton in 1950\u2032s \u201cWatch the Birdie\u2019\u201d and played the hero\u2019s sweetheart in such adventures as 1952\u2032s \u201cCaribbean\u201d with John Payne, 1953\u2032s \u201cJamaica Run\u201d with Ray Milland and 1954\u2032s \u201cBengal Brigade\u201d with Rock Hudson.Dahl became as famous for her six marriages as for her acting career.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 Jussie Smollett \u201cis a real victim\u201d of a \u201creal crime,\u201d his attorney said in opening statements at the ex-\u201cEmpire\u201d actor\u2019s trial Monday, rejecting prosecutors\u2019 allegation that he staged  a homophobic and racist attack  in Chicago after the television studio where he worked didn\u2019t take hate mail he had received seriously.Defense attorney Nenye Uche said two brothers attacked Smollett in January 2019 because they didn\u2019t like him, and that a $3,500 check  the actor paid the men was for training so he could prepare for an upcoming music video, not as payment for staging a hate crime, as prosecutors allege. Uche also suggested a third attacker was involved and told jurors there is not a \u201cshred \u201c of physical and forensic evidence linking Smollett to the crime prosecutors allege.\u201cJussie Smollett is a real victim,\u201d Uche said.Special prosecutor Dan Webb said the actor recruited the brothers to help him carry out a fake attack, then reported it to Chicago police, who classified it as a hate crime and spent 3,000 staff hours on the investigation. Smollett said he was attacked by supporters of then-President Donald Trump, a report that ignited political and ideological divisions around the country.\u201cWhen he reported the fake hate crime that was a real crime,\u201d said Webb, who was named as special prosecutor after Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx\u2019s office dropped the original charges filed against Smollett. A new indictment was returned in 2020.Smollett, who arrived at the courthouse in Chicago Monday with his mother and other family members, is charged with felony disorderly conduct. The class 4 felony carries a prison sentence of up to three years, but experts have said it is likely that if Smollett is convicted he would be placed on probation and perhaps ordered to perform community service.Webb told jurors Smollett was unhappy about how the studio handled the letter he received. That letter included a drawing of a stick figure hanging from a tree and \u201cMAGA,\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again campaign slogan, Webb said.He said Smollett then concocted the fake attack and had a \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d with the two brothers \u2014 who worked on the \u201cEmpire\u201d set with Smollett \u2014 including telling them to shout racial and homophobic slurs and \u201cMAGA.\u201d Smollett also told the brothers to buy ski masks, red hats and a rope, Webb told jurors.\u201cHe told them to use a rope to make it look like a hate crime,\u201d Webb said.But Uche said Smollett had turned down extra security when the studio offered it. He also portrayed the brothers, Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo, as unreliable, saying their story has changed while Smollett\u2019s has not, and that when police searched their home they found heroin and guns.Twelve jurors plus three alternates were sworn in late Monday for a trial that Judge James Linn said he expects to take about one week. Cameras are not allowed inside the courtroom and the proceedings are not being livestreamed, unlike in other recent high-profile trials.Whether Smollett, who is Black and gay, will testify remains an open question. But the siblings will take the witness stand.Jurors also may see surveillance video from more than four dozen cameras that police reviewed to trace the brothers\u2019 movements before and after the reported attack, as well as a video showing the brothers purchasing supplies hours earlier.Buried in nearly 500 pages of Chicago Police Department reports is a statement from an area resident who says she saw a white man with \u201creddish brown hair\u201d who appeared to be waiting for someone that night. She told a detective that when the man turned away from her, she \u201ccould see hanging out from underneath his jacket what appeared to be a rope.\u201dHer comments could back up Smollett\u2019s contention that his attackers draped a makeshift noose around his neck. Further, if she testified that the man was white, it would support Smollett\u2019s statements \u2014 widely ridiculed because the brothers, who come from Nigeria, are Black \u2014 that he saw pale or white skin around the eyes of one of his masked attackers.___Check out the AP\u2019s complete coverage  of the Jussie Smollett case.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Carrie Meek, the grandchild of a slave and a sharecropper\u2019s daughter who became one of the first Black Floridians elected to Congress since Reconstruction, died Sunday. She was 95.Meek died at her home in Miami after a long illness, her family said in a statement. The family did not specify a cause of death.Meek started her congressional career at an age when many people begin retirement. She was 66 when she easily won the 1992 Democratic congressional primary in her Miami-Dade County district. No Republican opposed her in the general election.Alcee Hastings and Corrine Brown joined Meek in January 1993 as the first Black Floridians to serve in Congress since 1876 as the state\u2019s districts had been redrawn by the federal courts in accordance with the 1965 Voting Rights Act.On her first day in Congress, Meek reflected that while her grandmother, a slave on a Georgia farm, could never have dreamed of such an accomplishment, her parents told her that anything was possible.\u201cThey always said the day would come when we would be recognized for our character,\u201d she told The Associated Press in an interview that day.In Congress, Meek championed affirmative action, economic opportunities for the poor and efforts to bolster democracy in and ease immigration restrictions on Haiti, the birthplace of many of her constituents.She also was known for her liberal opinions, folksy yet powerful oratory and colorful Republican bashing.\u201cThe last Republican that did something for me was Abraham Lincoln,\u201d she told the state delegation to the 1996 Democratic Convention in Chicago.Meek joined her son Kendrick, a former state trooper and state senator, in a 2000 sit-in at then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s office to protest an end to affirmative action policies. She had long argued in favor of such policies, since earning her master\u2019s degree from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 1948. At the time, Blacks were not admitted to graduate schools in Florida.Meek decided not to seek a sixth term in 2002. Her son Kendrick succeeded in winning her heavily Democratic district, a seat he held for four terms before an unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate in 2010.After leaving Congress, Carrie Meek returned to Miami and created a foundation to work on education and housing issues. She was also criticized for some of her business dealings.She lobbied for a biotech park that was planned for Miami\u2019s impoverished Liberty City neighborhood but never materialized. County authorities eventually started a criminal investigation, and the park\u2019s developer was arrested in October 2009 on charges that he stole nearly $1 million from the project.Congressional records showed that Meek was paid while her son sought millions of federal dollars for the project. Meek said she was paid as a consultant, and both mother and son denied their efforts were linked.Before entering politics, Meek worked as a teacher and administrator at Miami-Dade College.She was elected to the Florida House in 1978, succeeding pioneer Black legislator Gwen Cherry, who had been killed in an auto accident. She became one of the first African Americans and the first Black woman to serve in the Florida Senate since the 1800sCarrie Pittman was born to Willie and Carrie Pittman in Tallahassee on April 29, 1926, and was the youngest of 12 children. Her father worked in nearby fields as a sharecropper and her mother took in laundry from white families.She graduated from Florida A&M University in 1946 with a degree in biology and physical education. The university named its building for Black history archives in her honor in 2007. She was a member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority.She accepted a position at Bethune Cookman College as an instructor and became the institution\u2019s first female basketball coach. In 1958, she returned to Florida A&M as an instructor in health and physical education. She held that position until 1961.Meek continued her teaching career at Miami Dade Community College as the first Black professor, associate dean, and assistant to the Vice President from 1961 to 1979.Then, she began her trailblazing political career, representing Florida\u2019s 17th Congressional District as a Democratic Florida State House Representative.In Congress, Meek was a member of the powerful Appropriations Committee and worked to secure $100 million in aid to rebuild Dade County as the area recovered from Hurricane Andrew.She retired in 2002 and shifted her focus to the Carrie Meek Foundation, which she founded in November 2001, to provide the Miami-Dade community with much-needed resources, opportunities, and jobs. Meek spearheaded the Foundation\u2019s daily operations until 2015 when she stepped down due to declining health.Meek is survived by her children Lucia Davis-Raiford, Sheila Davis Kinui and Kendrick B. Meek, seven grandchildren, five great-grandchildren and multiple nieces and nephews.Funeral arrangements are pending.In a statement, Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava called Meek a \u201ctrue trailblazer.\u201d\u201cShe was never afraid to use her voice to speak out against inequality or to fight for the disenfranchised and the vulnerable \u2014 and her towering legacy will continue to shape our community and the nation for generations to come,\u201d Levine Cava said.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Federal law prohibits interfering with a flight crew, including assaulting, intimidating or threatening crew members.In a statement, Garland said such passengers do more than harm employees. \u201cThey prevent the performance of critical duties that help ensure safe air travel. Similarly, when passengers commit violent acts against other passengers in the close confines of a commercial aircraft, the conduct endangers everyone aboard,\u201d he said.The memo also notes that dozens of incidents have been reported to the FBI by the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 it investigates some flight disturbances and can issue civil fines to disruptive passengers \u2014 as part of an \u201cinformation-sharing protocol\u201d between the two agencies.The FAA said earlier this month that it had launched 950 investigations into passenger behavior on flights this year. That is the highest total since the agency started keeping track in 1995. In the five years from 2016 through 2020, the agency averaged 136 investigations a year.The agency also said that it had referred 37 cases involving unruly airline passengers to the FBI for possible criminal prosecution since the number of disruptions on flights began to spike in January.\u201cThe unacceptable disruptive behavior that we\u2019re seeing is a serious safety threat to flights, and we\u2019re committed to our partnership with the DOJ to combat it,\u201d FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said.Airlines and their unions have pressed the federal government to push more aggressively for criminal prosecution. Airlines have reported more than 5,000 incidents involving unruly passengers this year, with more than 3,600 of those involving people who refused to wear face masks as required by federal regulation.\u201cThe Department of Justice is committed to using its resources to do its part to prevent violence, intimidation, threats of violence and other criminal behavior that endangers the safety of passengers, flight crews and flight attendants on commercial aircraft,\u201d Garland said in the statement.The international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO, Sara Nelson, also applauded Garland\u2019s announcement.\u201cConsequences need to be swift and clear to keep travel safe and protect the people on the frontlines who have worked through all the stresses of this pandemic,\u201d Nelson said in a statement. \u201cWe want to take people to New Orleans, Seattle, Fort Lauderdale, or to see Grandma.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostThe U.S. Supreme Court announced Wednesday that it will hear a case that North Carolina Republicans have brought over the right to defend the state\u2019s voter identification law. The law in question was passed in 2018 and requires that everyone in North Carolina have a photo ID to vote. The state\u2019s chapter of the NAACP immediately challenged it, saying such a stipulation disproportionately impacts Black and Latinx voters.Since then, the state\u2019s Republican lawmakers have lodged a complaint that Gov. Roy Cooper and state Attorney General Joshua Stein \u2015 both Democrats \u2015 have not adequately defended the law against such legal challenges. The lawmakers sought to intervene in the defense against the NAACP lawsuit. After the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that they could not step in, the GOP-controlled legislature asked the Supreme Court in August to consider the demands. In their request, the lawmakers cited the governor\u2019s opposition to the law, which he vetoed only to have the legislature override his decision.\u201cIn his veto statement, he alleged that the bill has \u2018sinister and cynical origins\u2019 and was \u2018designed to suppress the rights of minority, poor and elderly voters,\u2019\u201d the lawmakers wrote, saying Cooper and Stein are not fairly representing the state.The questions presented by the case \u201cstrike at the heart of a State\u2019s sovereign authority to designate agents to represent its interests in court,\u201d the request continued. \u201cAnd as this case demonstrates, they are of particular importance in the context of divided government and litigation involving controversial matters.\u201dStein filed a response with the court asking it not to take on the case, saying that the state is already adequately defending the law and that because these types of issues arise so infrequently, it\u2019s not appropriate for the Supreme Court to intervene.Voter ID laws have grown into one of the most contentious issues around fair elections in recent years as GOP-controlled states began accelerating such restrictions. Democrats largely say they\u2019re a tool of voter suppression (though studies find that effect may be minimal) and point to research that shows voter ID laws do nothing to combat voter fraud (which is already extremely rare).The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments and make a decision in the case by next summer.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Biden administration\u2019s vaccine mandate for millions of federal workers seems to be working, with no apparent disruption to law enforcement, intelligence-gathering or holiday travel.On Tuesday, one day after the deadline for compliance, 92% of the 3.5 million federal workers covered by Biden\u2019s mandate reported to the government that they are at least partially vaccinated, according to White House officials.The highest number of partial vaccinations by Tuesday was at the Agency for International Development, which had 97.8%, followed closely by the Department of Health and Human Services at 96.4% and State Department at 96.1%, according to data provided by the White House Wednesday.Law enforcement agencies do lag behind in vaccines, with the Justice Department at 89.8%. The Department of Veterans Affairs is at 87.8% of partial vaccinations, though the Defense Department was 93.4% and the Homeland Security Department was 88.9%. The government office with the lowest number of partially vaccinated employees was the Agriculture Department, at 86.1%.But overall, 96.5% of federal employees have been deemed in compliance with the policy, which also includes medical or religious exemptions that are still being evaluated. The rest are considered out of compliance, but officials emphasized that \u201cit\u2019s not a cliff,\u201d and that workers will receive counseling to get vaccinated or file for an exemption. Only then would termination be considered.\u201cWe know vaccine requirements work,\u201d said White House assistant press secretary Kevin Munoz. \u201cWe hope that our implementation sends the clear message to businesses to move forward with similar measures that will protect their workforce, protect their customers, and protect our communities.\u201dWhite House officials said the data was just a snapshot and the numbers would continue to rise in the days and weeks ahead. As they work through additional vaccines and exceptions, there will be no disruptions to government services, the officials said.Since instituting the initial vaccine-or-test mandate this summer and then the more-restrictive requirement without a test-out option this fall, the White House has believed the federal government could serve as a model for the rest of the nation\u2019s employers for how vaccinations could help shepherd a quicker return to the normal.White House officials say the most important lesson for businesses from the federal experience is that once they take the first step toward requirements, their workers will follow.The numbers from the Internal Revenue Service show how a mandate can drive up the vaccination rate. About 25% of the agency\u2019s workforce first got a shot after Biden announced the mandate in September; now, 98% are in compliance.Agencies with marginally lower vaccination rates tend to have widely dispersed workforces, making education and counseling about the benefits of vaccines \u2014 or even just the task of getting workers to self-report that they\u2019ve already gotten a shot \u2013 more difficult.There is still some resistance. The union representing federal prison workers filed a lawsuit seeking to block the mandate, arguing it\u2019s an unfair labor practice and violates employees\u2019 free speech and privacy rights. Shane Fausey, the president of the Council of Prison Locals, said in a Wednesday letter to members that more than 3,500 federal Bureau of Prisons employees \u2014 about 10% of the agency\u2019s workforce \u2014 were being issued counseling letters and face possible termination for not complying with the mandate.Fausey\u2019s letter repeated misinformation about the vaccine, including claims that it doesn\u2019t stop the spread of COVID-19 and that it does not reduce the \u201coverall adverse medical effects of the virus.\u201d Lawyers Bruce Castor and Michael van der Veen, who represented former President Donald Trump at his second impeachment trial, are representing the union.As of late October, several intelligence agencies apparently had at least 20% of their workforce unvaccinated, said Republican Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah, a member of the House Intelligence Committee.Some of the initial fears about the vaccination status of the federal workforce stemmed from employees without access to government computers to make their vaccination certification. Some, like front-line Transportation Security Administration officers, rarely use a government computer. Others are in the field or simply delayed responding to the survey or beginning vaccination.The federal vaccination rate outpaces the rate of vaccination for all Americans. About 82.2% of American adults, or more than 212 million people, have received at least one dose. Of them about 71%, or over 183 million, are fully vaccinated.___ Associated Press Writer Michael R.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostWhile many states run by Republicans passed new restrictions on voting in the wake of the 2020 election, the states where Democrats controlled most or all of the levers of government did the opposite and increased voter access and voting rights.In total, 25 states enacted legislation to expand voter access and voting rights, while 19 states enacted restrictive election laws, according to a review of state laws by the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit that supports voting rights. Some states expanded voter access in certain ways while restricting it in other ways.States that President Joe Biden won in last year\u2019s election, and where Democrats control the state legislature, accounted for the majority of the expansive voter access laws enacted in 2021. And, in large part, the increase in voter access and expansion of voting rights in these states followed on from the successful implementation of policies during the COVID-19 pandemic that were designed to make it easier to vote.\u201cThere is this emerging divide in America where places where it\u2019s easier to vote pass these more expansive policies, and the opposite is true in places where it is already hard to vote,\u201d Jasleen Singh, a voting rights attorney with the Brennan Center, said.Almost every state adopted emergency election rules in 2020 to ensure that people could vote without worrying about contracting the coronavirus in a crowded indoor space. These changes included allowing anyone to cast an absentee ballot, sending every voter an application for a mail ballot (or the ballot itself), opening drive-thru voting locations, placing absentee ballot drop boxes, easing voter registration rules, providing more time for ballots to arrive, and allowing voters an opportunity to correct errors on their mailed ballots. Americans responded to these changes by voting at the highest rate in a century.\u201cThe pandemic, and people\u2019s use of these expanded policies, definitely signals to state legislatures that when these methods are available to make it easier to vote, people are going to use them,\u201d Singh said. \u201cAnd they turned out to be incredibly popular.\u201dThis, at least, is how it worked in states with Democratic-run legislatures. In most states run by Republicans, politicians responded to Donald Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud and enacted new restrictions on voting, specifically restricting the kind of voting practices popularly used during the pandemic. This was particularly true in states where Biden made big gains over previous years, like Arizona, Georgia and Texas.Democratic control of the state legislature was the biggest predictor of whether a state expanded voter access in 2021. Expansions of voter access and voting rights passed in all but one state (Rhode Island) where Democrats controlled both chambers of the legislature. This included states with Republican governors like Maryland, Massachusetts and Vermont.Election laws passed in New York and Nevada also included some policies that the Brennan Center categorizes as restrictions on voting \u2015 respectively, shortening the window to mail back ballot applications and increasing the number of voters per precinct. Kentucky and Louisiana, both of which have Republican legislatures and Democratic governors, also adopted election laws that mixed expansions of voter access with restrictions, as did the entirely Republican-run Indiana and Oklahoma. North Dakota was the only entirely Republican-run state to expand voter access without also limiting aspects of it.Many of the biggest election law changes that expanded the right to vote flowed from best practices adopted during the pandemic.California, Nevada and Vermont passed legislation to move to all-mail elections (while maintaining in-person voting options) by sending every registered voter a mail-in ballot. Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Virginia all enacted new laws to ease rules around mail-in voting, whether by permanently adopting no-excuse absentee voting, sending every voter a mail-in ballot application or otherwise making it easier to vote by mail. Additionally, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, extended the state\u2019s order allowing voters to use the pandemic as an acceptable excuse to cast a mail-in absentee ballot.California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey and Vermont either expanded the use of drop boxes for mail-in ballots or permanently adopted the use of drop boxes. Illinois also permanently adopted a policy allowing curbside voting, and Vermont adopted drive-thru voting, both of which were successful pandemic innovations.\u201cSpecifically with the mail-in voting bills, that was a direct reaction [to the pandemic],\u201d Joanne Antoine, executive director of Common Cause Maryland, a nonprofit backing voting rights legislation, said.Previous attempts to pass legislation in Maryland simply to create a study of mail voting failed due to opposition in the state House of Delegates. But this year, both chambers adopted legislation to allow mail-in voting and approve the mailing of ballot applications to all registered voters.\u201cIt was interesting to see, because of the pandemic, the willingness,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cIt was almost as though everyone had a change of heart and they realized that this can work.\u201dNot every change can be chalked up to the pandemic. In some cases, states adopted policies that had long been sought by advocates of greater voter access and voting rights.Connecticut, New York and Washington state all restored voting rights to people formerly incarcerated with felony convictions. Maryland made it possible for people held in jails pre-trial to vote.Delaware and Hawaii adopted automatic voter registration for the first time, while Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Nevada and New York all expanded their automatic voter registration programs by including more government offices as sites to register voters.Meanwhile, Virginia became the first state to adopt a state-level Voting Rights Act creating a process to review and prevent local jurisdictions from implementing discriminatory voting practices.Many states have constitutions that include all of the state\u2019s election rules. If legislators in one of these states want to change election rules, they need to amend the state constitution. This can be a more onerous and time-consuming process than simply passing legislation, and is fraught with greater potential for failure.State legislatures often need to pass resolutions in favor of constitutional amendments in successive sessions. Then the amendments are put on the ballot for voters to decide on their adoption.In Connecticut, lawmakers passed resolutions in favor of amendments to allow early in-person voting and no-excuse absentee voting. Since neither resolution received 75% of the vote in the state House of Representatives, they will need to pass in successive sessions and then be placed on the ballot for voters. Early in-person voting already passed in a previous session, so it will appear on the ballot in 2022. No-excuse absentee voting needs to pass in one more session before it can appear on the ballot in 2024.But in other states, the hurdles to passing constitutional amendments to make it easier to vote were too high.Every Republican in the Delaware House of Representatives voted against a constitutional amendment authorizing no-excuse absentee voting, denying it the two-thirds majority required to pass. The resolution needed to pass in two consecutive legislative sessions to be put on the ballot. Twelve Republicans previously voted for the same amendment in 2019, but now echo Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud as their rationale for voting no in 2021.In New York, voters rejected constitutional amendments to allow same-day voter registration and no-excuse absentee voting. Both amendments faced a multimillion-dollar opposition campaign funded by conservative billionaire Ronald Lauder, while receiving no support from the state Democratic Party, which until recently had made no effort to expand voter access in the state. The amendments also fared poorly due to low voter turnout from Democrats in New York City and across the state.These local failures help to highlight the national polarization of Republicans and Democrats on voting rights policies. For advocates of voting rights, they also illustrate the importance of enacting federal reforms like those currently being blocked by Republican filibusters in the Senate, such as the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.\u201cBecause of this patchwork of policies that we\u2019re seeing, and difficulty of enacting or not enacting certain legislation, this is a moment where it\u2019s incredibly important for Congress to step in,\u201d Singh said.Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gambled last year that his ultra-low rate policies would help revive an economy that had sunk deep into a pandemic-induced recession. So far, his bet has mostly paid off.Growth and hiring have rebounded faster than anyone expected. President Joe Biden, citing his commitment to lowering unemployment, on Monday picked him for another four-year term.Yet Powell\u2019s challenge is hardly over. Inflation has jumped to a three-decade high, and Powell\u2019s efforts to contain it will constitute the stiffest test of his next term. In doing so, he will also have to grapple with additional complications, from the unusual nature of the pandemic recovery to the risk of getting ahead of other central banks around the world.Getting inflation under control will be particularly difficult because the Fed isn\u2019t facing a traditionally overheating economy. Normally, the central bank can cool runaway growth, and the threat of high inflation, by raising its benchmark interest rate, which affects other loan rates throughout the economy. Doing so tends to slow borrowing and spending.This time, huge government stimulus spending, the release of pent-up demand as the economy reopened and the Fed\u2019s own policies \u2014 it\u2019s kept its short-term rate near zero since March 2020 \u2014 has supercharged consumer demand. The spending surge has mostly been funneled into goods like cars, furniture and electronics. The jump in demand has clogged ports and railways and collided with labor and supply shortages. That combination of factors isn\u2019t something the Fed can fix.\u201cThis isn\u2019t your garden-variety inflation spike,\u201d said Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University who has studied the Fed. \u201cThis pandemic economy is different. There\u2019s really no playbook for: How do you get the soft landing the Fed is always aiming for?\u201dAt the same time, the economy still has 4 million fewer jobs than it did before the pandemic. Under a new policy framework the Fed adopted last year, it has placed a renewed emphasis on reaching maximum employment. Should the Fed miscalculate and keep rates too low for too long to try to spur further job growth, price increases could accelerate. The central bank would then have to resort to sharper rate hikes to bring inflation back down. That, in turn, would risk causing another recession.\u201c2022, without question, is going to be one of the hardest years that the Fed has had to navigate,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, a senior fellow at the Jain Family Institute and former Federal Reserve economist. \u201cThey have a very complicated task ahead of them.\u201dBy most measures, the economy has fared quite well this year, even though high prices have undercut Americans\u2019 confidence in it and made it harder for many households to afford food, fuel and other necessities. On Monday, while introducing Powell and his nominee for vice chair \u2014 Lael Brainard, a member of the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors \u2014 Biden declared that the U.S. economy has \u201cgone from an economy that was shut down to an economy that\u2019s leading the world in economic growth.\u201d He credited his own policies and the Fed\u2019s as well.\u201cThings are getting better for American workers,\u201d the president said. \u201cHigher wages, better benefits, more flexible schedules. ... Savings are up, home equity is up.\u201dYet consumer prices also skyrocketed 6.2% in the 12 months that ended in October, the fastest year-over-year jump since 1990. Powell, after having previously describing high inflation as merely \u201ctransitory,\u201d now acknowledges that it could persist well into next year.Most analysts expect the Fed to raise rates at least twice in 2022 to try to rein in inflation, which the Fed wants to average 2% annually over time. But those rate increases will create their own challenges. Under the new framework devised by Powell and Brainard among others, the Fed wants maximum employment that is \u201cbroad and inclusive.\u201d That means it will take account of other data points, like the unemployment rate for Black Americans, rather than just the overall jobless rate.Yet even if the overall jobless rate falls below 4% next year \u2014 it\u2019s 4.6% now \u2014 which would be close to what many Fed officials regard as full employment, African-American joblessness would likely be much higher, given the perennial racial gap in unemployment. Black unemployment is 7.9% now.Stephanie Aaronson, a former Fed economist who now directs economic studies at the Brookings Institution, noted that the Fed has frequently said it wants to keep the economy growing as robustly as possible, to help disadvantaged workers regain employment or earn higher pay. If the central bank instead starts to hike rates to choke off inflation, it could forestall some of those potential gains in employment.If that should happen, Aaronson said, \u201cthey\u2019re going to have to say why they didn\u2019t wait longer.\u201dFed officials, she added, could note that high inflation also hurts lower-income workers.\u201cThey can articulate this, but they\u2019ve got to get started,\u201d Aaronson said.Joseph Stiglitz, an economist at Columbia University and Nobel Prize laureate in economics, suggested that the Fed also has to consider the global consequences of its policies. The European Central Bank, for example, has indicated that it still sees higher inflation as mostly a temporary phenomenon. That suggests that Powell could raise rates before the ECB does, particularly if he does so in the first half of next year.\u201cThat will lead to an increase in the (dollar) exchange rate that will decrease our exports, that will lower American competitiveness and that will weaken our economy,\u201d warned Stiglitz, who favored Brainard for Fed chair.___AP Economics Writer Paul Wiseman contributed to this report.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Labor Reporter, HuffPostPresident Joe Biden\u2019s administration says hundreds of thousands of workers could see bigger paychecks starting next year due to its new minimum wage for federal contractors.The Labor Department said Monday that it had finalized a regulation that sets a $15 wage floor for workers under federal contracts. Firms providing services to the U.S. government will have to pay workers at least that much under contracts implemented or renewed starting Jan. 30, 2022.The federal government already sets contractor minimums through prevailing wage law. But Jessica Looman, acting administrator for the Labor Department\u2019s Wage and Hour Division, said on a press call Monday that there are 327,000 workers under federal contracts who are currently entitled to less than $15 per hour. Officials expect many of those workers to get raises as a result of the new regulation. Looman said restaurant workers, child care workers and maintenance workers are some of the most likely to see pay boosts. \u201cThe bottom line is we really want to make sure we are leveraging the purchasing power of the federal government to ensure fair wages for workers across the country,\u201d Looman said.Biden had signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to develop the regulation back in April.The rule covers not just workers on federal properties but anyone who works under a service or construction contract with the government. It applies in all U.S. territories and states, many of which have local minimum wages well below $15 per hour. Workers in those areas are likely to see the most impact from the rule, Looman said.After the initial bump to $15, the wage rate will be tied to an inflation index so that it increases with the cost of living, requiring firms to adjust their minimums each year. The rule will also eliminate the tipped minimum wage by 2024, requiring firms to pay the full minimum wage, not counting gratuities, at restaurants and other businesses under federal contracts.\u201cThe bottom line is we really want to make sure we are leveraging the purchasing power of the federal government to ensure fair wages for workers across the country.\u201dThe rule will have no direct bearing on the vast majority of workers whose jobs are not tied to federal contracts. However, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said Monday that the administration hopes the rule will encourage higher wages at competing businesses.\u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cIt also ensures that the federal government leads by example when we talk about creating good jobs for workers all across this country.\u201dUsing the procurement process to influence working conditions at private companies is nothing new. Presidents going back to Franklin Delano Roosevelt have used federal contracting rules to address discrimination and other workplace issues. Such rules have far less impact than an act of Congress that applies to the entire private sector, but proponents say they allow presidents to raise standards for at least some workers unilaterally.The new minimum wage rule is essentially an update to an earlier rule issued by Barack Obama\u2019s administration, which set $10.10 per hour as a minimum under federal contracts starting in 2015. Due to inflation adjustments, that minimum now sits at $10.95, meaning Biden\u2019s change to $15 will amount to a large and sudden raise.House Democrats have passed a bill that would enact a federal minimum wage of $15, but Democrats in the Senate haven\u2019t managed to bring all of their colleagues on board and face universal opposition from Republicans. The federal minimum is still $7.25 per hour and hasn\u2019t been raised in more than a decade. The federal government does not keep great data on the pay of federal contractors, so it\u2019s hard to know exactly how many workers will see a wage increase. Earlier this year, the Economic Policy Institute estimated that a hike to $15 would create direct raises for up to 390,000 workers, a potentially larger number than the Labor Department estimated. EPI said the average pay increase would be around $3,100 annually.Employers will have to pay higher wages as a result of the rule, but they may bake those costs into their bids on contracts so that the government ends up footing the bill rather than private companies. Walsh argued that raising wages for the lowest-paid contractors will ensure that work performed for the government \u201cwill be done better and faster.\u201dLabor Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Peter Welch, announced Monday that he will run for the U.S. Senate seat now held by Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy.Welch\u2019s decision comes a week after the 81-year-old Leahy\u2019s announcement that he will not seek reelection to the seat he first won in 1974.The 74-year-old Welch said the 2022 election will determine control of the Senate and, with it, what he can accomplish for Vermont families.\u201cWe are at a pivotal moment,\u201d Welch said in a statement distributed by his campaign. \u201cVermont families are struggling through multiple crises: a global pandemic, the consequences of climate change, and a racial reckoning generations in the making.\u201dHe said that if elected he would be ready to fight for progressive change from the first day in office.He promised to continue to fight to ensure working families have access to child care and paid family leave. He said he also would work to pass a Green New Deal to protect the environment, lower the cost of health care and prescription drug costs, ensure that women have control over their own health care decisions and protect voting rights and American democracy.The decisions by Leahy and now Welch will create the first open seats in Vermont\u2019s three-member congressional delegation since 2006, when independent Bernie Sanders moved to the Senate and Welch took his seat in the House.While the Senate seat will be open, Welch, who during his years in the House has been consistently one of Vermont\u2019s top vote-getters, would have an instant advantage.Vermont\u2019s popular Republican governor, Phil Scott, has said he is not interested in running for the Senate. It\u2019s unclear whom the state GOP will find to run for either the Senate seat or the House seat.Vermont has never sent a woman or a member of a racial minority community to Washington. Several female politicians have expressed interest in running for a vacant seat, but the only person who has said she would run for the House if Welch ran for the Senate is Democratic state Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale.Welch, of Norwich, was first elected to the U.S. House in 2006.During his years in the House, he has worked for energy efficiency, cutting the prices of prescription drugs, investing in infrastructure and expanding broadband into rural areas of Vermont and the country.As of this year, Welch served as a chief deputy whip of the House Democratic Caucus and a member of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee.In the House, he has served on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Oversight and Reform.Welch has developed a spot for himself in the House and is well liked there, said Linda Fowler, professor emerita of government at Dartmouth College.Welch was born in Springfield, Massachusetts. He moved to Vermont in the early 1970s after graduating from law school. He served as a public defender and founded his own law firm.He was elected to the Vermont Senate in 1980 and became the first Democrat elected as Senate president pro tempore in 1985. He was reelected to the state Senate in 2002 and served in that role until he was was elected to the House four years later.Welch said even though the country is facing extreme challenges he is optimistic.\u201cI\u2019ve seen Vermonters come together to solve problems,\u201d he said. \u201cWe focus on solutions, not who gets credit. That\u2019s the Vermont way.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Joe Biden announced Monday that he\u2019s nominating Jerome Powell for a second four-year term as Federal Reserve chair, endorsing Powell\u2019s stewardship of the economy through a brutal pandemic recession in which the Fed\u2019s ultra-low rate policies helped bolster confidence and revitalize the job market.Biden also said he would nominate Lael Brainard, the lone Democrat on the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors and the preferred alternative to Powell among many progressives, as vice chair. The president said he will fill the three remaining slots on the board, including a vice chair for supervision, a bank regulatory post, in early December.Biden\u2019s decision, reached after extensive consideration, strikes a note of continuity and bipartisanship at a time when surging inflation is burdening households and raising risks to the economy\u2019s recovery. In backing Powell, a Republican who was first elevated to his post by President Donald Trump, Biden brushed aside complaints from progressives that the Fed has weakened bank regulation and has been slow to take account of climate change in its supervision of banks.If confirmed by the Senate, Powell would remain one of the most powerful economic officials in the world. By either raising or lowering its benchmark interest rate, the Fed seeks to either cool or stimulate growth and hiring, and to keep prices stable. Its efforts to direct the U.S. economy, the largest in the world, typically have global consequences.The Fed\u2019s short-term rate, which has been pegged near zero since the pandemic hammered the economy in March 2020, influences a wide range of consumer and business borrowing costs, including for mortgages and credit cards. The Fed also oversees the nation\u2019s largest banks.In a second term, to begin in February, Powell would face a difficult and high-risk balancing act: Rising inflation is causing hardships for millions of families, clouding the economic recovery and undercutting the Fed\u2019s mandate to keep prices stable. But with the economy still 4 million-plus jobs shy of its pre-pandemic level, the Fed has yet to meet its other mandate of maximizing employment.If the Fed moves too slowly to raise rates, inflation may accelerate further and force the Fed to take more draconian steps later to rein it in, potentially causing a recession. Yet if the Fed hikes rates too quickly, it could choke off hiring and the economic recovery.Powell\u2019s re-nomination must be approved in a vote by the Senate Banking Committee and then confirmed by the full Senate, which is considered likely.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2015 President Joe Biden on Monday cited the need for stability and bipartisan appeal amid persisting inflation and a not-yet-vanquished pandemic as reasons for giving Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell a second term, rejecting calls from progressives for someone more in line with their politics.\u201cSome will no doubt question why I\u2019m renominating Jay, when he was the choice of a Republican predecessor. Why am I not picking a Democrat? Why am I not picking fresh blood, or taking the Fed in a different direction?\u201d Biden said, explicitly stating his desire to depoliticize the central bank.\u201cPut directly, at this moment of both enormous potential and enormous uncertainty for our economy, we need stability and independence at the Federal Reserve,\u201d Biden said during brief remarks at an auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building across a driveway from the West Wing. \u201cI believe Jay is the right person to see us through.\u201dMany progressives, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, had wanted Biden to choose current Federal Reserve Board of Governors member Lael Brainard, who was previously a Treasury Department undersecretary in the Barack Obama administration, an economic adviser in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House and has taught at MIT\u2019s Sloan School of Management.Instead, Biden nominated Brainard for the vice chair position. \u201cShe\u2019s done pioneering work on how the Fed should account for the emerging risk of climate change to our financial system,\u201d Biden said.Both Powell and Brainard reflected on the reality that many Americans see rising costs as a threat to their economic security, despite months of White House officials projecting confidence that higher prices would be \u201ctransitory\u201d as the global economy came out of the pandemic-induced recession.\u201cWe know that high inflation takes a toll on families, especially those less able to meet the costs of essentials, like food, housing and transportation,\u201d Powell said. \u201cWe\u2019ll use our tools both to support the economy and a strong labor market, and to prevent higher inflation from becoming entrenched.\u201d\u201cThis means getting inflation down at a time when people are focused on their jobs and how far their paychecks will go,\u201d added Brainard.Biden also cited Powell\u2019s willingness to adhere to a policy prioritizing maximum employment, despite repeated attacks by former President Donald Trump who wanted him to maximize stock market levels and keep interest rates near zero.\u201cIn the last administration, he stood up to unprecedented political interference and in doing so successfully maintained the integrity and credibility of his institution,\u201d Biden said.In 2018, Trump refused to renominate then-Chair Janet Yellen \u2015 at least in part because she is not tall, and Trump is disinclined to like short people \u2015 and chose Powell over conservative Stanford economist John Taylor. But Trump not long afterward soured on Powell for not doing enough to ensure Trump\u2019s reelection. He attacked Powell both in public remarks and in Twitter posts, at one time comparing him to China\u2019s authoritarian leader, Xi Jinping. \u201cMy only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powel or Chairman Xi?\u201d Trump wrote in 2019, misspelling Powell\u2019s name.Biden\u2019s administration has overseen a COVID-19 vaccine drive that has successfully inoculated the vast majority of American adults, with a resulting growth in the economy and a reduction of the unemployment rate to 4.6% now compared with 6.3% when he took office in January.His poll numbers nevertheless began falling in the summer, coinciding with a disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan and a surge in coronavirus cases thanks to the spread of the delta variant and the refusal of many Americans to get vaccinated.Biden spent nearly eight minutes Monday prior to ever mentioning Powell\u2019s name pointing out the strength of the economy on his watch, including the return of 5.6 million jobs lost during the pandemic and a spike in the creation of small businesses.\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from an economy that was shut down to an economy that is leading the world in growth,\u201d he said.Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Greg Abbott\u2019s support of civilians owning military-style weapons, now without training and background checks, has threatened that tradition, he said.\u201cMost of us here in Texas \u2026 do not want to see our friends, our family members, our neighbors shot up with these weapons of war,\u201d he said. \u201cSo yes, I still hold this view.\u201dO\u2019Rourke was responding to a question Bash posed about whether he maintains a position he shared in 2019 while expressing support for mandatory buybacks for semiautomatic weapons. He said: \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47, you\u2019re not going to be allowed to use it against your fellow Americans anymore.\u201d AR-15s and AK-47s are semiautomatic rifles designed to kill quickly and in large numbers; the AR-15 has been used in most of the deadliest shootings in the past decade. Both are available in the U.S. and there are no federal restrictions on owning them.\u201cThat AR-15, that AK-47 has one, single solitary purpose, and that is killing people as effectively, as efficiently, in as great a number, in as little time as possible. We saw that in Kenosha. We saw that in El Paso, Texas, where 23 people were murdered by someone with an AK-47 just in a matter of minutes,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThis is crazy. And we should not come to expect this as a matter of course in America.\u201dO\u2019Rourke, a former Texas congressman, is the newest candidate in the state\u2019s 2022 gubernatorial race. Democrats have poured millions of dollars into Texas in recent years, but Republicans have maintained their dominance. Abbott, who is seeking a third term, has emerged as a national figure with his aggressive push for hard-right policies \u2015 including on issues like abortion, voting rights, vaccines, bail reform and gun ownership.On Sunday, O\u2019Rourke brought up a bill Abbott signed into law this past summer that effectively allows any civilian to carry a loaded handgun in public without obtaining a license, completing training or undergoing a background check. The law basically eliminates the last remaining rules for adults possessing a gun in public.Texas has had at least 52 mass shootings so far this year, leaving 59 people dead and 213 injured, according to records kept by the nonprofit group Gun Violence Archive. At the time Abbott passed the relaxed gun law, Texas had at least 22 mass shootings with 23 dead.\u201cI have also been listening to my fellow Texans who are concerned about this idea of permitless carry that Greg Abbott has signed into law, which allows any Texan to carry a loaded firearm, despite the pleadings of police chiefs and law enforcement from across the state, who said it would make their jobs more dangerous and make it harder for them to protect those that they were sworn to serve in their communities,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said.\u201cSo, we don\u2019t want extremism in our gun laws.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A divided House moved toward passage Thursday of Democrats\u2019 expansive social and environment bill  as new cost estimates from Congress\u2019 top fiscal analyst suggested that moderate lawmakers\u2019 spending and deficit worries would be calmed, moving President Joe Biden closer to a badly needed victory.Final debate on the long-delayed legislation came after the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the bill would worsen federal deficits by $160 billion over the coming decade. It also recalculated the measure\u2019s 10-year price tag at $1.68 trillion, though that figure wasn\u2019t directly comparable to a $1.85 trillion figure Democrats have been using.House approval would ship the legislation to the Senate and end \u2014 though just for now \u2014 months of battling between Democrats\u2019 progressives and moderates over its costs and policies. While significant Senate changes are likely due to cost-cutting demands by moderate Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., House passage would edge Biden closer to winning more of his domestic priorities at a time when his public approval is faltering badly.The 2,100-page bill would bolster child care assistance, create free preschool, curb seniors\u2019 prescription drug costs and beef up efforts to slow climate change.\u201cBuild Back Better is a spectacular agenda for the future, with transformational action on health care, family care and climate,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a letter to her colleagues, using the name Biden gave the legislation. She said the measure \u201cwill make a significant difference in the lives of millions of Americans.\u201dAn initial batch of key figures released by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office showed that its projections were aligning closely with earlier estimates from the White House. That included tax credits to spur clean energy development, bolstered child care assistance and extended tax breaks for millions of families with children, lower-earning workers and people buying private health insurance.The measure would provide $109 billion to create free preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds. There were large sums for home health care for seniors, new Medicare coverage for hearing and a new requirement for four weeks of paid family leave. The family leave program, however, was expected to be removed in the Senate, where it\u2019s been opposed by Manchin.In one major difference that was expected, CBO estimated that by spending $80 billion to beef up IRS tax enforcement, the agency would collect $207 billion in new revenue over the coming decade. That meant net savings of $127 billion, well below the White House\u2019s more optimistic $400 billion estimate.In a scorekeeping quirk, CBO formally estimated that the legislation would drive up federal budget deficits by $367 billion over the coming decade. The agency\u2019s budget guidelines technically require it to not count IRS savings when measuring a bill\u2019s deficit impact. But it acknowledged that the measure\u2019s true impact would produce added shortfalls of the lower figure \u2014 $160 billion \u2014 when counting added revenue the IRS would collect.Biden and other Democratic leaders have said the measure would pay for itself, largely through tax increases on the wealthy, big corporations and companies doing business abroad.Republicans said the legislation would damage an economy already racked by inflation, give tax breaks to some wealthy taxpayers and make government bigger and more intrusive. Missouri Rep. Jason Smith, the Budget Committee\u2019s top Republican, echoed the alliteration from \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d to mock it.\u201cBankrupts the economy. Benefits the wealthy. And it builds the Washington machine,\u201d Smith said.Two weeks after centrists\u2019 objections forced Democrats to delay the measure, the party\u2019s divisions seemed all but resolved, for now. Facing uniform Republican opposition, Democrats can lose no more than three votes to prevail in the House.In a significant sign of movement, Florida Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a leading House centrist, said she would back the measure after the latest budget figures persuaded her the legislation \u201cis fiscally disciplined. Despite its flaws, the Build Back Better Act has a lot of positive elements.\u201dBiden this week signed a $1 trillion package of highway and other infrastructure projects, which he\u2019s spent recent days promoting around the country. But he\u2019s been battered recently by falling approval numbers in polls, reflecting voters\u2019 concerns over inflation, supply chain delays and the persistent coronavirus pandemic.After months of talks, Democrats appeared eager to wrap it up, shelving lingering differences to begin selling the package back home. House Democrats said they were planning 1,000 events across the country by year\u2019s end to pitch the measure\u2019s benefits to voters. They face 2022 midterm elections in which Republicans have strong hopes for capturing control of the House and Senate.House passage of the social and environment bill would send it to the 50-50 Senate, where Democrats have zero votes to spare. That\u2019s given enormous leverage to Manchin.Senate talks could take weeks, and the prospect that Manchin or others will force additional cuts in the measure was making it easier for House moderates to back the legislation Thursday. The altered bill would have to return to the House before going to Biden\u2019s desk.When moderates delayed House passage of the bill two weeks ago, they said they wanted to make sure the CBO\u2019s projections for its costs were similar to White House numbers, which showed the measure essentially paid for itself.But some moderates said projections about IRS savings are always uncertain and would not cause them to oppose the measure. Others said the measure\u2019s roughly $555 billion in tax credits and other costs to encourage cleaner energy need not be paid for in the bill because global warming is an existential crisis.CBO estimated that language helping the government curb prescription drug costs would save $297 billion over 10 years. The savings would come from new constraints on pharmaceutical companies\u2019 pricing, but also by blocking a rule on drug company rebates that was initiated by President Donald Trump but never took effect.The bill also would let the government issue work permits to millions of immigrants that would let them stay in the U.S. temporarily. That seemed likely to be changed or eliminated in the Senate, where rules limit provisions allowed in budget bills.The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which preaches fiscal constraint, estimated that the bill\u2019s overall cost would be nearly $5 trillion if Democrats hadn\u2019t made some of its programs temporary. For example, tax credits for children and low-earning workers, top party priorities, are extended for just one year, making their price tags appear lower, even though the party would like those programs to be permanent.___AP Congressional Correspondent Lisa Mascaro and reporter Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Regaining momentum, Democratic leaders are pressing ahead on President Joe Biden\u2019s  big domestic policy bill, with the House expected to vote later this week and the Senate vowing to follow by Christmas in hopes of boosting the party\u2019s standing and delivering on a main campaign promise.House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer on Tuesday outlined a potential voting schedule on Biden\u2019s $1.85 trillion social services and climate change package, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said his chamber would vote next.The president himself, speaking on the road in New Hampshire, predicted quick action after what has been sputtering weeks of delays and sagging poll numbers.\u201cI\u2019m confident the House is gonna pass this bill. And when it passes, it\u2019ll go to the Senate. I think we\u2019ll get it passed within a week,\u201d Biden said at an event in Woodstock touting the related infrastructure bill he just signed into law.Shaking off party differences, the Democrats appear to be ready to spring into action, buoyed by the seeming popularity of the smaller $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package but also the flashing warning signs of a potentially dismal election year ahead.House Democrats huddled privately at the campaign headquarters Tuesday and emerged determined to hold as many as 1,000 public events by the end of the year, joining the White House in taking their agenda on the road to show voters what they hope to accomplish by passing Biden\u2019s bigger package of health care, child care and climate change programs.The Democratic leaders downplayed what has been weeks of party squabbling between progressive and centrist lawmakers that spilled over into start-and-stop progress over the shape of the bill. The 2,135-page package is now coming into focus, with final  assessments from the Congressional Budget Office expected later this week, paving the way for House votes.\u201cThe process can be messy,\u201d said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the caucus chairman. \u201cBut the outcome in passing the \u2018Build Back Better Act\u2019 is going to be so transformational to the American people.\u201dFinishing up work on Biden\u2019s big package would be a tall order in Congress. Differences still run strong in the Senate, where one key conservative Democrat, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, remains his party\u2019s main obstacle \u2014 almost single-handedly preventing the president from delivering on his main campaign promise.Even if the House is able to vote later this week, the schedule is getting crowded. The House and Senate are staring down a year-end pileup of must-pass legislation, including measures needed to fund the government and allow continued borrowing to pay its bills.But Schumer was insistent Tuesday that once the House clears the Biden bill, which is expected before lawmakers leave for the Thanksgiving holiday, the Senate would get it done in December.\u201c\u2018Build Back Better\u2019 is very important to America, we believe it\u2019s very popular with Americans, we aim to pass it before Christmas,\u201d Schumer said.Lawmakers appear eager to reshape the debate, hitting the road to impress on voters what the Biden package means to Americans in communities across the nation \u2014 from savings on child care and health care to new jobs that could come from the climate change and other infrastructure investments.Election losses in Virginia earlier this month, alongside a close call for the party in New Jersey, affirmed what is shaping up to be a poor outlook ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections, when the Democrats\u2019 narrow hold on the House and Senate is at risk.Republicans are refusing to support Biden\u2019s larger bill, leaving Democrats to pass it on their own with just a few votes to spare in the House and none in the evenly-split 50-50 Senate.On Tuesday, Republican leaders warned that unleashing more federal government spending would worsen inflation, which has been hitting American households with higher prices for some goods  as consumers are spending freely and demand soars.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Biden\u2019s bill \u201cwill only exacerbate, only make worse, inflation.\u201dBut for Democrats, doing nothing appears to be a worse political option. They believe the increased government support for child care, health care and home health services will help American families adjust to an economy that has shifted during the COVID-19 crisis.Prospects for passing Biden\u2019s bill in the House have been close before, only to be dashed amid party infighting as progressives pushed for action but more conservative Democrats hit the brakes. The debate had tied the bill to the slimmer infrastructure measure, but now that Biden has signed that bill into law, the focus is back on his bigger bill.Key House centrists have been waiting on fiscal analysis from Congressional Budget Office, which has been doling out a section-by-section nonpartisan assessment of the legislation\u2019s expected costs and potential impact on deficits. The CBO said it expects to deliver its final reports by the end of the week.Hoyer said the House could vote as soon as Thursday, though it could shift to Friday or Saturday.\u201cI think if we get the information as expected, I don\u2019t see why we couldn\u2019t proceed this week,\u201d said Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., a leader of a centrist caucus of lawmakers.___Associated Press writers Farnoush Amiri, Alan Fram and Alexandra Jaffe contributed to this report.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostThe Wyoming Republican Party voted to no longer recognize Rep. Liz Cheney as a member of the GOP this weekend, a symbolic move that reflects ongoing frustration among conservatives who are still firmly allied with former President Donald Trump.The party passed the measure by a 31-29 vote on Saturday, the Casper Star Tribune reported. The move comes after about a third of Wyoming counties voted earlier this year to no longer recognize Cheney as a Republican. The state\u2019s GOP also voted in February to censure her over a vote to impeach Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\u201cTo further her own personal political agenda, Representative Liz Cheney has not only caused massive disruption, distraction and division within the House Republican Conference, but has also willingly, happily, and energetically joined forces with and proudly pledged allegiance to democrat Speaker of the House Pelosi,\u201d the resolution reads. The measure adds that Cheney did so \u201cas a means of serving her own personal interests while ignoring the interests, needs and expectations of Wyoming Republicans.\u201dCheney\u2019s spokesperson told The Associated Press that the idea she isn\u2019t a conservative Republican is \u201claughable.\u201d \u201cShe is bound by her oath to the Constitution,\u201d the spokesperson, Jeremy Adler, told the publication. \u201cSadly a portion of the Wyoming GOP leadership has abandoned that fundamental principle and instead allowed themselves to be held hostage to the lies of a dangerous and irrational man.\u201d The congresswoman is running for reelection next year and faces at least four Republican opponents, including attorney Harriet Hageman, whom Trump has endorsed. Hageman told the Casper Star Tribune that the Wyoming GOP\u2019s vote was fitting, saying Cheney had completely broken \u201cwith where we are as a state.\u201dCheney has drawn the ire of many in her party for her repeated criticism of Trump and her fellow Republicans\u2019 failure to hold him accountable for his role in the Jan. 6 riot, which was intended to overturn his 2020 election loss.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Politics Reporter, HuffPostVermont Sen. Patrick Leahy said Monday that he will not run for reelection to a ninth term in 2022, the latest major Democratic retirement ahead of next year\u2019s midterms.\u201cI\u2019ve reached the conclusion that it\u2019s time to put down the gavel. It is time to pass the torch to the next Vermonter ... it\u2019s time to come home,\u201d Leahy said at a press conference in Montpelier after recounting his legislative accomplishments during his 47 years in office.The Democratic lawmaker was first elected to the Senate in 1974, following the Watergate hearings and the Richard Nixon administration. Most recently he served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Appropriations Committee, helping enact scores of bills into law and broker several major deals to fund the government.Democratic Rep. Peter Welch, 74, the state\u2019s lone congressional representative, is considered a possible candidate for Leahy\u2019s seat, as is Vermont Senate President Pro Tem Becca Balint (D) and state Sen. Kesha Ram-Hinsdale (D). Vermont is the only state never to send a woman to Congress.Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a moderate Republican, has said he won\u2019t run. National Republicans are expected to lobby Scott and change his mind. As president pro tempore of the Senate, Leahy is constitutionally the second-highest-ranking Senate official after Vice President Kamala Harris, and third in the line of presidential succession behind Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. If Democrats manage to retain control of the Senate next year, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein would be next in line to serve as president pro tempore of the Senate.Leahy was briefly hospitalized earlier this year after he began \u201cnot feeling well\u201d in his Capitol office. He was sent to the hospital for an evaluation just hours after being sworn in to preside over the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump. The health scare prompted anxiety among his Democratic colleagues. Democrats currently control the chamber by a narrow 50-50 majority, with Harris casting tie-breaking votes as needed. They\u2019ll need all 50 Democrats in order to pass President Joe Biden\u2019s social spending and climate package, the Build Back Better Act, as well to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, should one arise.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s a hidden crisis that has existed for years inside one of the most well-funded institutions on the planet and has only worsened during the coronavirus pandemic. As many as 160,000 active-duty military members are having trouble feeding their families.That estimate by Feeding America, which coordinates the work of more than 200 food banks around the country, underscores how long-term food insecurity has extended into every aspect of American life, including the military.The exact scope of the problem is a topic of debate, due to a lack of formal study. But activists say it has existed for years and primarily affects junior-level enlisted service members \u2014 ranks E1 to E4 in military parlance \u2014 with children.\u201cIt\u2019s a shocking truth that\u2019s known to many food banks across the United States,\u201d said Vince Hall, Feeding America\u2019s government relations officer. \u201cThis should be the cause of deep embarrassment.\u201dThe group estimates that 29% of troops in the most junior enlisted ranks faced food insecurity during the previous year.\u201cIt is what it is,\u201d said James Bohannon, 34, a Naval E4 (petty officer third class) in San Diego who relies on food assistance to keep his two daughters fed.\u201cYou know what you\u2019re signing up for in the military,\u201d he said, after emerging from a drive-thru food distribution organized by the local Armed Services YMCA branch. \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to lie. It\u2019s really tough.\u201dIn addition to modest pay for junior enlisted ranks, the frequent moves inherent to military life make it difficult for military spouses to find steady work. Also, the internal military culture of self-sufficiency leaves many reluctant to speak about their difficulties, for fear they will be regarded as irresponsible.The problem is exacerbated by an obscure Agriculture Department rule that prevents thousands of needy military families from accessing the SNAP government assistance program, commonly known as food stamps.\u201cIt\u2019s one of these things that the American people don\u2019t know about, but it\u2019s a matter of course among military members. We know this,\u201d said Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat and former Blackhawk pilot who lost both legs in a helicopter crash in Iraq. \u201cWe\u2019re the mightiest military on the face of the earth and yet those who are on the lower rung of our military ranks are \u2015 if they are married and have a child or two\u2015 they\u2019re hungry. How can you focus on carrying out the mission and defending our democracy. If you\u2019re worried about whether or not your kid gets dinner tonight?\u201dMeredith Knopp, CEO of a food bank in St. Louis and an Army veteran, said the problem cuts across all branches of the military. She recalls being a young officer in Texas when she was approached by a new private with a baby.\u201cThey were getting ready to turn off his electricity because he couldn\u2019t pay his bills,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was shocking to me.\u201dPerhaps the best indication of how entrenched the problem has become is that a robust network of military-adjacent charitable organizations such as the Armed Services YMCA and Blue Star Families has developed an infrastructure of food banks near most major domestic bases.San Diego may be one of the epicenters of the phenomenon, with high housing costs and multiple military bases within driving distance. For Brooklyn Pittman, whose husband, Matthew, is in the Navy, the move to California from West Virginia this year was a financial shock.\u201cWe had a nice savings built up and then we moved out here and it was rough,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still had student loans and everything on top of everything else.\u201dTheir savings quickly disappeared and the small income she earns from dog-sitting didn\u2019t come close to covering the shortfall. For a while, the couple considered sleeping in their car on the base grounds until the next paycheck.Pittman was one of 320 families participating in the Armed Services YMCA\u2019s late October drive-thru food distribution. The organization had been hosting events like this for more than 10 years, but when the pandemic struck, expanded operations from six sites to 11 around the country and doubled the frequency of the San Diego-area events.There\u2019s a diversity of opinion as to how much of a stigma the issue carries within military communities.Kelly Klor, who works on food insecurity issues for Blue Star Families, recalls a period of financial hardship 13 years ago as a young mother in Texas whose husband had just enlisted. The family pinched pennies at every opportunity, never eating out and relying on the local public library for entertainment. But they still depended on WIC \u2014 a similar program to food stamps that serves mothers and children \u2014 in order to afford expensive baby formula for her infant daughter.\u201cI felt embarrassed pulling out my vouchers,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the same time, I was thinking \u2018Should it be this hard?\u2019 \u201dKlor recalls treating her financial trouble as a taboo subject, even through she suspected many families around her were in the same situation.\u201cIt seemed like it wasn\u2019t something that you share with other people,\u201d she said.But Maggie Meza, a Blue Star Families representative in San Diego, recalls the communal poverty as common knowledge and a bonding element among families.\u201cIt was like \u2018Your husband\u2019s a sergeant, my husband\u2019s a sergeant. We\u2019re both broke. Let\u2019s go find some free stuff,\u2019 \u201d she said.One of the strangest aspects of the problem is a mysterious Agriculture Department regulation that prevents thousands of needy military families from receiving food stamps. Families living outside the base grounds receive a Basic Allowance for Housing to help cover most of their costs.But the 2008 Food and Nutrition Act dictates that the allowance counts as income in calculating eligibility to receive SNAP benefits, and that ends up disqualifying thousands of military families. The allowance doesn\u2019t count as income for tax reasons or for WIC benefits.Food security activists say they\u2019re confused by both the original rule and the fact that it has endured for more than 12 years.\u201cNo one seems to know why it\u2019s still a law,\u201d said Hall, the Feeding America official.Dorene Ocamb, chief development officer for the Armed Services YMCA, speculated that the regulation is \u201cjust a case of unintended consequences.\u201dAdded Sen. Duckworth: \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell you where it comes from. I can only tell you that they won\u2019t change it.\u201dA spokesman for the USDA said in an email reply that the department is \u201ctaking a fresh look at our authorities with respect to this policy.\u201dThe issue is more than just a humanitarian problem. It directly impacts national security, said Josh Protas, vice president of public policy for MAZON, an organization that has done extensive research on military hunger.Armed forces members enduring food insecurity are more likely to be distracted in the field and less likely to re-enlist, he said. That talent loss may be generational because military service tends to run in families.\u201cWe\u2019re doing a disservice to future recruitment efforts,\u201d Protas said. \u201cWe could be losing good people because they can\u2019t support their families.\u201dSeveral people involved in the issue criticized the Pentagon for turning a blind eye to the problem.\u201cThe denial by the Pentagon has been frustrating,\u201d Protas said. \u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing for our leaders to acknowledge the problem.\u201dColleen Heflin, a professor of public administration at Syracuse University, said the lack of Pentagon interest has led to a critical shortage of proper study or data. \u201cIn my experiences, it\u2019s hard to explain this to Department of Defense officials,\u201d she said. \u201cThey find it embarrassing and something they would not like to acknowledge.\u201dBut Ocamb pushes back against the criticism that the military is burying the issue.She acknowledges that there are \u201csome optics that people are trying to work around\u201d but says most base commanders welcome the assistance and points out that the Navy literally owns the San Diego property where the ASYMCA food distributions take place.\u201cI think the military knows this is a complex issue and they rely on partners like us,\u201d she said. \u201cThis concept that the military wants to sweep this under the rug \u2026 then why do they let us keep doing this on Navy-owned ground?\u201dSome of those who had complained about Pentagon reluctance to face the issue say the attitude has changed in recent months under the administration of President Joe Biden.Shannon Razsadin, president of the Military Family Advisory Network, says she has felt a change in attitude from the Pentagon this year, and partially credits first lady Jill Biden for publicly championing the issue.\u201cThey are focused on understanding it in the Pentagon,\u201d she said. \u201cSix months ago, I wouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201dEfforts to secure Pentagon comment on this issue were unsuccessful. But a Pentagon official told The Associated Press that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin would be publicly speaking on the subject in the near future.There are fresh attempts by Congress to tackle the problem. Duckworth has sponsored a bill that would establish a Basic Needs Allowance payment for military families in need. Rep. James McGovern, D-Mass., has appealed for a serious Pentagon study of the problem and a repeal of the USDA\u2019s Basic Allowance for Housing regulation.\u201cAt this stage, there\u2019s no excuse for anyone in the top echelons of the Pentagon to say they don\u2019t know this is a problem,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science. This is solvable ... somebody take responsibility and solve it.\u201d\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) \u2014 Pyrotechnics, elaborate costumes and aerial acrobatics ruled the night at the 2021 MTV European Music Awards show in Hungary\u2019s capital Sunday, a ceremony that was both a celebration of the year\u2019s biggest musical artists and a statement of support for LGBTQ people in the event\u2019s host country.The show at the Papp Laszlo Sportarena in Budapest, which aired live on MTV in 180 countries, featured performances by some of the world\u2019s most popular artists \u2014 some of them LGBTQ musicians that used their stage time to speak out against policies in Hungary that are widely seen as curtailing LGBTQ rights.Opening the night was English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran with a performance of his newly released song \u201cOverpass Graffiti.\u201d Then the show\u2019s host, American rapper Saweetie, descended onto the stage riding a giant snowflake for her own medley of songs.Saweetie, after speaking out on the need to show \u201crespect for the LGBTQ community,\u201d presented Sheeran with the award for best artist.Later, Sheeran\u2019s hit song \u201cBad Habits,\u201d a chart-topping single from his fifth studio album released this year, took the award for best song, and the British singer performed his hit \u201cShivers.\u201dAmerican rapper Lil Nas X was got the best video prize for \u201cMONTERO (Call Me By Your Name),\u201d a video the artist co-directed with Ukrainian music video director Tanu Muino. The rapper accepted the award via video message.The win by Lil Nas X, who came out as gay in 2019, highlighted the rift in values between the MTV EMAs and Hungary\u2019s right-wing government, which came under heavy backlash during the summer when it passed a law forbidding the promotion or depiction of homosexuality to minors.When announcing in October that the awards show would be held in Budapest, the president and CEO of MTV Entertainment Group Worldwide, Chris McCarthy, said the ceremony would be an opportunity to make a stand for gay and transgender civil rights worldwide in the Central European nation that has moved to curtail them.\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to using the event to amplify our voices and stand in solidarity with our LGBTQ siblings,\u201d McCarthy said in an interview with The Associated Press, adding that no censorship of the telecast would be tolerated.Another expression of that solidarity came through the EMAs debut of German musician Kim Petras, the first transgender artist in the awards\u2019 history to perform at the show.Earlier this month, Petras expressed support for MTV\u2019s decision to hold the awards in Hungary, which she said she hoped would inspire the local LGBTQ community to \u201cnot give up on themselves.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m transgender and performing at the EMAs,\u201d Petras said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be pretty powerful to be in Hungary and perform the show when these laws have just happened.\u201dIn an interview with the AP from the red carpet on Sunday, Petras said \u201ccensorship of any kind of love sucks. It\u2019s not good. No one should feel, you know, not represented in media. No one should feel like it\u2019s not okay to be who they are.\u201dAlso performing at the EMAs was Norwegian indie pop act girl in red, with her hit single \u201cSerotonin.\u201d English singer-songwriter Griff gave a debut performance of her song \u201cOne Night,\u201d while American pop-rock group One Republic performed the previous night at the MTV World Stage on Budapest\u2019s Heroes\u2019 Square.Taking the best rock award was Italian band and first-time EMA performers Maneskin, who took the stage amid flying sparks and a giant neon sign beaming the name of their song \u201cMAMMAMIA.\u201dSouth Korean pop group BTS took the most awards with four \u2014 best pop, best K-pop, best group and biggest fans \u2014 while host and performer Saweetie won in the \u201cbest new\u201d category.Taking the best alternative award was English multi-instrumentalist and singer YUNGBLUD, who closed the night with his newest single, \u201cfleabag.\u201d Columns of fire erupted during the performance, and a smashed guitar and overturned amplifiers were all that were left once YUNGBLUD left the stage.During the show, the EMAs recognized the winners of the \u201cGeneration Change Award,\u201d a new category honoring five activists fighting against anti-LGBTQ policies worldwide.Actress and talk show host Drew Barrymore honored the winners through a video message, saying they are doing \u201cincredible things for the LGBTQ+ community.\u201d\u201cI am proud to help elevate these young voices. They are all gravely asking to love who they want and to love who they are,\u201d Barrymore said.The winners were LGBTQ activists from Iraq, Nigeria, Brazil, the United States and Hungary. Accepting the Generation Change Award in person was Hungarian activist Viktoria Radvanyi, an organizer with Budapest Pride.Radvanyi dedicated the award to Hungary\u2019s LGBTQ community and urged them to \u201cget out and vote together\u201d in Hungarian elections scheduled for April, where Hungary\u2019s right-wing governing party faces its most serious challenge since it took power in 2010.\u201cNever accept the notion that you should tolerate violence and discrimination,\u201d Radvanyi said. \u201cEvery single human being is born equal, period ...

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Joe Biden and China\u2019s Xi Jinping have slurped noodles together in Beijing. They\u2019ve shared deep thoughts about the meaning of America during an exchange on the Tibetan plateau. They\u2019ve gushed to U.S. business leaders about developing a sincere respect for each other.The American president has held up his relationship with Xi as evidence of his heartfelt belief that good foreign policy starts with building strong personal relationships.But as the two leaders prepare to hold their first presidential meeting on Monday, the troubled U.S.-China relationship is demonstrating that the power of one of Biden\u2019s greatest professed strengths as a politician \u2014 the ability to connect \u2014 has its limits.\u201cWhen it comes to U.S.-China relations, the gaps are so big and the trend lines are so problematic that the personal touch can only go so far,\u201d said Matthew Goodman, who served as an Asia adviser on the National Security Council in the Barack Obama and George W. Bush administrations.White House officials have set low expectations for Monday\u2019s virtual meeting: No major announcements are expected and there\u2019s no plan for the customary joint statement by the two countries at the end, according to administration officials.The public warmth \u2014 Xi referred to Biden as his \u201cold friend\u201d when Biden visited China in 2013 while the then-U.S. vice president spoke of their \u201cfriendship\u201d \u2014 has cooled now that both men are heads of state. Biden bristled in June when asked by a reporter if he would press his old friend to cooperate with a World Health Organization investigation into the coronavirus origins.\u201cLet\u2019s get something straight: We know each other well; we\u2019re not old friends,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s just pure business.\u201dBiden nonetheless believes a face-to-face meeting \u2014 even a virtual one like the two leaders will hold Monday evening \u2014 has its value.\u201cHe feels that the history of their relationship, having spent time with him, allows him to be quite candid as he has been in the past and he will continue to be,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in previewing the encounter.Biden and Xi, ages 78 and 68 respectively, first got to know each other on travels across the U.S. and China when both were vice presidents, interactions that both leaders say left a lasting impression.Of late, there have been signs that there could be at least a partial thawing after the first nine months of the Biden administration were marked by the two sides trading recriminations and by unproductive exchanges between the presidents\u2019 top advisers.Last week, for example, the U.S. and China pledged at U.N. climate talks in Glasgow, Scotland, to increase their cooperation and speed up action to rein in climate-damaging emissions.Monday\u2019s meeting \u2014 the two leaders\u2019 third engagement since Biden became president \u2014 comes amid mounting tensions in the U.S.-China relationship. The two held long phone calls in February and September where they discussed human rights, trade, the pandemic and other issues.Biden has made clear that he sees China as the United States\u2019 greatest national security and economic competitor and has tried to reframe American foreign policy to reflect that belief.His administration has taken Beijing to task over committing human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in northwest China, squelching pro-democracy efforts in Hong Kong and resisting global pressure to cooperate fully with investigations into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.Tensions have also risen as the Chinese military has flown increasing numbers of sorties near the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its territory.Chinese officials have signaled that Taiwan will be a top issue for the talks. Biden has made clear that his administration will abide by the long-standing U.S. \u201cOne China\u201d policy, which recognizes Beijing but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei. Chinese military forces held exercises last week near Taiwan in response to a visit by a U.S. congressional delegation to the island.The president intends, in part, to use the conversation to underscore the need to establish \u201cguardrails\u201d in the relationship to ensure that the two sides in the midst of their stiff competition avoid \u201cunintended conflict,\u201d according to a senior administration official who briefed reporters on White House planning for the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity.The official said the video call is expected to last \u201cseveral hours,\u201d adding that the White House was hopeful that the two leaders\u2019 seeing each other would allow for greater depth to their conversation than their two earlier calls this year.Other U.S. presidents have held that bonding with a geopolitical adversary can be a good foreign policy strategy. George W. Bush faced ridicule after his first meeting with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin when he claimed that he had \u201clooked the man in the eye\u201d and \u201cwas able to get a sense of his soul.\u201d Bush would go on to host the Russian leader at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, and bring him to his father\u2019s estate in Kennebunkport, Maine, where the 43rd and 41st presidents took the Russian president fishing.Putin ultimately frustrated Bush and the relationship was broken after Russia\u2019s 2008 invasion of its neighbor Georgia.Donald Trump went from disparaging North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un as \u201crocket man\u201d to declaring the two \u201cfell in love\u201d in an exchange of letters as the U.S. president unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Kim to give up the regime\u2019s nuclear weapons program.Biden\u2019s personal approach to foreign policy is in part informed by the fact that he\u2019s been on the international scene for much of the last half-century, author Evan Osnos noted in the biography \u201cJoe Biden: The Life, the Run, and What Matters Now.\u201d\u201cYou can drop him into Kazakhstan or Bahrain, it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 he\u2019s gonna find some Joe Blow that he met 30 years ago who\u2019s now running the place,\u201d Julianne Smith, a Biden adviser, told Osnos.With Beijing set to host the Winter Olympics in February and Xi expected to be approved by Communist Party leaders to serve a third five-year term as president next year \u2014 unprecedented in recent Chinese history \u2014 the Chinese leader may be looking to stabilize the relationship in the near term.Slowing economic growth and a brewing housing crisis also loom large for Beijing. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d interview aired Sunday warned the deepening of Beijing\u2019s problems could \u201chave global consequences.\u201dAt the same time, Biden, who has seen his polling numbers diminish at home amid concerns about the lingering coronavirus pandemic, inflation and supply chain problems, is looking to find a measure of equilibrium on the most consequential foreign policy matter he faces.Biden would have preferred to hold an in-person meeting with Xi, but Xi has not left China since before the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The virtual meeting was proposed after Biden mentioned during a September phone call with the Chinese leader that he would like to be able to see Xi again.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "LONDON (AP) \u2014 Queen Elizabeth II missed out on the Remembrance Sunday service in London to pay tribute to Britain\u2019s war dead because she sprained her back, Buckingham Palace said Sunday.The service is one of the most important events on the 95-year-old monarch\u2019s calendar, and was meant to be her first public appearance after taking a few weeks off to rest under doctor\u2019s orders.British media reported that the back sprain was not believed to be related to the recent medical advice to rest that prompted other cancellations.\u201cThe Queen, having sprained her back, has decided this morning with great regret that she will not be able to attend today\u2019s Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph,\u201d officials said just hours ahead of the ceremony. \u201cHer Majesty is disappointed that she will miss the service.\u201dThe queen spent a night in a London hospital last month after being admitted for medical tests. It was her first such stay in eight years. On Oct. 29, the palace said she had been told by doctors to rest for two weeks and only take on light duties.She canceled plans to attend the U.N. climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, but sent a video message.But officials stressed at the time that \u201cit remains the queen\u2019s firm intention\u201d to be present for the national Remembrance Sunday service. On Thursday, Buckingham Palace said the monarch planned to watch the ceremony at the Cenotaph war memorial in central London from a balcony, as she has for several years.The queen served in World War II as an army driver and mechanic, and is head of Britain\u2019s armed forces. She attaches great importance to Remembrance Sunday, a solemn ceremony to remember the sacrifices made by fallen servicemen and women. The national service, which follows Armistice Day on Nov. 11, is traditionally marked by the wearing of poppies and a national two-minute silence observed at 11 a.m.On Sunday, other royals and politicians led the ceremony in London\u2019s Whitehall, with hundreds of military personnel and veterans lined up around the Cenotaph memorial. It was the first time the event had returned to normal since the pandemic began.After Royal Marine buglers sounded the \u201cThe Last Post,\u201d Prince Charles, 73, laid the first wreath on the queen\u2019s behalf, as he has done since 2017. He was followed by other royals and Prime Minister Boris Johnson.The queen has continued to work from home, doing desk-based duties, during her period of rest. She has spent most of the time at Windsor Castle, west of London, although she made a weekend visit to Sandringham, the royal family\u2019s eastern England estate.She has missed several other events, including the Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall on Saturday. Officials also said she will miss the opening of the Church of England\u2019s governing General Synod on Tuesday.Penny Junor, a royal biographer, said the queen may be entering a new phase of her reign where she will not be seen as much in public.\u201cIt\u2019s very sad for the queen, because this is the one event in the year that she really, really likes to be at,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re so used to seeing her out and about and looking years younger than she is that I think we\u2019ve been lulled into thinking she can go on at this kind of pace forever.

The film, directed by Oscar-winner Chlo\u00e9 Zhao and starring Angelina Jolie, Kumail Nanjiani and Gemma Chan, fell 61% from its debut. Though not uncommon for a big superhero tentpole, it was significantly steeper than the 52% drop seen by the last Disney and Marvel offering, \u201cShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.\u201dBoth played exclusively in theaters, but the main difference is that \u201cShang-Chi\u201d simply got better ratings from audiences and critics. \u201cShang-Chi\u201d also became available to stream on Disney+ this weekend. \u201cEternals\u201d has made $281.4 million globally to date.Second place went to \u201cClifford the Big Red Dog,\u201d which opened in theaters during the week and was also available to stream at home for Paramount+ subscribers. It made an estimated $16.4 million from 3,700 theaters over the weekend and $22 million across its five days in release.Though critics were not impressed (it has a 48% on Rotten Tomatoes), audiences were more favorable, giving it a promising A CinemaScore. And \u201cClifford\u201d managed to do this in the face of uncertain moviegoing conditions for families.Blockbusters rounded out the top five with \u201cDune\u201d in third place with $5.5 million, \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d in fourth with $4.6 million and \u201cVenom: Let There Be Carnage\u201d in fifth with $4 million.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 When the shooter in the 2018 Parkland school massacre finally pleaded guilty last month, it briefly revived attention and donations for the anti-gun violence March For Our Lives student movement birthed by the tragedy.It also dredged up personal trauma for many of young activists, though most are now hundreds of miles away at college.Jaclyn Corin, 21, one of the group\u2019s original organizers and now a Harvard junior, stayed off social media the week of the shooter\u2019s court proceedings to avoid painful memories. But well-intentioned loved ones texted constantly to provide support, unwittingly making it impossible for her to ignore.\u201cI try my best not to think about him and the violence that he inflicted, but it\u2019s incredibly hard to do that when someone who ruined your life and the lives of literally everyone in your community is trending on social media.\u201dIn the initial months after the shooting that killed 17 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, the teenagers amassed one of the largest youth protests in history in Washington and rallied more than a million activists in sister marches from California to Japan. They made the cover of Time magazine and raised millions to fund March For Our Lives. They testified before Congress, met with the president, won the International Children\u2019s Peace Prize and launched a 60-plus city bus tour to register tens of thousands of young voters.March For Our Lives has evolved into a 300-chapter organization that has had a hand in helping pass many of the 130 gun violence prevention bills approved across the country since 2018 and regularly files amicus briefs in gun-related lawsuits.Yet some of the original founders, including Emma Gonzalez, have left or taken a step back \u2014 or moved on to other issues. One of them is running for Congress in Florida.Corin was so burned out from activism when she started college that she said she needed a year for herself.\u201cA lot of our trauma from the shooting is inherently linked to the organization,\u201d she said.Nearly four years after the shootings, the twenty-somethings have managed to keep the organization going and youth-led. Still, they\u2019ve struggled to achieve sustainable financing. The organization has raised over $31 million to date, but its operating costs were slightly higher than funds in 2020.David Hogg, one of the most recognizable faces from the group and still one of its most active members, said the organization is much more stable now than in the early days\u201cWhen you get a bunch of traumatized teenagers together and say, \u2018It\u2019s up to you to fix this,\u2019 ... the weight that puts on a 17-year-old mind or a 14-year-old mind like my sister\u2019s after she lost four friends that day is enormous.\u201dHogg, also a student at Harvard, delayed college for a year to help grow the organization. He was in Washington last week for a Supreme Court case about the right to carry a firearm in public for self-defense where the organization filed an amicus brief supporting a restrictive New York state law.\u201cThere are days when I want to stop. There are days when I am exhausted. But there are days when I realize I am not alone in this work,\u201d Hogg said in a recent interview.Hogg, who has drawn persistent scorn from conservatives including Georgia\u2019s Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Fox News personality Laura Ingraham, said March For Our Lives is focused on the long game. It hopes to spur youth nationally to run for office, become judges and draft policies.Volunteers in the organization made over 1 million texts and phone calls leading up to the 2020 election.Maxwell Frost, one of the group\u2019s founders and its former organizing director, is running for an open congressional seat from Orlando. Another founding member, Charlie Mirsky, took a year off to work full time as the organization\u2019s policy director before before enrolling at Lafayette College. Last summer, he helped the organization form a judicial advocacy branch to write amicus briefs.While gun control remains the group\u2019s chief mission, the students said they consider issues like racism, poverty and voter disenfranchisement to be intertwined and have focused extra efforts on communities of color affected by gun violence.Many of the students rallied for Black Lives Matters last summer in the wake of the George Floyd protests, including Aalayah Eastmond.Eastmond, now a junior at Trinity Washington University, was in her Holocaust history class when the gunman killed several students inside. The now 20-year-old took part in March For Our Lives\u2019 bus tour, though she is not a formal member of the group.\u201cI wanted to make sure we were addressing inner city gun violence that disproportionately impacts Black and brown youth,\u201d Eastmond said. \u201cI felt like that was a huge part of the conversation that is overlooked.\u201dAnd now, as a jury will decide in January whether the Parkland school shooter will spend life in prison or receive the death penalty, the student activists find themselves grappling yet again with the human toll of gun violence. The organization does not have a formal position, but the students said they support whatever the victims\u2019 families want.\u201cI think it\u2019s a really difficult scenario,\u201d Corin said. \u201cI struggle with the morality of the death penalty often, but I do know that it could give victims\u2019 families peace, specifically in this case where we know the person is guilty.\u201d\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Twenty years ago, a Green Party activist running for the Phoenix City Council named Kyrsten Sinema likened raising campaign cash to \u201cbribery.\u201dNow a first-term senator from Arizona, she no longer has such qualms.Once a self-styled \u201cPrada socialist\u201d labeled as \u201ctoo extreme\u201d by Arizona\u2019s Democratic Party, Sinema has found new power as a centrist in a 50-50 Senate where there are no votes to spare, forcing President Joe Biden to downsize his agenda and other Democratic ambitions.Her outsize authority highlights one senator\u2019s ability to exploit her party\u2019s narrow hold on the chamber and bend the will of the majority. That prowess is also a reason that corporate interests eager to influence Democrats\u2019 now-$1.85 trillion package of social and climate initiatives have rushed to provide her financial support.Throughout months of exhaustive negotiations, Sinema has offered only limited explanation for opposing policies Democrats have campaigned on for years, angering many of her colleagues.But her actions also have won her new allies, making Sinema a magnet for campaign donations from powerful interests with millions at stake in how the legislation turns out.Sinema notably opposed two parts of Biden\u2019s initial proposal that have broad public support: an increase in the tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals, and an expansive plan that would have substantially reduced the cost of prescription drugs for Medicare recipients.The concessions she helped win align with the interests of many of her donors who have made Sinema the Senate\u2019s No. 3 recipient of money \u2014 nearly $500,000 \u2014 this year from the pharmaceutical and financial services sectors, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics.Sinema\u2019s office declined to make her available for an interview. In a statement, her office said she has consistently supported \u201cpro-growth economic policies\u201d and \u201cprotecting medical innovation.\u201d They disputed the relevance of comments Sinema made early in her political career in a race she lost.\u201cSenator Sinema makes decisions based on one consideration: what\u2019s best for Arizona,\u201d spokesman John LaBombard said.Yet her embrace of influential donors she once rejected perplexes many in her party.\u201cIt creates the perception of a conflict of interest and perception of industry groups having influence,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who was co-chair of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cHow does she explain the role of all of these contributions?\u201dA former social worker who served on Ralph Nader\u2019s 2000 Green Party presidential campaign, Sinema didn\u2019t seek office as a Democrat until after two unsuccessful Arizona bids as a progressive or independent.After winning a seats in the Arizona House in 2004, her political persona began to shift. Gradually retooling herself as a moderate, Sinema rose through the Legislature\u2019s Democratic minority while positioning herself for higher office as the state transitioned from a Republican stronghold to an electoral battleground.Since her 2012 election to the U.S. House, the candidate who once railed against capitalism\u2019s \u201cAlmighty Dollar\u201d has welcomed the contributions of industry groups and corporate political action committees. She\u2019s raised at least $3 million from CEOs, businesses executives, investors, lobbyists and finance sector workers, campaign finance records show.Sinema\u2019s swelling campaign account comes as many in her party have refused such contributions, denouncing them as evidence of deep-seated corruption in Washington.While Sinema is hardly alone in raising money from special interests during a major legislative battle, what is notable is the scope of Sinema\u2019s fundraising windfall between April and September. Her objections to Biden\u2019s legislation then gave her massive sway over the future of his bill. The roughly $3 million she collected during that period is the best cash haul of her career outside the 2018 election, when she was first on the ballot for U.S. Senate.But there were signs of her gravitating to business interests earlier.Last year, she helped initiate a bipartisan caucus to raise \u201cawareness of the benefits of personalized medicine,\u201d a pricey form of precision treatments for diseases that are hard to cure. Her current opposition to tax increases on corporate and high-earners comes after she voted in 2017 against President Donald Trump\u2019s tax cut legislation, which lowered the corporate rate to its current 21 percent while also giving a rebate to high earners.Among the donors:\u2014Executives and a PAC for the drugmaker Amgen have given at least $21,500 in 2021, making Sinema second only to House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy of California in receiving contributions from the company this year. Almost all of the Amgen donations were clustered in late June, when Democrats were pushing legislation that would have curtailed pharmaceutical company earnings by allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices. Sinema\u2019s opposition was instrumental in leading lawmakers to pursue a scaled-back version that is now advancing in the House. The new plan would allow Medicare to negotiate the price of about 100 drug within a few years, while limiting monthly insulin copayments to $35 for many.Company CEO Robert Bradway gave Sinema $5,000; two company lobbyists gave an additional $3,000.\u2014Sinema has taken in at least $27,000 this year from major drugmakers including Takeda, GlaxoSmithKline, Genentech and Eli Lilly. Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the preeminent trade organization representing drugmakers, has been a major source of funding for a group that is running ads praising Sinema as \u201cindependent and effective for Arizona,\u201d records show.\u2014Twelve executives for the investment bank Goldman Sachs have donated $37,000 to Sinema since May. That includes Goldman President John Waldron, who gave a maximum $5,800 donation in August. Sinema\u2019s office said that while she doesn\u2019t support raising corporate taxes, she does support establishing a corporate minimum tax so that businesses can\u2019t altogether avoid paying their fair share, which is now included in Biden\u2019s plan.\u2014Executives, managers and a corporate PAC for Ryan LLC, a global tax consulting firm, poured over $72,000 into Sinema\u2019s campaign account in late August and September. That made Ryan, whose employees and PAC had not previously given to Sinema, one of her top corporate donors. The Texas-based company advertises itself as \u201cliberating our clients from the burden of being overtaxed.\u201d In August, USA Today reported that the company officials are ensnared in an FBI inquiry over whether they pressured the administration of Gov. Doug Ducey, R-Ariz., to issue millions of dollars in tax refunds to a Ryan client.Checks have also come in from Jimmy Haslam III, a longtime Republican donor and owner of the Cleveland Browns, and his wife, Susan, who gave $8,700 to Sinema in June and September; Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, twins who run a private equity firm and are perhaps best known for successfully suing Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who each gave $5,800 apiece in July; and Stanley Hubbard, a billionaire Minnesota TV and radio station mogul who has given millions of dollars to GOP causes, who donated $2,900 in September.Sinema has drawn the ire of her colleagues in Congress, who say she blocked proposals that almost all Democratic lawmakers support.\u201cIt would be a tragedy for us to not fix the unjust corporate tax system so that corporations and individuals pay their fair share,\u201d said Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, who played an major role in negotiating the bill.Sanders focused on Sinema\u2019s support for the priorities of the pharmaceutical industry.\u201cIt is beyond comprehension that there\u2019s any member of the United States Congress who is not prepared to vote to make sure that we lower prescription drug costs,\u201d he said last month. He added that he hoped Sinema \u201cdoes what the people in Arizona want.\u201dSome longtime Democratic Party financiers have also grown frustrated with her.\u201cWith all the tension in the party, people have long memories,\u201d said Michael Smith, a donor from Los Angeles, whose partner, James Costos, served as President Barack Obama\u2019s ambassador to Spain.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The key question politically is how close the measure comes to paying for itself with savings, like President Joe Biden and top Democrats claim it does.Here\u2019s a guide to understanding the numbers blizzard that CBO is about to unleash:A BIG DEAL FOR MODERATESAfter months of backbiting and bargaining among Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer are confronting the same stubborn problem. Facing unbroken Republican opposition, Democrats can lose no votes in the Senate and just three in the House to pass their mammoth bill.That gives Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and his moderate House counterparts significant leverage. Among other things, the centrists want the measure\u2019s savings \u2014 chiefly tax increases on wealthy people, big corporations and companies doing business abroad \u2014 to fully pay for its family services, health care and environment programs.Five moderates blocked the House from voting on it last week. They demanded to first see CBO\u2019s official estimate of the bill, mainly to see if the agency thinks it would worsen already huge federal deficits. Many centrists are from districts where accusing Democrats of aggravating budget shortfalls is easy fodder for GOP campaign attacks.In a compromise with progressives, the centrists said they\u2019d vote for the bill if CBO figures are \u201cconsistent\u201d with preliminary White House estimates asserting that the measure paid for itself. They promised to try resolving \u201cdiscrepancies\u201d if CBO\u2019s numbers were worse.Pelosi, D-Calif., hopes to finally push the measure through her chamber next week. The Senate is certain to change the bill and its work will take longer.WILL CBO\u2019S NUMBERS HELP DEMOCRATS?Maybe, eventually.The budget office has released estimates on pieces of the 2,100-page legislation. It has promised overall figures \u201cas soon as practicable, but the exact timing is uncertain.\u201dThat means a complete score on the bill may not be ready next week.If that\u2019s the case, would House moderates accept partial CBO numbers or cost estimates from another source? Demand fresh assurances from Biden and Pelosi? Insist on changing the bill, or delaying it again?That\u2019s unclear. Concerns about worsening inflation may only intensify moderates\u2019 qualms.In a reassuring report for Democrats, Congress\u2019 Joint Committee on Taxation, which works with CBO and produces nonpartisan estimates about tax legislation, said last week the measure would raise $1.5 trillion in new revenue over the next decade. That alone would cover most of the legislation\u2019s cost.Yet there\u2019s another complication.DUELING NUMBERSUnlike the White House\u2019s early estimate, CBO\u2019s score may show the bill isn\u2019t fully paid for. It follows stricter rules for making calculations than the White House, which \u2014 no matter which party holds the presidency \u2014 almost always produces rosier numbers than CBO.For example, the White House estimated that by increasing IRS tax enforcement, mostly aimed at the highest earners, by $80 billion over 10 years, the bill would raise $480 billion in additional revenue.Under guidelines CBO follows, it\u2019s not expected to credit the bill with any savings from tougher tax audits. In any event, the budget office projected in September that giving the IRS $80 billion would yield just $200 billion in additional revenue.BUT REMEMBER, THIS IS CONGRESSEven if CBO\u2019s numbers aren\u2019t great, there\u2019s reason to believe the bill would survive. When lawmakers have reached a political consensus to do something, bad budget numbers seldom upend it.Democrats know that sinking legislation carrying Biden\u2019s top domestic priorities would threaten disaster in next year\u2019s congressional elections. At key moments like that, Congress is renowned for its political and budgetary dexterity.Though CBO\u2019s numbers determine a bill\u2019s official price tag, Democrats could simply talk instead about better figures from the White House or elsewhere to paint a brighter fiscal picture. That\u2019s what Republicans did in 2017 when they claimed their huge tax cut would pay for itself, even though CBO projected it would worsen deficits by well over $1 trillion.If the bill\u2019s savings fall short but Democrats find the political payoff for passage irresistibly strong, they might decide to swallow some red ink and insist the bill would bolster the economy. CBO said the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill, which Biden plans to sign Monday, will increase deficits by $256 billion over the next decade, but almost all Democrats and some Republicans backed it anyway.If needed, Democrats could tweak some of the measure\u2019s tax provisions to raise more revenue. Moderates could try forcing progressives to accept additional spending reductions in a bill that\u2019s already been squeezed down from an earlier $3.5 trillion price tag. That would encounter stiff resistance from progressives who say they\u2019ve compromised enough.AND THEN THERE ARE GIMMICKSThe huge bill has plenty of provisions that help keep its price tag in check.Many of its priorities don\u2019t start immediately or are temporary, even though Democrats hope they\u2019ll eventually be made permanent. Since the cost of legislation is measured over 10 years, that effectively makes those programs seem more affordable.More generous tax credits for children and many low-income workers are extended for just one year. Subsidies for buying private health insurance would last four years, while free universal pre-school and bolstered child care benefits would run for six years. New Medicare hearing benefits would begin in 2023, paid family leave in 2024.The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which advocates fiscal discipline, has estimated that the measure\u2019s overall price tag could exceed $4 trillion if its temporary programs were made permanent.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who voted to convict Donald Trump in his second impeachment trial and has repeatedly bumped heads with the former president, announced Friday that she will run for reelection.Trump, who has focused his political efforts on punishing his political opponents, endorsed a leading opponent of Murkowski in June. Kelly Tshibaka was commissioner of Alaska\u2019s Department of Administration before resigning to run for the Senate. In July, the Alaska Republican State Central Committee endorsed Tshibaka after Murkowski\u2019s impeachment vote.\u201cMy heart is, and always has been, in Alaska, and that\u2019s why I am proud to announce my campaign for reelection to the US Senate in 2022,\u201d Murkowski said in a statement. She emphasized that she has always made Alaska, its industries and its people her top priority.The Murkowski reelection bid will be closely watched nationally as Trump seeks to bring down a senator whose name has a rich political history in the state. Her father, Frank Murkowski, was a former governor and a longtime U.S. senator.Murkowski has been in the U.S. Senate since 2002, when her father selected her to finish his unexpired term after he was elected governor. A Murkowski has represented Alaska in the U.S. Senate since 1981.She has bucked the Republican Party before. Murkowski lost her 2010 GOP primary, but went on to win the general election with a write-in campaign against a conservative Republican candidate.Murkowski, often seen as an independent-minded moderate, was one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump, who was acquitted of the sole charge of incitement of insurrection related to the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. She is the only one of the seven to face reelection this year.Murkowski was censured by the Alaska Republican Party in March for her vote to convict Trump during his second impeachment trial. But the National Republican Senatorial Committee endorsed Murkowski, placing its bet on a resilient incumbent.Tshibaka has tried to take advantage of Trump\u2019s popularity in the state, getting backing from his allies and voicing Trump positions, including promotion of his false theories of voter fraud in the 2020 election.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "DENVER (AP) \u2014 Facing a surge in coronavirus infections that threatens to overwhelm Colorado hospitals, Gov. Jared Polis defied federal guidance on COVID-19 booster shots Thursday by issuing an order allowing all state residents 18 and older to get them.U.S. Food and Drug Administration rules allow booster shots for those 18 and over who are at high risk of exposure to the virus. The FDA also permits boosters for people 65 and older, and adults with special medical conditions. Polis\u2019 order declares all of Colorado at high risk of infection, significantly expanding the number of residents eligible.\u201cBecause disease spread is so significant across Colorado, all Coloradans who are 18 years of age and older are at high risk and qualify for a booster shot,\u201d the Democratic governor said in his order.Requests for comment from the FDA were not immediately returned on Thursday, a federal holiday.But at a White House briefing on Wednesday, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, emphasized the importance of getting boosters to those already eligible under the federal guidelines. She also stressed the importance of vaccinating children ages 5-11.\u201cAs you likely know, FDA is currently looking at the data for expanding boosters to all populations,\u201d Walensky said.Pfizer asked U.S. regulators Tuesday to allow boosters of its COVID-19 vaccine for anyone 18 or older, a step that comes amid concern about increased spread of the coronavirus with holiday travel and gatherings.The Biden administration had originally envisioned boosters for all adults, but FDA scientific advisers in September rejected extra Pfizer doses for everyone. The panel wasn\u2019t convinced that young healthy people needed another dose and instead recommended boosters just for certain groups.People who are fully vaccinated are still strongly protected against hospitalization and death from COVID-19. But immunity against infection can wane over time, and the extra-contagious delta variant is spreading widely. U.S. health authorities want to shore up protection in at-risk people who were vaccinated months ago, though they emphasize that the priority remains getting the unvaccinated their first shots.Polis has emphasized vaccinations as a top tool in fighting the latest surge that officials worry could overwhelm the state\u2019s hospital capacity by the end of the year. He\u2019s also expressed frustration in the past with the federal government\u2019s authorization of vaccines and their distribution.\u201cThe Governor has been disappointed with the overly complex message from the CDC and the FDA on boosters and won\u2019t allow that to harm Coloradans who want the additional protection,\u201d Polis spokesman Conor Cahill said Thursday. \u201cThe Governor is confident that this clarification is well within the guidance of the CDC and FDA.\u201dPolis\u2019 order allows vaccine providers to give booster shots to everyone who received the double-dose Pfizer or Moderna vaccines at least six months ago. People who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which hasn\u2019t proven as effective as its competitors, can get a booster at least two months later. Anyone eligible for a booster doesn\u2019t have to stick with their initial vaccination type and can get a different company\u2019s vaccine.About 62% of Colorado residents are fully vaccinated, putting the Rocky Mountain state above the national average and among the top 15 for states with the highest vaccination rate.Yet Colorado had the seventh-highest COVID-19 diagnosis rate in the country over the last week, with 1 in every 259 people getting the virus, according to John Hopkins University data compiled by The Associated Press. Cases, hospitalizations and deaths have all been on the rise for weeks.About 1,426 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized in Colorado, and State Epidemiologist Dr. Rachel Herlihy said Wednesday the state could hit 2,258 COVID-19 hospitalizations by Jan. 1, a record high for the pandemic.The delta variant surge combined with hospital staffing shortages has left about 720 total beds available in intensive care and acute care units, according to the Colorado Hospital Association. Some 17% of all beds are occupied by those with COVID or suspected of having it, the state health department said.Polis put the number of available hospital beds at 623 in his order, and he has repeatedly emphasized that the unvaccinated \u2014 28% of state residents, according to state data \u2014 account for 80% those hospitalized. Officials said many of the remainder are immunocompromised or older patients more susceptible to the virus.\u201cWith an estimated 1 in 67 Coloradans infected, it is likely that nearly all Coloradans are exposed to COVID-19 where they live or work,\u201d the governor said in his order. \u201cI declare the entire State of Colorado high risk for exposure or transmission of COVID19 and therefore eligible for the safe and highly effective COVID-19 booster shot.\u201dColorado\u2019s seven-day positivity rate \u2014 the percentage of people testing positive for the virus out of all who have been tested \u2014 reached 9.93% as of Wednesday.That means for every 100 people tested over that week, nearly 10 of them tested positive. Last year, the highest seven-day positivity rate was 11.21% as of Nov. 20.More than 700,000 Colorado residents are known to have been infected during the pandemic, and 8,814 people have died.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPostHide your rabbits, folks: a new adaptation of \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d is on the way. Paramount+ on Thursday confirmed that actor Lizzy Caplan had signed on for a \u201cdeep-dive reimagining\u201d of the 1987 psychological thriller, which starred Glenn Close and Michael Douglas. This time, the story will be presented as a series, with a screenplay written by Alexandra Cunningham. Caplan, whose credits include \u201cMean Girls\u201d and \u201cMasters of Sex,\u201d will play Alex Forrest, a woman who becomes obsessed with her married lover, Dan Gallagher, after a brief affair. The character was portrayed by Close in the original. According to Paramount+ Chief Content Officer David Nevins, the new \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d will be \u201cvery contemporary while also honoring the original.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a very timeless appeal to the themes of fidelity and infidelity, why good people make very dumb, problematic choices, and just marriage and family against those themes of fidelity and infidelity,\u201d he told Deadline in an interview. \u201cHow it\u2019s done for today and how it\u2019s turned into a series is interesting, and it\u2019s interesting for Lizzy\u2019s part in particular.\u201dA release date for the series was not announced. Directed by Adrian Lyne, 1987\u2019s \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d received rave reviews and nabbed six Academy Award nominations, including Best Actress for Close. Though Alex remains one of her most iconic roles, Close was famously dissatisfied with the movie\u2019s ending and, in particular, her character\u2019s demise. In recent interviews, the actor suggested that her character be reappraised in the wake of current discourse around mental health. \u201cI did take that script to two different psychiatrists, and neither of them back then even brought up the point that maybe she had mental health issues,\u201d Close told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper last week. \u201cNobody did. It is amazing, because now it\u2019d be the first thing I think that people would talk about, and that\u2019s really good.\u201d Though the new \u201cFatal Attraction\u201d had not yet been announced at the time of the interview, Close went on to suggest that she\u2019d be interested in seeing the story retold from Alex\u2019s point of view. \u201cA lot of her behavior wasn\u2019t explained,\u201d she added.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The last time Congress approved a major renewal of federal highway and other transportation programs, the votes were 359-65 in the House and 83-16 in the Senate. It was backed by nearly every Democrat and robust majorities of Republicans.This year\u2019s $1 trillion infrastructure bill easily cleared the Senate 69-13 with GOP support, but crawled through the House last week by 228-206 with just 13 Republican votes.Those defectors were savaged afterward by former President Donald Trump, hard-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., called them \u201ctraitors\u201d while tweeting their names and office telephone numbers, and one of the 13 says he received a death threat.The votes, six years apart, and the harsh blowback against Republican mavericks illustrate a GOP in which conservative voices have grown louder and more militant, fanned by Trump\u2019s bellicose four years in office.Growing numbers of progressives have made Democrats more liberal too, with both shifts fueling a sharpening of partisanship in Washington.\u201cThis madness has to stop,\u201d said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., an 18-term moderate, who said his offices received dozens of threatening calls following his yes vote. That included one obscenity-laced rant that aides provided in which the caller repeatedly called Upton a \u201ctraitor\u201d and expressed hope that the lawmaker, his family and aides would die.Upton closed his two Michigan offices for a day and reopened them after increasing their security.This year\u2019s bill, triple the size of the 2015 measure, is a keystone of President Joe Biden\u2019s push to create jobs and build out the nation\u2019s roads, water systems, broadband coverage and other projects. A compromise between Senate Democrats and Republicans, it will send money into every state and is the kind of bill that politicians have loved promoting back home for decades. Biden plans to sign it Monday.Democrats say GOP opposition to the bill is indefensible on policy and political grounds.\u201cIt\u2019s a sad statement of how the other party has lost its way,\u201d said Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y., who\u2019s leading the House Democratic political arm into a 2022 campaign in which Republicans have solid chances of capturing congressional control. \u201cIf you want our country to fail so you can say things are bad and win power for yourself, you act like the House Republicans are.\u201dBut for many Republicans, infrastructure projects \u2014 once an issue the two parties would reflexively work together on for mutual and national benefit \u2014 now offer a complex political calculation.\u201cWhen it comes to policy these days, we\u2019re basically divided into two tribes. And you stick with your tribe and you don\u2019t try to help the other tribe,\u201d said Glen Bolger, a GOP pollster and strategist.As president, Trump repeatedly promised his own massive infrastructure plan but never produced one, making the phrase \u201cinfrastructure week\u201d a Washington synonym for \u201cpipe dream.\u201d But he opposes the current package, and his ability to rally his conservative supporters against those who cross him was a factor as GOP lawmakers decided how to vote.Even so, hard-right cries for retaliation against the 13 pro-infrastructure Republicans, largely moderates from the Northeast and Midwest, have prompted their own pushback.\u201cThis notion that we\u2019re going to have people that are on the fringe, in terms of the Marjorie Taylor Greenes of the world and others, imposing some kind of a purity test on substance is lunacy,\u201d said Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. Cheney has been at war with Trump and the party\u2019s far right ever since backing his impeachment early this year.Cheney opposed the bill, saying it contained clean energy and other provisions that would hurt Wyoming. She said the 13 Republicans who backed it are \u201camong some of our very best members\u201d who did it \u201cbecause it was the right thing for their districts.\u201dSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., an unabashed partisan warrior, was among 19 Senate Republicans who voted for the bill in August. McConnell, who doesn\u2019t have to worry about being reelected until 2026, said this week he was \u201cdelighted\u201d the measure was heading to Biden.A day earlier, McConnell had already drawn Trump\u2019s wrath.Trump issued a statement denigrating GOP senators who\u2019d backed the bill for \u201cthinking that helping the Democrats is such a wonderful thing to do.\u201d Those Republicans \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves, in particular Mitch McConnell,\u201d Trump wrote.That was just the tip of the iceberg for the attacks.In an interview, the leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus said GOP lawmakers should consider removing from their posts the 10 of the 13 defectors who are the senior Republican on committees and subcommittees. \u201cI respect their right to vote their districts and their conscience. But that doesn\u2019t mean that they should get the privilege of leading\u201d House Republicans, said Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.At a private Florida dinner Monday to bolster House GOP campaign prospects, Trump said he loves House Republicans but not the 13 who voted for the bill, according to an attendee who described Trump\u2019s remarks on condition of anonymity.Earlier, House GOP leaders tweeted, and then deleted, that \u201cAmericans won\u2019t forget\u201d a vote for the \u201csocialist\u201d infrastructure bill. \u201cTime to name names and hold these fake republicans accountable,\u201d tweeted Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.Before last week\u2019s vote, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d for Republicans to promote backing the infrastructure bill during their campaigns because it is so closely linked to Democrats\u2019 accompanying $1.85 trillion social and climate measure, which the GOP has solidly opposed.Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., who switched parties in 2019, said he supported the infrastructure bill because his state would receive over $20 billion \u201cwe desperately need.\u201d Van Drew, who said he had heard \u201csome cranky things\u201d from some people, scoffed at the notion that the bill would \u201ccatapult the president\u201d politically.\u201cIf Marjorie Taylor Greene wants to be mean to me, that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said of the colleague who labeled him and 12 others traitors. \u201cI love America very much.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostA federal judge said Wednesday that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s ban on mask mandates in schools violates the Americans With Disabilities Act, bringing a major victory to advocates who filed suit over the Republican governor\u2019s aggressive efforts to limit COVID-19 protections.U.S. District Court Judge Lee Yeakel\u2019s ruling will renew school districts\u2019 authority to impose mask mandates amid the spread of the coronavirus, and it bars state Attorney General Ken Paxton from enforcing Abbott\u2019s controversial executive order, which he issued in July.\u201cThe spread of COVID-19 poses an even greater risk for children with special health needs,\u201d Yeakel said Wednesday, according to the Texas Tribune. \u201cChildren with certain underlying conditions who contract COVID-19 are more likely to experience severe acute biological effects and to require admission to a hospital and the hospital\u2019s intensive-care unit.\u201dThe group Disability Rights Texas filed the first federal lawsuit against Abbott\u2019s ban in August, saying the prohibition on mask rules put students with disabilities at risk and denied them access to public education. The group said Wednesday that it was \u201cthrilled\u201d with the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cWe are thankful that school districts can now take the steps necessary to protect these students,\u201d Kym Davis Rogers, an attorney for the group, said in a statement. \u201cNo student should be forced to make the choice of forfeiting their education or risking their health, and now they won\u2019t have to.\u201dThe Washington Post notes that the ruling could have national implications in other states where Republican officials have imposed similar prohibitions on measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. The pandemic is not over, and cases have begun to rise in many states once again ahead of the winter holiday season, prompting renewed concern about the virus. Many more people are vaccinated, however, and millions of younger children are newly eligible for inoculations.Big breaking news! A judge has ruled in our federal mask mandate ban lawsuit that Texas Governor Order 38 violates the ADA. @WinstonLaw #MaskMandates #DisabilityRights #ProtectOurChildren https://t.co/LgaSNFYtQYAbbott has aggressively targeted safety measures embraced by many other states, even amid the spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the virus, moving to ban mask mandates and vaccine requirements. School districts flouted his order, however, and the Texas Supreme Court had allowed them to do so while lawsuits made their way through the system.Paxton said later Wednesday his office was considering \u201call legal avenues to challenge this decision,\u201d saying he \u201cstrongly\u201d disagreed with Yeakel\u2019s ruling.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) \u2014 Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday directed the State Department of Health to stop issuing birth certificates listing a nonbinary option instead of designating a gender, despite a settlement agreement in a civil case in which the agency agreed to do so.The first-term Republican said in his order that his administration never reviewed or approved the settlement agreement, which requires the Oklahoma State Department of Health to amend birth certificates in a manner not permitted under Oklahoma law.\u201cThis order ensures this unauthorized action will be corrected,\u201d Stitt\u2019s order states.The order directs the department to cease amending birth certificates in any way not specifically authorized under state law and to remove from its website any reference to amending birth certificates for nonbinary people. People who are nonbinary do not identify with traditional male or female gender assignments.Stitt also directed the Legislature to pass legislation when it returns next year to specifically prohibit the issuance of birth certificates with nonbinary designations.Freedom Oklahoma, which advocates for nonbinary and LGBTQ people, said in a statement that while the state is facing scrutiny over how it carries out executions, \u201cit felt easy for the governor to try and refocus media narratives and partisan pressure by attacking some of the most marginalized and historically excluded residents of our state.\u201dNichole McAfee, the executive director of Freedom Oklahoma, said the governor does not have the authority to overturn an agreement entered into in a court of law.Stitt\u2019s office declined to comment, with a spokeswoman saying the order speaks for itself.The agency issued a birth certificate in May to Oregon resident Kit Lorelied, who was born in Oklahoma, identifies as nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns.Lorelied sued after the Oklahoma State Department of Health initially refused the request. The department, represented by the Office of the Attorney General, reached a settlement in May in which it agreed to add nonbinary as an option on birth certificates.Stitt and other Republican leaders in the Legislature expressed outrage after learning of the decision last month, and the Commissioner of Health Lance Frye resigned the following day.Lorelied\u2019s attorney, Christopher Brecht of Tulsa, declined to comment on Stitt\u2019s order, noting that the litigation is still an active case.The Health Department issued a statement saying it would work with the governor and the Office of the Attorney General on any orders for amendments to birth certificates that fall outside the scope of current law.The U.S. State Department announced last week it had issued its first passport with an \u201cX\u201d gender designation, marking a milestone in the recognition of the rights of people who do not identify as male or female, and expects to be able to offer the option more broadly next year.Doctors and scientists say sex and gender are not the same thing. While sex typically refers to anatomy, gender identity is more an inner sense of being male, female or somewhere in between, regardless of physical anatomy, according to Dr. Jason Rafferty, a pediatrician and child psychiatrist at Hasbro Children\u2019s Hospital in Rhode Island and a lead author of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 transgender policy.___This story has been updated to correct binary to nonbinary in headline.\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A Florida aquarium will temporarily close to treat its resident prosthetic-tailed dolphin that starred in the \u201cDolphin Tale\u201d movies. The famous marine mammal is now in critical condition from a suspected infection.The Clearwater Marine Aquarium said in a statement it will shut its doors Friday \u201cto create the best possible environment\u201d for medical staff to treat Winter, a 16-year-old female bottlenose dolphin suffering from a gastrointenstinal infection.\u201cThe dedicated CMA animal care experts are consulting with top animal care and veterinary specialists in the country and exploring all possible options to save Winter\u2019s life,\u201d the aquarium statement said.The aquarium plans to reopen Saturday.Winter was two months old when her tail became entangled in a crab trap near Cape Canaveral, which forced its amputation. \u201cDolphin Tale,\u201d which was released in 2011, chronicled Winter\u2019s recovery and the unprecedented, lengthy effort to fit her with a prosthetic tail.The film, starring Harry Connick Jr., Ashley Judd, Kris Kristofferson and Morgan Freeman, was largely filmed at the Clearwater aquarium and surrounding Tampa Bay locations. It put the non-profit aquarium, first opened in 1972 on the site of a former water treatment plant, on the map internationally.Officials there say Winter\u2019s story has become an inspiration for disabled people around the world and the aquarium has received thousands of messages of support since Winter\u2019s illness became known.\u201cMany are inspired by her resiliency and this amazing response reminds us of how deeply she has affected millions, including so many on their own health journey,\u201d the aquarium statement said.A sequel, \u201cDolphin Tale 2,\u2033 was released three years later starring Winter and Hope, another rescued dolphin cared for by the Clearwater aquarium.Bottlenose dolphins can live up to 60 years and are considered one of the most intelligent of all animal species.Winter and Hope are by far the most famous residents of the Clearwater aquarium, which also operates sea turtle and manatee rescue programs.An $80 million expansion of the facility was recently completed, including a 1.5 million-gallon (56 million-liter) new dolphin complex, to handle the crowds that have descended on the aquarium since \u201cDolphin Tale\u201d was released a decade ago.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior Foreign Affairs Reporter, HuffPostEach day in October 2018 brought a chilling new revelation about the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi agents chopped off his fingers, then carved his corpse into pieces. Khashoggi\u2019s remains seemingly vanished into thin air. And the kill squad had clear ties to one of the most powerful men on the planet: Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman.Joe Biden weighed in on Oct. 17, 2018. He said his doubts about the notoriously impetuous prince had been confirmed and that Saudi Arabia \u201cabsolutely, positively\u201d should face repercussions.After launching his presidential campaign, Biden called the killing a sign that it was time to reform the United States\u2019 cozy relationship with the Saudis. \u201cWe will make clear that America will never again check its principles at the door just to buy oil or sell weapons,\u201d Biden told the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank. \u201cAmerica needs to insist on responsible Saudi actions and impose consequences for reckless ones.\u201dThe candidate and his advisers understood the stakes of Washington\u2019s reaction to the Khashoggi murder: The U.S. could either encourage more human rights violations or pressure governments around the world to restrain themselves for fear of losing crucial American support. Meanwhile, then-President Donald Trump argued that ethical concerns mattered less than Saudi cash \u2014 and Democrats relentlessly attacked him for it.In the nine months since he took over from Trump, Biden could have meaningfully punished Saudi Arabia and its prince. Instead, the U.S. response to Khashoggi\u2019s killing has been too puny to deter future abuses, according to national security officials and experts and prominent rights groups. And the kingdom is restoring its standing internationally, safeguarding itself from consequences for similar crimes in the future.In February, the Biden administration identified the crown prince as the mastermind of the killing but said it would not target him with financial sanctions or a travel ban. Six months later, officials welcomed Khalid bin Salman, the prince\u2019s brother and a key player in the Khashoggi assault, to Washington for a high-profile visit. Biden greenlit $500 million in U.S. military maintenance for Saudi aircraft soon afterward, then in November \u2014 exactly one month after the anniversary of Khashoggi\u2019s murder \u2014 approved a $650 million deal for Riyadh to purchase American missiles.Meanwhile, the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund expanded its sway over the U.S. economy, and the Saudis repaired their sprawling Washington influence machine, replacing lobbyists they lost over Khashoggi and courting members of Congress \u2014 notably Republicans, some of whom have previously given vital support to rebukes of the kingdom.As Riyadh has strengthened its position, Saudi authorities have continued to pummel dissidents \u2014 most recently by confirming a 20-year sentence for an aid worker who criticized the regime \u2014 and allegedly continue to threaten perceived foes abroad, from a United Nations rapporteur to a former Saudi intelligence chief. And Saud al-Qahtani, a high-ranking Saudi official whom U.S. intelligence accused of directing the Khashoggi operation, has regained his role in court business and pro-government propaganda.\u201cThat\u2019s the message he got from the killing of Khashoggi: Not that he wouldn\u2019t kill, but that he would be smarter next time.\u201dTo Saudi rights activist Abdullah Alaoudh, the situation seems designed to convince the crown prince \u2014 known colloquially by his initials, MBS \u2014 that he can operate with impunity.\u201cThe same team that actually led to all this, led by MBS, is still not just existing but operating as if nothing ever happened: every day, they arrest new people,\u201d said Alaoudh, who is now the research director at Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), an organization Khashoggi founded before his death. At most, the prince might have learned to be savvier about public relations. \u201cThat\u2019s the message he got from the killing of Khashoggi: Not that he wouldn\u2019t kill, but that he would be smarter next time,\u201d said Alaoudh, whose father has been imprisoned in Saudi Arabia since 2017.Many Biden allies and powerful advocates want the president to send a more direct message: to reprimand the prince on behalf of Khashoggi and to show that the U.S. stands with people around the world who fight for democratic ideals.Prominent Democrats, including former State Department human rights official Rep. Tom Malinowski (N.J.), are advancing a slew of bills to reshape the U.S.-Saudi relationship, newly tying the alliance to whether the kingdom respects values like freedom of speech. Their plans have universal Democratic support in the House and have not yet faced GOP objections. They hope to convince the Senate \u2014 where Democrats who are skeptical of Saudi Arabia are also in charge \u2014 to attach those proposals to this year\u2019s defense authorization act, an annual bill that Washington treats as essential to pass into law. That would force Biden to confront the Khashoggi issue again before the end of the year \u2014 and to show whether he will go further to deliver on his talk of justice.The Biden team \u201cdid a very important thing by telling the truth about MBS\u2019s direct involvement,\u201d Malinowski told HuffPost. \u201cThe remaining question is whether the truth has consequences.\u201d In the weeks following Khashoggi\u2019s murder, reporters and law enforcement worldwide quickly unraveled the kingdom\u2019s paper-thin cover story, and Washington moved surprisingly fast to pressure Saudi Arabia. Top policymakers \u2014 including Saudi allies like Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) \u2014 demanded transparency and threatened the kingdom with unprecedented sanctions. Well-connected lobbying firms decided to stop representing the Saudis.That November, Trump cut off U.S. aerial refueling for the devastating Saudi military intervention in Yemen. Then senators forced Trump to share classified intelligence implicating MBS in Khashoggi\u2019s death, which made them so angry that they voted to blame the crown prince for the killing and to end all American assistance for the Yemen campaign. (As one of his final acts in office, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan maintained the U.S. role in the war with help from five Democrats.)It seemed like a rare moment of possibility for justice. Democrats captured the House in the 2018 midterms and a bipartisan Senate majority repeatedly voted against America\u2019s pro-Saudi policy in Yemen. Trump\u2019s possible successors vowed to deliver accountability. In November 2019, Biden set a high standard for a future Democratic president: When asked about MBS\u2019s regime, he pledged to \u201cmake them pay the price and make them in fact the pariah that they are.\u201dHis passion thrilled experts who were devising ways to hold MBS and his team accountable. They knew the U.S. was unlikely to fully abandon the wealthy Middle Eastern kingdom, which is key to the global energy market, but they hoped a post-Trump administration would consider some of their suggestions.A president could, for instance, stop supporting repressive Saudi security agencies, block some of the prince\u2019s international investments or initiate an FBI probe into the Khashoggi operation that would be more rigorous than the Saudis\u2019 widely criticized investigation.  \u201cI thought [Biden] saying Saudi Arabia will be made a pariah state was just a foot-in-the-mouth moment. I never bought that,\u201d said Philippe Nassif, the Middle East advocacy director at Amnesty International USA. \u201cI don\u2019t know if people were really asking for that. What we were asking for is acknowledging what our own intelligence services said, what the U.N. said. I expected Biden to hold the crown prince responsible.\u201dAs Trump\u2019s prospects of winning the 2020 election declined, human rights campaigners felt that their opponents were on the back foot for once.\u201cWhether it\u2019s the Saudi regime or the Egyptian regime, those governments were concerned coming into this administration with the strong rhetoric that [Biden] presented centering democracy and human rights,\u201d said Seth Binder, the advocacy director at the nonprofit Project on Middle East Democracy.Crucially, lawmakers continued to focus on Khashoggi, considering legislation to protect other dissidents and to deter Saudi crackdowns. Pro-Saudi Republicans and complex negotiations undermined those proposals in 2019 and 2020, but critics of MBS believed that having an ally in the White House could finally turn them into law.Today, however, the Saudis and their peers don\u2019t face any major new limits on their repression.\u201cIn many respects, they\u2019ve called the Biden administration\u2019s bluff,\u201d Binder said.Saudi Arabia quickly realized that Khashoggi\u2019s murder threatened its relationship with its most important foreign backer. But after decades of working in Washington, the regime also knew America\u2019s levers of power \u2014 and how to collaborate with useful players in the U.S. and abroad.MBS deployed one of his favorite tactics: presenting his rule as the answer to complaints about his country\u2019s historic problems. In 2019, Riyadh appointed Princess Reema bint Bandar as the new Saudi ambassador to the U.S. She became the first female ambassador in the history of a country that had only lifted its ban on female drivers in 2017. MBS\u2019s circle promoted both Bandar\u2019s appointment and the end of the driving ban as proof of the prince\u2019s open-mindedness rather than a result of the long struggle of activist Saudi women \u2014 many of whom the crown prince had jailed.Bandar charmed even skeptical U.S. policymakers at receptions and official meetings, one State Department official told HuffPost shortly after her arrival. She had previously lived in the U.S. for 22 years while her father served as the Saudi representative in Washington and one of the city\u2019s most powerful diplomats, and she could easily deploy tricks like steering tough conversation to jokes about the Dallas Cowboys.The D.C. charm offensive drew on prominent lobbying firms who stood by the Saudis \u2014 notably Qorvis and Hogan Lovells \u2014 and the kingdom\u2019s ties to influential lawmakers, particularly hawks who see Saudi Arabia as a bulwark against Iran and Republicans wary of challenging one of Trump\u2019s favorite foreign partners.Simultaneously, the Saudis were trying a more unconventional tactic using a new ally: the Iowa-based PR firm Larson Shannahan Slifka Group, also known as LS2. Since the fall of 2019, LS2 has publicized Bandar and other Saudi officials far beyond Washington. In Arizona and Maine, Sioux Falls and Philadelphia, Saudi representatives have tried to sell MBS\u2019s narrative to college students, women in business, Jewish communities and fans of small-town radio.In pitching events, the firm doesn\u2019t pretend the Khashoggi killing never happened, according to a university professor who spoke with LS2 about a potential event and requested anonymity to protect relationships: \u201cThey\u2019re saying, we know the perception and that it\u2019s not easy.\u201d Despite the hokeyness of LS2\u2032s efforts and the possibility the campaign is fleecing the Saudis in time-honored American fashion \u2014 multiple people told HuffPost the firm dropped the ball after initially contacting them \u2014 the project could ultimately make it harder to hold MBS to account.\u201cThey\u2019ve leaned on sports teams, tourism, Instagram influencers \u2026 it\u2019s a soft power approach to show Saudi changing.\u201d\u201cBy enlisting trusted community members across the United States to help peddle the best possible version of the kingdom, the Saudi lobby has given its brand a homegrown, American-as-apple-pie shine,\u201d analysts Ben Freeman, Brian Steiner and Leila Riazi of the Center for International Policy think tank wrote in April. They noted that Saudi lobbyists in Washington highlight the embassy\u2019s outreach to lawmakers from the states they visit, \u201cdescribing audiences in such local forums as responding with \u2018overwhelmingly positive feedback\u2019 [without explaining] that the events themselves were orchestrated by the Saudi lobby.\u201dMBS boosted the public relations effort by offering hints of progress. His regime removed some hate speech from its school textbooks and Saudi officials said they were moving to end their horrifying intervention in Yemen.With governments and major companies still anxious about being associated with the kingdom, the Saudis wooed easier targets. \u201cThey\u2019ve leaned on sports teams, tourism, Instagram influencers \u2026 it\u2019s a soft power approach to show Saudi changing,\u201d Nassif of Amnesty International told HuffPost. That tack disturbed some audiences \u2014 but also won Riyadh unlikely defenders. When one Instagram user commented on a post from @TaraMilkTea, a social media figure who went on a Saudi-sponsored tour, to highlight the plight of a jailed activist, the influencer retorted that tourists should keep \u201can open mind.\u201dAs president, Biden started off by making good on campaign promises about Saudi Arabia.He slashed U.S. support for the Saudi intervention in Yemen and halted $768 million in weapons sales to the kingdom. His aides said the president would not speak with the prince, building hope that Biden would isolate him. The administration prepared to release a U.S. intelligence summary blaming MBS for Khashoggi\u2019s murder \u2014 underscoring that Biden was breaking with Trump, who ignored a congressional requirement to publish that assessment. And Riyadh felt the heat: Weeks after Biden\u2019s inauguration, the Saudis freed two jailed women\u2019s rights activists.Then, in February, Biden unveiled what he described as his Khashoggi policy.It contained no sanctions for the prince and no details on what evidence American officials used to identify him as responsible. It punished only low-level Saudis without naming most of those who would be affected. In a State Department announcement titled \u201cAccountability for the Murder of Jamal Khashoggi,\u201d Secretary of State Tony Blinken did not even use the word \u201caccountability.\u201d Instead, he said the administration was \u201cproviding transparency\u201d and offered hope that change would come: \u201cwe have made absolutely clear that extraterritorial threats and assaults by Saudi Arabia against activists, dissidents, and journalists must end.\u201dThe big reveal felt like being \u201chit in the face with a basketball,\u201d Nassif said.The Washington Post, Khashoggi\u2019s last employer, slammed Biden. The president \u201clet the murderer walk,\u201d wrote Nicholas Kristof of The New York Times. Meanwhile, MBS\u2019s supporters rejoiced at the prince\u2019s success in dodging consequences or embarrassing revelations: 250,000 Twitter users \u2015 the vast majority of them acting of their own accord \u2015 reacted to Biden\u2019s move by circulating the hashtag #WeAreAllMohammedBinSalman, researchers found.Three weeks after Biden pledged to root his foreign policy in values like human rights, he showed he did not apply that standard to America\u2019s long and morally dubious relationship with Saudi Arabia.Saudis view his choice as a clear miscalculation. Lina Alhathloul, whose sister Loujain was released from a Saudi prison early in the Biden era, said the president\u2019s tough rhetoric clearly \u201chad results.\u201dBut her sister is still banned from leaving Saudi Arabia and is facing a yearslong sentence on sketchy charges. Alhathloul believes the U.S. must demand a systematic change to make any real progress for democratic ideals within the kingdom. \u201cAs long as MBS is in power and as long as he has as much power in his hands, nothing will change,\u201d she said.Biden says he\u2019s being cautious because he has to be. \u201cWe have never \u2026 when we have an alliance with a country, gone to the acting head of state and punished that person and ostracized him,\u201d Biden told ABC in March.  Saudi Arabia is not a treaty ally, however \u2014 and its head of state is King Salman. Keen observers of the kingdom say Biden could and should have gone further.\u201cIf you only hold the henchmen accountable, you are in effect reinforcing the crown prince\u2019s cover story, which was that it was just these rogue actors working for him,\u201d said Malinowski, the New Jersey congressman. \u201cIt also underlines what has long been a dysfunctional aspect of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. \u2026 We always take it upon ourselves to make the problems they cause go away for the sake of the relationship, when that burden really should be on them.\u201dRep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), who represents the congressional district where Khashoggi lived, said Biden should push high-ranking Saudis to disempower MBS. \u201cHe is an unacceptable leader from our point of view because of this tragedy, and they need to look for other leadership,\u201d Connolly said.For now, Biden\u2019s team has signaled that it sees the prince as a partner who is going nowhere \u2014 and whom Washington does not want to anger because he could threaten the president\u2019s foreign policy agenda. That approach works for Riyadh: The Saudis \u201chave adjusted to the Biden administration,\u201d said Gregory Gause, an international affairs professor at Texas A&M University. The U.S.\u2019s main admonishment to the prince is that pursuing \u201cdissidents who are frankly not all that threatening to the regime is not worth it,\u201d he added. But lawmakers and activists say Biden\u2019s strategy is too weak to even convince MBS of that logic.For instance, they argue that the president\u2019s so-called \u201cKhashoggi ban\u201d barring travel to the U.S. for people who harass dissidents \u2014 including more than 70 Saudis, according to the administration \u2014 will only be effective if the people it affects are publicly named and shamed.A State Department spokesperson said visa confidentiality laws make that impossible, but Malinowski rejected that explanation: \u201cThey just got that wrong, and I think they know it,\u201d he said.According to the congressional research service, a previous regulation would allow the State Department to name people who are banned from visiting the U.S. over human rights violations. The Biden administration said it would consider using that regulation to identify people covered by the Khashoggi ban, but it has not yet done so. Biden could also release or gather more intelligence to boost the assessment blaming MBS and expose the still-murky role of his allies, like the government of Egypt, as well as complete and publish his promised review of U.S.-Saudi relations, said Binder of the Project on Middle East Democracy.Prioritizing human rights doesn\u2019t have to mean shattering the U.S.-Saudi relationship, said Alaoudh, the Saudi activist at Khashoggi\u2019s organization DAWN. He pointed to the Saudi deputy defense minister\u2019s visit in July as an opportunity that Biden\u2019s team squandered.\u201cThey could have said to MBS: \u2018If you want to send your brother to normalize yourself and your administration here in D.C., you can do steps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 \u2014 and if you do three steps, that\u2019s fantastic,\u2019\u201d Alaoudh said. \u201c[But] they allowed him to come \u2026 and he sold this as a huge victory for him and his supporters in Saudi Arabia.\u201d Speaking shortly after the third anniversary of Khashoggi\u2019s killing, a career State Department official said the Biden team no longer seems interested in accountability for the murder. The file is \u201clost,\u201d the official told HuffPost. \u201cAs long as MBS is in power and as long as he has as much power in his hands, nothing will change.\u201dFor lawmakers and activists who challenge Saudi rights abuses, Biden now presents familiar hurdles.\u201cThe establishment thinking around the U.S.-Saudi partnership is back in full force,\u201d said Erica Fein, the advocacy director at the nonprofit Win Without War. Historically, American politicians have blasted Saudi Arabia on the campaign trail but handled the kingdom with kid gloves once in office.Fein\u2019s job is even harder now that Democrats control the White House and both chambers of Congress. \u201cThere are fewer champions on [Capitol] Hill and in other political spaces that are willing to really fight the Biden administration on this,\u201d she said. Biden\u2019s party has been surprisingly silent so far about his November announcement of a huge arms deal for the Saudis.Yet for Fein and others who speak of aligning America\u2019s foreign policy with the country\u2019s democratic values and ending Washington\u2019s pattern of enabling atrocities, achieving justice for Khashoggi is a major test. MBS\u2019s peers, from other world leaders to corporate figures, are closely watching to see whether that movement can change the status quo \u2014 and if the Saudis will no longer enjoy impunity. \u201cIf you can\u2019t [address] the most internationalized, symbolic killing of a journalist who had ties to the U.S., who was a well-known figure in the media, then we\u2019re going to have a problem on a whole host of human rights issues across the world that are less covered by the media,\u201d Nassif said. \u201cI\u2019m going to be fighting almost as much \u2026 to push Biden out of this comfort zone that our government has been in for a long time when it comes to Middle East allies, where they fund them and arm them at the expense of progress on the ground.\u201dConnolly, the congressman from Virginia, sees Biden repeating a mistake of his predecessors: treating national security as only a matter for the executive branch. Launching a broader debate over foreign policy decision-making is a priority for progressives, anti-war conservatives and other advocates for reforming America\u2019s international posture \u2014 and if Congress can ensure there are consequences for Khashoggi\u2019s death, it would push Washington one step forward.\u201cEvery administration forgets that Congress is \u2026 the premier branch of government that determines war and peace,\u201d Connolly said. MBS\u2019s critics say Biden could be bolder in many ways: trimming military support for Saudi Arabia, intervening in the kingdom\u2019s case against a former Saudi intelligence official who is now critical of the prince, or endorsing the proposals for reforming Saudi behavior that Democrats have inserted into this year\u2019s defense authorization bill.And the regime\u2019s opponents are pushing on other fronts. In September, DAWN \u2014 the group Khashoggi founded \u2014 launched a campaign asking lawmakers to shun lobbyists for Saudis implicated in the murder.\u201cTo lobby for oppressors is to be an oppressor,\u201d Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), a supporter of the effort, told HuffPost. After she and other lawmakers said they would no longer meet with a representative of the lobbying behemoth Squire Patton Boggs, the firm terminated a longstanding contract with one of the prince\u2019s chief aides.Biden has shown he is willing to pressure the Saudis, to ease the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, for instance, and to satisfy the families of victims of the 9/11 attacks, whose perpetrators were mostly Saudi citizens. He still has the chance to get tough for the sake of human rights.If he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll risk further brutality and fuel cynicism among people like Mohamed Soltan, a prominent Egyptian American activist who, like many in his generation, saw Khashoggi as a mentor. Soltan, who regularly speaks with administration officials, said Biden could once again demonstrate that America\u2019s ideals matter little compared to political expediency \u2014 that concern for Khashoggi was simply driven by \u201canti-Trump stuff.\u201d\u201cThis is an administration that came at a time when domestically there was a real threat to our democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey came in talking a big game about centering human rights in our foreign policy, and they just don\u2019t walk the walk.\u201dSenior Foreign Affairs Reporter, HuffPost"}

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 At least 13 former Trump administration officials violated the law by intermingling campaigning with their official government duties, according to a new federal investigation released Tuesday.The report from the Office of Special Counsel says the officials broke the law without consequence and with the administration\u2019s approval as part of a \u201cwillfull disregard for the Hatch Act,\u201d which prohibits government officials from using their official roles to influence elections, including supporting candidates while acting in their official capacities.\u201cThe cumulative effect of these repeated and public violations was to undermine public confidence in the nonpartisan operation of government,\u201d they wrote, adding that, \u201csuch flagrant and unpunished violations erode the principal foundation of our democratic system\u2014the rule of law.\u201dThe office investigated officials\u2019 comments in the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, including the Republican National Convention, which was held at the White House in a major break from historical norms.While the Office of Special Counsel concluded that hosting the event at the White House did not itself violate the Hatch Act, it found plenty of other instances where Trump officials did, mostly by promoting the former president\u2019s reelection in media interviews in which they appeared in their official capacity.Among the officials cited are former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, Jared Kushner, who served as senior adviser to the president, former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, Kellyanne Conway, then counselor to the president, Stephen Miller, who served as Trump\u2019s senior policy adviser, and Robert O\u2019Brien, the former national security adviser. Conway had been repeatedly cited by the office, which at one point went so far as to call for her removal.\u201cIn each case, the subject official was identified by their official title, discussed administration policies and priorities related to their official duties, and/or spoke from the White House grounds,\u201d the report reads.The investigation also found that then-Secretary of State Michael Pompeo changed State Department policy to allow himself to speak at Trump\u2019s convention and then referenced official work in his speech. And it found then-acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf violated the Hatch Act by presiding over a naturalization ceremony that was orchestrated for convention programming.\u201cBoth reflect the Trump administration\u2019s willingness to manipulate government business for partisan political ends,\u201d the report reads, adding that, \u201cThe administration\u2019s willful disregard for the law was especially pernicious considering the timing of when many of these violations took place.\u201dThe report notes the office repeatedly warned Trump White House officials about their violations, but that the former president who is responsible for enforcing the law for high-ranking officials never bothered to do that.Given the limited power the office has to enforce violations, the report suggested potential changes to the law, including a statutory amendment that would allow it to fine Senate-confirmed presidential appointees and commissioned officers, as well as greater investigative power. They also recommended an amendment to clarify which areas of the White House should be off-limits to political activity.\u201c(T)he 2020 election revealed that, at least with respect to an administration\u2019s senior most officials, the Hatch Act is only as effective as the White House decides it will be. Where, as happened here, the White House chooses to ignore the Hatch Act\u2019s requirements, then the American public is left with no protection against senior administration officials using their official authority for partisan political gain in violation of the law,\u201d it reads.Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a nonprofit watchdog group, said the report underscored the need for better enforcement.\u201cThis report confirms that there was nothing less than a systematic co-opting of the powers of the federal government to keep Donald Trump in office,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, president of the group. \u201cCongress must act now so that this never happens again.\u201d\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPostWASHINGTON \u2014 The House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol incited by former President Donald Trump has issued subpoenas to another half-dozen of his associates, including top Trump campaign aides and the author of the now-infamous memo advising then-Vice President Mike Pence to simply declare Trump the winner of the 2020 election.John Eastman, who wrote that Pence had the unilateral authority to give Trump a second term despite Trump\u2019s loss, former campaign manager Bill Stepien and former campaign strategist Jason Miller have all been subpoenaed, as has former national security adviser and pardoned felon Michael Flynn, who advised Trump to declare martial law and force states to rerun their elections.\u201cIn the days before the January 6th attack, the former president\u2019s closest allies and advisors drove a campaign of misinformation about the election and planned ways to stop the count of Electoral College votes,\u201d committee chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said. \u201cThe select committee needs to know every detail about their efforts to overturn the election, including who they were talking to in the White House and in Congress, what connections they had with rallies that escalated into a riot, and who paid for it all.\u201dTrump campaign staffer Angela McCallum and Bernard Kerik, former New York City police commissioner and another Trump-pardoned felon, were also issued subpoenas.All six have been ordered to turn over relevant documents to the committee no later than Nov. 23 and to sit for under-oath depositions late this month and through the first two weeks of December.The Jan. 6 committee has already subpoenaed some two dozen Trump aides and allies. Most are complying, although Trump\u2019s former White House aide Steve Bannon has been held in contempt of Congress for refusing, and former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark refused to answer numerous questions, claiming an executive privilege that the committee does not recognize.Stepien, who managed Trump\u2019s campaign in its final months, \u201csupervised the conversion of the Trump presidential campaign to an effort focused on \u2018Stop the Steal\u2019 messaging and related fundraising,\u201d according to the subpoena, which states that the campaign urged states to \u201cdelay or deny certification of electoral votes\u201d and to send \u201cmultiple slates of electoral votes to the United States Congress.\u201d Stepien did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s query.Miller, another top Trump campaign official for most of 2020, repeatedly spread Trump\u2019s lies about the election in media interviews and on Bannon\u2019s podcast in the weeks leading up to Jan. 6. He also crafted a statement from Trump claiming that the president and vice president were in complete agreement about Pence\u2019s ability to give Trump a second term, when, in fact, Pence had been telling Trump the opposite for weeks. Miller also did not respond to a HuffPost query.McCallum, according to her subpoena, participated in the effort to persuade Republican state lawmakers to appoint an alternate slate of electors because of the \u201cwidespread election fraud,\u201d which, in fact, did not exist. She could not be reached for comment.Eastman, then a law professor at Chapman University in Southern California, publicly and in private meetings with Trump and Pence pushed the idea that during Congress\u2019s certification of the election, the vice president could unilaterally declare some electoral votes to be invalid and thereby award Trump a second term. He spoke at the Jan. 6 rally and repeated Trump\u2019s lies about fraud to rile up the crowd. He did not respond to a HuffPost query.Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during the Russia investigation but whom Trump later pardoned, publicly and privately advised Trump to seize voting machines in states narrowly won by Democrat Joe Biden, declare martial law and then force those states to rerun their elections. He could not be reached for comment.Kerik, who pleaded guilty to tax fraud and other charges but was also pardoned by Trump, took part in the post-election campaign to falsely claim massive voter fraud. He also helped organize and took part in a Jan. 6 \u201cwar room\u201d at the Willard Hotel near the White House as a last-ditch effort to coerce Pence into reversing the election on Trump\u2019s behalf. Kerik also could not be reached.Trump\u2019s spokespeople, who have continued repeating his lies that the election had been \u201cstolen,\u201d did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s query about the new subpoenas.Trump became the first president in 232 years of U.S. elections to refuse to turn over power peacefully to his successor.He spent weeks attacking the legitimacy of the Nov. 3 contest he lost, starting his lies in the predawn hours of Nov. 4 that he had really won in a \u201clandslide\u201d and that his victory was being \u201cstolen\u201d from him. Those falsehoods continued through a long string of failed lawsuits challenging the results in a handful of states.Trump, Flynn and other advisers even discussed using the United States military by invoking the Insurrection Act or declaring martial law to retain power despite having lost the election, including by seizing voting machines and ordering \u201cre-votes\u201d in states Biden narrowly won.But military leaders had earlier made clear they would not involve themselves in the political process, so after the Electoral College finally voted on Dec. 14, making Biden\u2019s win official, Trump instead turned to a last-ditch scheme to pressure his own vice president into canceling the ballots of millions of voters in several states Biden won and declaring Trump the winner during the pro-forma congressional certification of the election results on Jan. 6.Trump asked his followers to come to Washington that day, and then told the tens of thousands who showed up to march on the Capitol to intimidate Pence into doing what Trump wanted. \u201cWhen you catch somebody in a fraud, you\u2019re allowed to go by very different rules,\u201d Trump said.The mob of supporters he incited attempted to do his bidding by storming the building. They even chanted \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d after Pence refused to comply with Trump\u2019s demands.A police officer died after being assaulted during the insurrection, and four others took their own lives in the days and weeks that followed. One of the rioters was fatally shot as she climbed through a broken window into an anteroom containing still-evacuating House members, and three others in the crowd died during the melee.While the House impeached Trump for inciting the attack, all but seven Senate Republicans, led by their leader, Kentucky\u2019s Mitch McConnell, chose not to convict him \u2014 thereby letting Trump continue his political career even as faces several investigations into his post-election actions.Trump and his allies are now engaged in a campaign to portray the rioter who was shot, Ashli Babbitt, as a martyr and the hundreds of others who have been arrested as victims of political persecution. Trump himself continues to suggest he will run for the 2024 GOP nomination and is using his Save America committee\u2019s money to continue spreading the same falsehoods that culminated in the violence of Jan. 6.Senior White House Correspondent, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

There is no reason for this.\u201dHowever, there is documentation to support the charges. The criminal complaint includes bodycam footage of Neumann attempting to break through the outer barricades around the Capitol on Jan. 6, at one point reaching over the metal barrier to punch an officer with a balled fist:Neumann told Belarus 1 that he fled the U.S. for Italy in March at the advice of a lawyer, and went on to rent an apartment in Ukraine for four months. He said he left Ukraine for Belarus after Ukrainian security services started following him, and that he arrived at the Belarusian border on Aug. 15. When he arrived there, he was taken into custody.The criminal complaint notes Neumann attended the Ukrainian Orange Revolution in 2004 and 2005, which could explain why the country\u2019s secret police may have taken an interest in him. He wore an orange and yellow scarf commemorating the event to the U.S. Capitol in January:Belarus appears eager to use Neumann\u2019s story to boost its anti-West propaganda.In an excerpt from the segment translated to English by The Moscow Times, the host portrays Neumann as \u201cthe same type of simple American whose shops were burned by Black Lives Matter activists,\u201d adding that he \u201clost almost everything and is being persecuted by the U.S. government\u201d only because he \u201csought justice and asked uncomfortable questions.\u201dBelarus\u2019 authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, claimed victory in a heavily disputed election last August, sparking massive protests and leading to renewed global scrutiny of \u201cEurope\u2019s last dictatorship.\u201d Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, responded by brutally repressing dissidents and arresting thousands.In May, Belarusian authorities hijacked a Ryanair flight so they could arrest Raman Pratasevich, a journalist who has been critical of the regime.And in August, a prominent Belarusian activist who helped Belarusians fleeing prosecution was found dead under suspicious circumstances in a Ukrainian park, not far from his home.The country\u2019s dire political circumstances were again highlighted during the Tokyo Olympics this summer, when Belarusian sprinter Krystsina Tsimanouskaya was granted asylum after officials threatened her for questioning team management on social media.National Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Ciattarelli waged a strong campaign against Murphy, spending almost as much money as the governor and outpacing the GOP\u2019s performance in the state four years ago. But Murphy\u2019s advantages \u2015 such as a million more registered Democrats and winning the mail-in vote \u2015 proved too much for the Republican to beat.New Jersey Democrats didn\u2019t completely escape defeat, though. Longtime state Senate President Steve Sweeney, who helped enact many of Murphy\u2019s progressive initiatives, lost reelection last week to a Republican newcomer who spent only $2,300 on his campaign. Edward Durr, a furniture company truck driver, unexpectedly defeated Sweeney in the state\u2019s 3rd Legislative District.The governor\u2019s reelection spared Democrats the loss of a second gubernatorial seat, after Republican businessman Glenn Youngkin defeated Terry McAuliffe in Virginia\u2019s race for governor \u2015 a race that exacerbated worries that President Joe Biden\u2019s falling approval ratings and congressional Democrats\u2019 struggles to enact their agenda are hurting the party.\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s been a rough and tough year. And we knew it would be. President Biden has said this all the time. We\u2019re in a yearlong effort to dig out of the holes we were left,\u201d White House chief of staff Ron Klain told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday, mentioning that the administration inherited a debt economy, high unemployment and mass deaths from COVID-19.\u201cSo, I understand that voters are tired, Americans are tired of how long it\u2019s taken to get the economy moving, to get COVID under control.

The issue of the teaching of \u201ccritical race theory\u201d \u2015 a post-civil rights era legal theory that racism is systemic in American law and institutions \u2015 in public schools provided an ambiguous enough target to mobilize the rural Trump base to go to the polls while overlapping the issue with other education-related anxieties for persuadable suburban voters.In Virginia, the critical race theory issue did not focus on the teaching of actual critical race theory, which is almost exclusively taught in universities and law schools. Nor did it solely focus on clumsy anti-racist teachings or the ideas that some anti-racist consultants promote that stem from critical race theory concepts.But the issue still helped Youngkin turn out the base without scaring off swing voters in the way needed to win amid high turnout.Finding an issue to do both was needed to win amid high turnout. Every election since Trump took office has seen increased turnout from a more motivated electorate. The 2017, the Virginia gubernatorial race saw turnout hit a record that was broken again this year. The 2018 midterms also saw record-high turnout, as did the 2020 presidential race. Each election appears to be building on the one that preceded it \u2014 and any lingering doubts that Trump\u2019s effective absence from the political scene would dampen turnout have been quieted.Though high turnout was once thought to confer an advantage to Democrats, with their base of support among lower-propensity voters, Trump\u2019s mobilization of the electorate, on both sides, means that Republicans remain as competitive in a world of high turnout as they were when voter numbers dropped precipitously, as they has in elections prior to Trump\u2019s election.Youngkin\u2019s win and the unexpectedly close New Jersey gubernatorial election, which had much lower turnout, also show that the GOP can do it without Trump on the ballot.The main effect of Trump\u2019s two presidential election campaigns has been radical polarization along lines of educational attainment. Not only did he reveal and turn out a whole new batch of non-college-educated white voters who lean to the right, but he also converted some non-college-educated Latino voters (and non-college-educated Black voters, to a much lesser extent) to vote Republican. At the same time, college-educated voters of all races went Democratic at the presidential level at higher rates than ever before.Youngkin\u2019s win is a warning to Democrats that Republicans have a strategy for maintaining sky-high support from non-college-educated white voters, especially in rural areas, that doesn\u2019t deter them from persuading some suburban voters who had swung hard to Democrats. This augurs very poorly for Democrats in next year\u2019s midterm elections unless the party finds a way to turn President Joe Biden\u2019s low poll numbers around and mobilize their base.Virginia\u2019s turnout on Tuesday hit nearly 74% of the record 2020 turnout, which was the highest proportion of a previous presidential vote\u2019s turnout seen in an off-year election in the state. It was nearly 10 percentage points higher than the 2017 gubernatorial turnout relative to the 2016 presidential election vote.Youngkin won an unprecedented portion of his party\u2019s presidential vote by netting 85% of Trump\u2019s total in 2020. Democrat Terry McAuliffe won just 66% of Biden\u2019s 2020 total votes. Youngkin\u2019s gains came across the board in nearly every county.Though much focus is on the swing to the GOP in the suburbs that Democrats have come to count on for their wins, Youngkin also hit higher margins than Trump did in heavily GOP rural areas.The question this raises is whether Youngkin\u2019s incredible vote total can be attributed to getting Republicans out to vote or to persuasion of swing voters. And there are points for both. Youngkin beat Trump\u2019s vote totals in the hardcore Trump-voting rural counties, a huge accomplishment. He also flipped swing counties and cut into margins in the suburbs of Washington, Richmond and Virginia Beach.Youngkin fought the election largely on the issue of public education. He targeted the suburbs and swing counties by stating his opposition to COVID-19 school closures and mask mandates, a huge point of contention in a state that saw one of the most extended pandemic school closures in the country, and he called for increasing teacher pay. For the rural base, Youngkin, with the aid of the conservative media ecosystem, provided opposition to the teaching of critical race theory that has become a stand-in for all issues related to race, diversity and inclusion in Virginia public schools.There is an ongoing disagreement over whether Youngking\u2019s win was tied to his campaign against critical race theory or the COVID school closures, or that it was merely the traditional political swing after a presidential election \u2015 the so-called \u201cthermostatic public opinion\u201d in which the opposition party beats the president\u2019s party in off-year and midterm votes, especially when the incumbent is as unpopular as Biden is today. But they can also all be true at the same time.Just look at the most defining moment of the race, which took place at the Sept. 29 televised debate, when Youngkin attacked McAuliffe for vetoing a bill in his first stint as governor that would have required schools to inform parents about \u201csexually explicit\u201d books in their libraries.\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the course of this last 20 months is our school systems refusing to engage with parents,\u201d Youngkin said. \u201cIn fact, in Fairfax County this past week, we watched parents so upset because there was such sexually explicit material in the library they had never seen, it was shocking.\u201d\u201cYou believe school systems should tell children what to do. I believe parents should be in charge of their kids\u2019 education,\u201d Youngkin added.\u201cYeah, I stopped the bill, that I don\u2019t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach,\u201d McAuliffe replied. The latter part of that quote was a staple of Youngkin attack ads for weeks.Youngkin\u2019s attack on McAuliffe conflated the \u201c20 months\u201d of coronavirus school closures with the manufactured controversy over diversity and inclusion \u2015 a school library contained books with passages depicting gay sex. In doing so, he turned McAuliffe\u2019s defense of public school teachers and the LGBTQ community into a dismissive remark about parents being angry that Virginia kept schools closed longer than almost every other state in the country.In this way, Youngkin\u2019s turning of critical race theory into a framework for a broad-based critique served the purpose it was meant for when it was constructed in a conservative think-tank lab.Chris Rufo, a fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, began the campaign to attack critical race theory by highlighting materials used in corporate and government-issued \u201cdiversity, equity and inclusion\u201d manuals and trainings. It\u2019s not as though there was no controversy over these issues (or others, like transgender inclusion) prior to Rufo\u2019s intervention, but he explicitly concatenated them into a political strategy. He created a political category label that could become a \u201cmaster-signifier,\u201d as the writer John Ganz called it, to encompass all anxiety about social efforts, no matter the content, directed toward diversity and inclusion, particularly around race but also around gender and sexuality.\u201cWe have successfully frozen their brand \u2015 \u2018critical race theory\u2019 \u2015 into the public conversation and are steadily driving up negative perceptions,\u201d Rufo wrote in March. \u201cWe will eventually turn it toxic, as we put all of the various cultural insanities under that brand category. The goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think \u2018critical race theory.\u2019\u201dCritical race theory acted as Rufo wanted it to, and it became a master-signifier for all gripes about social change at schools.Critical race theory came to encompass school libraries with LGBTQ books on the shelf, a phony transgender panic related to a sexual assault in a girl\u2019s bathroom at a school, a mother wanting to ban Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cBeloved\u201d, lessons that said Andrew Jackson and the U.S. government committed ethnic cleansing and genocide and the elimination of some advanced placement math classes.Opposition to critical race theory became a mainstay on Fox News. Republicans in the Senate used their time in committees to persistently hammer on the fake transgender sexual assault story, which got picked up on Fox and throughout the conservative media ecosystem. Youngkin closed his campaign with rallies where he promised to \u201cban critical race theory on Day One,\u201d and an ad featuring the mother who wanted to ban \u201cBeloved,\u201d a book about slavery in America and an escaped mother\u2019s decision to kill her daughter rather than allow her to becoming enslaved.The critical race theory issue was red meat for Trump\u2019s Republican base while serving as seasoning for suburban swing voters that they could adjust to their own taste.Even though political swings against the current president\u2019s party are normal in off-year and midterm elections, opposition party voters still need to be motivated and mobilized to turn out, even when the president\u2019s approval rating is as low as Biden\u2019s current 43%, the lowest of any president at this point in their term, aside from Trump. The critical race theory issue nationalized the election for base voters and kept them engaged and angry, whether they lived in the Loudoun County suburb where critical race theory activism was at its highest or in the rural areas where Republicans needed to stay highly motivated to compete.And, just as crucially, it didn\u2019t scare off swing voters the way Trump\u2019s more vulgar racist appeals did. They could construct their own version of critical race theory to combine with preexisting anxieties about pandemic school closures. It enabled critiques of whether schools were prioritizing education or a confusing social theory, as can be seen around the elimination of some advanced placement classes. There are also critiques of some of the concepts that have become emblematic of what Rufo describes as critical race theory from liberal writers.The critical race theory issue can then be seen as a Trump-era update to the coded racial appeals that powered the conservative movement to political dominance over the last 40-plus years.In 1992, Tom and Mary Edsall wrote in their book \u201cChain Reaction\u201d that GOP dominance emerged from the interplay of the race and taxation issues. Working-class white voters, once the bedrock of the Democratic Party, began to defect to the Republicans in this period as the GOP successfully linked anti-tax sentiment to opposition to government programs promoting racial diversity and inclusion, along with the bureaucrats and academics promoting such programs.\u201cAt the core of Republican-populist strategy was a commitment to resist the forcing of racial, cultural and social liberalism on recalcitrant white, working and middle-class constituencies,\u201d the Edsalls wrote.This strategy started to change under Trump as his personal vulgarity and uncoded racism quickened a political realignment toward Democrats in the suburbs that was already under way. But Trump\u2019s rhetoric also mobilized other segments of the electorate \u2015 rural, non-college-educated whites and some non-college-educated Latinos \u2015 to remain highly competitive. Keeping them motivated without turning off persuadable swing voters is essential to compete in this new day of high-turnout elections.At least for the moment, critical race theory seems to have served its purpose in Virginia as an issue with a racial appeal just open enough to mobilize the base that Trump built since he entered politics and just coded enough for the suburban middle class that it could blend with complaints about how schools and state government handled COVID-19. By threading the needle in this manner, the issue also forces Democrats to respond in the worst possible political ways: Claiming the issue doesn\u2019t exist because actual critical race theory isn\u2019t being taught in schools. Blaming whole racial and gender groups for their loss. And, as McAuliffe did in the debate, simply defending unelected state employees and government bureaucrats from voter outrage.Democrats will need to find their own narrative to mobilize their base at increasingly high levels to remain competitive amid high turnouts. The invocation of Trump and the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol will only work in so many races. Perhaps enacting the policies they ran on will help, too. But what voters really need is a story that mobilizes them. Trump provided that to both sides. And critical race theory may continue to work for the GOP in other races. Democrats will need to develop a different response and narrative rather than accept off-year and midterm election losses as simply a matter of scientific fact while ceding the field to the Republican Party.Reporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "POLITICS", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostRepublicans regained majority control of the Virginia House of Delegates in Tuesday\u2019s election, ending Democrats\u2019 brief hold on a chamber they\u2019ve used to score some of the party\u2019s biggest legislative wins nationwide over the last two years.Democratic House of Delegates Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn conceded Friday night that the GOP would hold majority control of the chamber next year, The Associated Press reported. The AP and state election officials have not yet made official calls in every legislative contest, but the GOP will hold at least a 51-49 advantage in the body.\u201cWhile the results of the election were not in our favor, our work for the people of Virginia goes on,\u201d Filler-Corn said.Democrats entered Tuesday holding a 55-45 majority in the lower chamber of the Virginia state legislature, meaning Republicans needed to flip five seats to deadlock the body and six to regain control. By the end of election night, it was clear the GOP had won enough seats to at least create a tie the legislature, and the party is on track to pick up at least one more win. Republicans successfully defended all of their incumbents, and swiped seats from Democrats across the state.Republican control of the House of Delegates will be a major asset for Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin, who defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe on Tuesday night.The loss will cost Democrats their majority in one of the most important legislative chambers they flipped during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. In 2019, Democratic gains in the northern Virginia suburbs, the Richmond area and along the state\u2019s southeastern coast allowed the party to take total control of the Virginia state legislature for the first time in a generation. The national party gained a foothold in the South, and the commonwealth\u2019s blue future seemed to be cemented.Democrats still hold a 21-19 majority in the Virginia state Senate, which won\u2019t hold its next elections until 2023. But on issues like abortion rights, that thin advantage may not be enough to hold the line and block legislation that comes out of the GOP House. Democrats will also have to rely on their narrow state Senate majority to counter potential GOP efforts to curb voting rights. Three Republican candidates who were in Washington, D.C., for the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally that preceded the deadly Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol won elections to the House of Delegates. Two were incumbents, and the third, Del.-elect Marie March, touted her attendance at the rally during her campaign.Other conservative lawmakers have indicated that the outcome will lead to a renewed push for the sort of conspiracy theory-driven election audits that have already taken place in Arizona and are underway in other states, sparking fears among Democratic lawmakers that the GOP will attempt to roll back its expansions of early and weekend voting and seek to implement broader voting restrictions like those that 19 other Republican-controlled states have made law this year.Losing the House of Delegates will halt the ambitious legislative agenda Democrats have advanced over the last two years, which they were hoping to build on in future sessions. It will also likely exacerbate broader concerns about the party\u2019s ability to maintain power in state legislatures, which have powered the GOP\u2019s aggressive moves to the far right over the last decade.Virginia Democrats had pushed the state in the opposite direction. Over the last two years, they have passed new laws that expanded abortion access, bolstered voting rights, implemented gun control policies, created new LGBTQ protections, raised the minimum wage, abolished the death penalty and sought to transition the state off of fossil fuels and address climate change.Before they fully took control, Democrats also successfully expanded Medicaid, a change that allowed nearly 500,000 Virginians to access health care through the federal program, according to official figures.Back in power, Republicans could seek to reverse many of those policies \u2014 particularly with Youngkin in the governor\u2019s mansion.Democrats knew holding the majority would be tough, given that they had taken control by winning key districts that had long supported Republicans and voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election. But they entered the final stages of the race somewhat confident they would maintain their hold on the House of Delegates.It\u2019s the latest disappointment at the state level for a party that has suffered plenty of them. Although Democrats picked up 200 state legislative seats and flipped eight chambers during Trump\u2019s presidency, that only began to make up for the losses they suffered over the previous eight years, when the GOP picked up nearly 1,000 such seats across the country.Virginia\u2019s House of Delegates is already the third of those eight bodies to sink back into GOP hands, after New Hampshire Republicans regained control of both chambers in 2020, a year in which Democrats failed to flip a single legislature despite pouring record resources into such races.Still, the damage could have been worse: Dels. Wendy Gooditis, a vulnerable northern Virginia Democrat, and Schuyler VanValkenburg, who represents a suburban Richmond district, successfully defended their seats despite major GOP challenges. Del. Elizabeth Guzm\u00e1n, another northern Virginia Democrat targeted by Republicans, also held on to her seat.Early analyses of vote totals suggest that Democratic legislative candidates in key races may have outperformed McAuliffe, the party\u2019s gubernatorial nominee, according to the States Project, a progressive group that said six of the eight candidates it endorsed in Virginia outpaced McAuliffe. That\u2019s a marked difference from 2017, when Democratic legislative contenders ran behind the top of the ticket even as they picked up 16 seats in the House of Delegates, and 2020, when Democratic victories in the presidential race and key statewide contests didn\u2019t translate to major gains in legislatures. And it may foster at least some hope in Democrats and progressives that their renewed focus on state legislatures could pay off in more favorable environments.Next year\u2019s midterm elections were already going to pose challenges for the party, especially after a tough redistricting cycle in which Republicans controlled most state legislatures. Democrats have eyed Pennsylvania, Arizona and Michigan as potential opportunities to flip GOP-held legislatures. But if the political environment that drove the losses in Virginia remains the same, they may have to focus on protecting existing majorities in states like Maine and Colorado.That will be even more important in 2022, as GOP state legislatures continue to serve as an launchpad for the party\u2019s most anti-democratic whims. Republican efforts to limit voting rights and exert partisan influence over the management, oversight and even certification of elections have generated fears that the party could seek to use its legislative dominance to undermine future elections in ways it failed to last year, when Trump and the GOP attempted to contest the results of an election he lost.\u201cVirginia shows yet again that the radical right understands what\u2019s at stake in state legislatures,\u201d said Simone Leiro, a spokesperson for the States Project. \u201c2022 is our last chance to finally learn that lesson \u2015 or it will be proven when these majorities refuse to certify the election in 2024.\u201dReporter, HuffPost\nDo you have information you want to share with HuffPost? \r\n    Here\u2019s how.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) \u2014 Manuelito Wheeler isn\u2019t sure exactly why Navajo elders admire Western films.It could be that many of them were treated to the films in boarding schools off the reservation decades ago. Or, like his father, they told stories of gathering around a television growing up to watch gunslingers in a battle against good and evil on familiar-looking landscapes.Whatever the reason, Navajo elders have been asking Wheeler to dub a Western in the Navajo language ever since \u201cStar Wars IV: A New Hope\u201d was translated into Navajo and released in 2013.The result? \u201cB\u00e9eso Dah Yin\u00ed\u0142jaa\u2019\u201d or \u201cA Fistful of Dollars,\u201d an iconic Western starring Clint Eastwood who plays a stranger \u2014 known as \u201cThe Man With No Name\u201d \u2014 entering a Mexican village among a power struggle between families. The 1964 flick is the first in a trilogy of spaghetti Westerns produced and directed by Italians.Unlike many other Westerns produced in the U.S., it has no Native Americans in it. That appealed to Wheeler, the director of the Navajo Nation Museum.\u201cUsually in Westerns, there are inaccurate if not offensive depictions of Native people, so this one had no Natives, period,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThat just eliminated that aspect for me.\u201dA premiere for the crew and all-Navajo cast of voice actors is scheduled Nov. 16 at the movie theater in Window Rock, Arizona \u2014 the first showing since the venue shut down in March 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Limited seats are available to members of the public who are vaccinated against COVID-19 and consent to a rapid test on site.It will be screened for free later this month at other places on or near the Navajo Nation, which extends into Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.Other popular films dubbed in Indigenous languages include \u201cBambi\u201d in Arapaho, \u201cFrozen 2\u201d in S\u00e1mi, and \u201cMoana\u201d in Maori. The cartoon series \u201cThe Berenstain Bears\u201d was translated into the Dakota and Lakota languages.At least 20 Indigenous languages are spoken in films that are being showcased by the National Museum of the American Indian in November during Native American Heritage Month, program manager Cindy Benitez said Thursday. Indigenous people increasingly are producing and directing their own stories, she said, including some entirely in Indigenous languages.\u201cNative people in general have been so underrepresented that to have something like film here in 2021 not have their voices heard is an injustice,\u201d she said.\u201cA Fistful of Dollars\u201d is the third major film dubbed in Navajo, part of an effort to preserve the language. Elbert Jumbo voiced Bruce the shark and another fish in the Navajo version of \u201cFinding Nemo,\u201d released in 2016.Jumbo, who retired from the U.S. Army and lives in Many Farms, also voices Ramon in the Western film. The character calls the shots, terrorizes the town and believes he\u2019s untouchable. Jumbo said he nailed the over-the-top super villainous laugh characteristic of spaghetti Westerns.Jumbo speaks, writes and reads Navajo, a result of growing up in a home where that was the only option.\u201cPeople feel a little more pride in knowing that we\u2019ve come a long way with our language,\u201d said Jumbo, 47. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to say but some of it we\u2019re losing to the younger generation. But at the same time, I think movies like this inspire them to learn, even if it\u2019s just a little word here and there.\u201dIt was supposed to be released last year, but it was delayed because of the coronavirus.The Navajo Nation Museum teamed up with the New York-based Kino Lorber film distribution company and the Indigenous-owned Native Stars Studios in Gallup, New Mexico, for the film.\u201cI can\u2019t wait for my uncle to see this, for my dad to see this,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThe other feeling is I wish that those who have gone would be here to see this.\u201dBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "National Reporter, HuffPostMore than a week after the shooting on the \u201cRust\u201d film set in New Mexico, details continue to trickle out explaining how actor Alec Baldwin wound up with a loaded gun in his hand.Police have yet to conclude the investigation, but one element has become clear: Several people repeatedly mishandled the firearm that killed director of photography Halyna Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza.A small set of simple rules dictates how to handle firearms safely: Always know if the gun is loaded. Keep the barrel pointed in a safe direction. Never point a gun at anything you\u2019re not willing to destroy. Know your target and what lies beyond it.Those rules exist because humans are prone to error, but guns reliably fire when the operator pulls the trigger. With a swipe of his arm, Baldwin broke all four. And the people charged with handling guns on the set broke several more, all but ensuring that the weapon would morph from a prop into a dangerous liability.\u201cYou had to have more than one safety measure fail for that to happen,\u201d Doug McQuarrie, a former NAVY Seal who\u2019s helped bring firearm scenes to life on several film sets, told HuffPost.If Baldwin were anyone other than an actor, the shooting on the set of \u201cRust\u201d would be an obvious case of negligence. But he wasn\u2019t alone in mishandling the weapon.The inexperienced armorer in charge of the weapon, the assistant director who grabbed the gun and shouted \u201ccold,\u201d and crew members who reportedly took it for a round of target shooting all played some part in a long chain of compounding irresponsibility that led to a negligent discharge in an industry that portrays gun battles as a matter of routine \u2015 usually without incident.HuffPost spoke with firearms experts, including three with wide experience working on film sets, and reviewed public documents to understand what went wrong. While the investigation has yet to conclude and many details remain unknown, all agreed that several overlapping problems led to the fatal shot. And some suspect that Baldwin himself may own a share of the blame for mishandling a loaded weapon during rehearsal.\u201cThe rules are there,\u201d Bill Davis, a former police officer and armorer with two decades of experience, told HuffPost. \u201cYou follow them, you won\u2019t have a problem. If you don\u2019t follow them, you will. The safety protocols are only as good as the people observing them.\u201dThe confusion around the shooting revolves partly around the distinction between a gun and a \u201cprop gun.\u201d Prop guns are typically modified to fire only blanks, often through a plugged barrel. Baldwin didn\u2019t fire a \u201cprop gun\u201d in anything but a euphemistic sense. He pulled the trigger on a .45 revolver and it fired a projectile, almost certainly a bullet. It wasn\u2019t just a prop. It was a gun.That shouldn\u2019t have happened for at least two reasons. First, live rounds \u2015 cartridges that fire a bullet \u2015 aren\u2019t typically allowed on movie sets. But among the 500 rounds confiscated from the set, police found fake cartridges, blanks and live ammo. No one consulted by HuffPost could imagine a scenario where that made sense.\u201cI was absolutely shocked to hear that there were live rounds,\u201d McQuarrie said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen that on a set.\u201dAnd in the situation Baldwin was handling the revolver, prop masters said he shouldn\u2019t have used a real gun. The filmmakers weren\u2019t shooting a scene at the time. Instead, Baldwin was rehearsing the movement that would eventually make it into the scene, a practice known in the industry as \u201cblocking.\u201dBlocking rehearsals typically require neither a \u201chot\u201d gun loaded with blanks nor an unloaded \u201ccold\u201d gun, but a \u201cdummy\u201d gun \u2015 usually made of rubber or plastic and incapable of holding cartridges or firing bullets.Police recovered three different revolvers from the shooting scene, Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said Wednesday: a fully functioning .45 revolver, a gun with modification to the cylinder likely making it capable of firing only blanks, and a plastic gun.Even if there were live rounds on the set, they shouldn\u2019t have made it into the gun. Blanks are easy to tell from live rounds, because no bullet pokes out from the casing.Film sets don\u2019t appear to have universal standards for loading guns with blanks or demonstrating that they are unloaded. But most agreed that the armorer holds supreme authority of firearms used in movies, followed by other prop masters and technical consultants. That makes the chain of custody simple: Only the armorer or actor touches it.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen any crew allowed to touch any gun,\u201d McQuarrie said. \u201cNot ever.\u201d On the set of \u201cRust,\u201d however, those charged with monitoring the gun that fired the fatal shot left it out in the open. Instead of the armorer securing it, crew members used it to target shoot during off hours, according to news reports.And assistant director Dave Halls grabbed the gun and handed it to Baldwin, when that job should have fallen to Hannah Gutierrez Reed.The chain of mishaps ended with Baldwin himself. Despite the assistant director\u2019s call that the gun was \u201ccold\u201d (meaning unloaded), police affidavits indicate it held a single live round in the cylinder.Prop masters consulted by HuffPost disagree over whether Baldwin should have known. His reliance on the assistant director\u2019s word that the gun was unloaded flies in the face of safe firearms handling, which dictates that the first thing anyone handling a gun should do is check whether it\u2019s loaded, according to Mike Cargill, a firearms instructor and owner of Central Texas Gun Works in Austin.\u201cThis is definitely negligent,\u201d Cargill told HuffPost. \u201cIn the end, if you\u2019re the person holding the firearm, you\u2019re the person who\u2019s going to be held responsible.\u201dBut Hollywood appears to lack a universal standard dictating whether the actors should understand the status of the guns they handle. One said actors, by design, should rely on the expertise of the armorer. Checking the magazine or inspecting the cylinder runs the risk of disturbing the armorer\u2019s work, introducing an unwelcome element of uncertainty. \u201cI don\u2019t see any way, shape or form to blame Alec Baldwin,\u201d McQuarrie said. \u201cHe\u2019s in another world, acting. And all the other variables are being controlled by everybody else.\u201dBut at least in New York, according to prop master Lucien Charles, it\u2019s standard for armorers to load firearms that will contain blanks or demonstrate that a gun is unloaded in front of at least one other person, usually the assistant director, and often with the actor who will handle the gun present.\u201cObviously, Mr. Baldwin should have done that with the armorer, with the assistant director standing there,\u201d Charles said. \u201cAs long as everyone has an eye on it, they can make sure it\u2019s safe. And the AD will know it\u2019s a cold gun. It\u2019s unfortunate someone lost their life over someone not doing a safety check.\u201dAnd even if the gun was unloaded, Baldwin appeared to handle it irresponsibly, some said. No one should point a gun, even if unloaded, at another person.\u201cThe cardinal rule that he broke is he pointed a the gun at a human,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHe\u2019s handled guns in a lot of movies. He should know better.\u201dIt\u2019s unclear whether Baldwin, Gutierrez Reed, Halls or anyone else will face criminal charges in the \u201cRust\u201d shooting. Prosecutors are leaving \u201call options on the table,\u201d Santa Fe District Attorney Mary Carmack-Altwies said this week. The 1993 shooting that killed actor Brandon Lee on the set of the film \u201cThe Crow,\u201d the most similar case in an industry where firearm deaths are rare, did not result in criminal charges.Both the Lee and Hutchins shootings appear unintentional, which helps determine prosecutors\u2019 understanding. But the strict rules governing firearm safety leave virtually no room to pardon an unintentional shot as an accident. A gun fires when a human pulls the trigger, the logic goes, making someone responsible for 100% of the rounds that fly out of the barrel.\u201cIt\u2019s culpable negligence,\u201d Davis said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing accidental about it.\u201dNational Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostAn assistant director on the film \u201cRust,\u201d the site of a fatal shooting involving the actor Alec Baldwin last week, told investigators he didn\u2019t thoroughly check all the rounds in a prop gun before it was used to rehearse a scene, according to multiple media reports.The director, Dave Halls, was supposed to check all of the rounds before handing the gun to Baldwin and saying that it was \u201ccold,\u201d meaning there were no live rounds inside and that it was safe to use as a prop. Failure to do so is a major breach in safety protocol, The Los Angeles Times reported.The film\u2019s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, also reportedly opened the gun for him to inspect, but Halls said he couldn\u2019t remember if she spun the drum of the firearm to fully inspect it.\u201cHe advised he should have checked all of them, but didn\u2019t, and couldn\u2019t recall if she spun the drum,\u201d according to an affidavit obtained by The New York Times.The film\u2019s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, was shot and killed during the rehearsal. Its director, Joel Souza, was wounded.Officials first said Wednesday that a lead bullet had been recovered from Souza\u2019s shoulder and that they believed they had recovered more live rounds on the set of the film. The affidavit filed by investigators said they recovered about 500 rounds of ammunition from the set, which they believe to be a mixture of \u201cblanks, dummy rounds and what we are suspecting were live rounds.\u201dDummy rounds are designed to look like real bullets for close-up shots, although they contain no gunpowder. They typically have a small hole in them or an indentation showing they are not live, but The Los Angeles Times noted they require serious safety measures because they more closely resemble a real bullet than a blank.The affidavit also said that after the accidental shooting, Halls took the gun to Reed to inspect. When she opened it, investigators said, he saw \u201cat least four dummy casings with holes in the sides, and one without the hole.\u201d \u201cHe advised this did not have the cap on it and was just the casing,\u201d the affidavit added.An unnamed crew member told the newspaper that having live rounds on set was \u201cso far off the realm of what\u2019s wrong and bad,\u201d adding that anyone caught with that type of ammunition while filming scenes with guns would be \u201cfired immediately.\u201dSince the fatal incident, questions about blame and responsibility have swirled. Investigators are probing the roles of Halls and others on set, although no charges have been filed.This is a developing story.

But Siwa, who came out as queer in January, isn\u2019t the show\u2019s only LGBTQ contestant on its current season. Beloved Peloton instructor Cody Rigsby is also wowing audiences with his groovy footwork, and is partnered with dancer Cheryl Burke.Rigsby, a self-described \u201copinionated homosexual,\u201d said in an interview last week that he would have been willing to dance with a male partner on the show. As is often the case in Hollywood, however, the fast-paced, behind-the-scenes negotiations gave him little time to consider the big picture.\u201cWhen the conversation opportunity came up for \u2018Dancing With The Stars,\u2019 I was just so excited to be on the show, I guess I didn\u2019t even think it was a possibility,\u201d he explained to GLAAD\u2019s Anthony Allen Ramos. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t bring it up.

Elsewhere in his GLAAD interview, Rigsby reflected on his unlikely rise to fame amid the pandemic, as well as his struggles with accepting his sexuality while growing up in Greensboro, North Carolina. \u201cAt a young age, people started to call me a girl, and that was the first attack in fourth or fifth grade,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the first thing I recognized as people bullying me and questioning who I am because of their attacks and insecurities.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPostAfter dramatic stints on Broadway and prestige television, Michael Hsu Rosen is relishing the chance to celebrate silliness with his new series role. The actor stars alongside Emily Osment and Gregg Sulkin in \u201cPretty Smart,\u201d which debuted on Netflix this month. The 10-episode comedy follows Chelsea (played by Osment), a East Coast intellectual and aspiring author who relocates to California and moves in with her once-estranged sister, Claire (Olivia Macklin), and an eccentric trio of Angelenos for what she thinks will be a brief stay. In true sitcom fashion, Chelsea\u2019s living situation becomes permanent after her boyfriend breaks up with her over the phone. This unexpected turn of events forces her to reconnect with Claire and, over time, let her guard down around her new roommates, each of whom embodies a West Coast archetype: social media influencer Jayden (Rosen), lawyer-turned-healer Solana (Cinthya Carmona) and hunky fitness trainer Grant (Sulkin). \u201cWe\u2019re living in a very serious time, so we need to be thoughtful,\u201d Rosen told HuffPost. \u201cBut we also need lightness, and I think this show is a welcome relief. Jayden may center himself in most spaces, but he\u2019s also a really good friend. He\u2019s the kind of person you want to tell good news to. He can get excited for you, and I like to think I do that, too.\u201dMuch like \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d \u201cPretty Smart\u201d is told in broad comedic strokes. Still, there are moments that hint at the vulnerability behind Jayden\u2019s Instagram-curated facade. One such scene appears in the show\u2019s fourth episode, in which the character reflects on his adolescent struggles with his gay identity and delivers a moving speech about the value of queer-inclusive spaces. Rosen, who is gay and half-Chinese, is also proud of the Episode 8 appearance of actor Ming-Na Wen as Jayden\u2019s mother, Jasmine, calling it \u201ca very big deal for me and for my family.\u201d He passed as Latino in many of his early roles, having having made his Broadway debut in the 2009 revival of \u201cWest Side Story\u201d as Federico. Notably, he appeared as \u201cMichael Rosen\u201d in the musical\u2019s playbill.By the time Rosen joined the cast of Broadway\u2019s \u201cTorch Song\u201d in 2018, he\u2019d added his Asian middle name to his stage and screen credits. Though he believes he was subsequently passed over for several roles, he has no regrets about making the change. \u201cI didn\u2019t work for a year and a half after I made that decision,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I realized there was a point where I wanted to make it clear to the industry what my background is so that there was no ambiguity. I had to put my foot down and say, \u2018This is who I am. This is how I\u2019d like to be represented.\u2019\u201d\u201cBeing half-Chinese, half-white, and gay ... there\u2019s still no A-list star for me to look to and say, \u2018Hey, they\u2019re like me. I\u2019ll do what they did,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cAt times that\u2019s been discouraging, but I think for the most part, it\u2019s empowering. I get to make my own way.\u201d \u201cPretty Smart\u201d is Rosen\u2019s second Netflix project following 2020\u2019s \u201cTiny Pretty Things,\u201d in which he got to showcase his years of ballet training as a dancer with a dark side. He also had a small but memorable role as Jimmy, one of Jonathan Groff\u2019s paramours, in the 2016 wrap-up movie of HBO\u2019s \u201cLooking,\u201d about the lives and loves of three gay men in San Francisco. \u201cThere\u2019s still no A-list star for me to look to and say, \u2018Hey, they\u2019re like me. I\u2019ll do what they did.\u2019 At times that\u2019s been discouraging, but I think for the most part, it\u2019s empowering.\u201dNoting that his \u201cLooking,\u201d \u201cTorch Song\u201d and \u201cPretty Smart\u201d characters represent gay men at very different points in their lives, Rosen is confident he\u2019ll be able to find the nuances in his future roles, even if they happen to also be queer. Though \u201cPretty Smart\u201d has not yet been renewed for a second season, he\u2019s hopeful the show\u2019s writers will delve deeper into Jayden\u2019s gay identity by giving the character a boyfriend or, at least, allowing his romantic side to shine in future episodes. \u201c[Sexuality is] both the most important thing about somebody and the least important, and that complexity needs to be represented,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cI want queer cinema that\u2019s self-consciously queer and deliberately queer, and I want queer cinema that\u2019s mainstream and commercial. I know that there\u2019s room for both.\u201d \u201cPretty Smart\u201d is now streaming on Netflix.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostThe issue of safety on the sets of Hollywood films was launched into the national conversation this week after Alec Baldwin pulled the trigger on a prop gun that killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins while filming an indie Western, \u201cRust,\u201d at a New Mexico movie ranch.The film\u2019s director, Joel Souza, was also hit during the incident but is recovering in a Santa Fe hospital. He said he was \u201cgutted\u201d by the loss of Hutchins in a statement issued to Deadline on Saturday.\u201cShe was kind, vibrant, incredibly talented, fought for every inch, and always pushed me to be better,\u201d the director said.Baldwin also expressed shock, saying Friday that his \u201cheart is broken\u201d for Hutchins\u2019 loved ones. He was photographed Saturday leaving a Santa Fe hotel with her husband, Matt Hutchins, and their young son, whom the actor hugged before parting ways. Here\u2019s what we know about what happened, how it happened, and what is being done to prevent future tragedies like it.Baldwin was acting out a gunfight at the time, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing production notes that said Baldwin was supposed to back out of a church and withdraw a gun from a holster. While the film crew would normally watch the scene from a distance, the L.A. Times said, Hutchins was still lining up her next camera shot with Souza and one other person. Baldwin reportedly pulled the gun out of its holster once without incident, but the second time, it discharged.Hutchins was hit in the chest and Souza in the shoulder. The cinematographer was airlifted by helicopter to a hospital, but died of the injury. Many elements of the incident remain unclear, including what type of gun was used, what type of projectile hit the crew, how many projectiles there were, who had prepared the gun for use on set and whether or not that person followed safety protocols. Weapons on movie sets are supposed to be managed by an armorer \u2015 someone with experience handling guns who knows the difference between live ammo and blanks. Both consist of a cartridge filled with gunpowder, but a live round has a projectile on the tip, whereas a blank does not. But even blanks can be deadly if fired at close range. One experienced prop master told CNBC that usually, for shots where an actor aims a gun directly at the camera, ballistics shields are set up between the gun and the crew, just in case. Unionized Hollywood workers are broadly frustrated with the state of their industry. Nearly 60,000 people affiliated with the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts \u2015 or IATSE \u2015 threatened to walk off the job earlier this week if their demands concerning their schedules, health and safety were not addressed. Their union managed to avert a strike for now, but frustrations still remain.Several outlets have reported that at least six unionized crew members walked off the set of the film just hours before the deadly shooting in protest of working conditions. The camera crew was upset about the long commute \u2014 having believed they would be provided hotel rooms near the set \u2014 and about having to wait weeks for their paychecks. The film has a very modest budget of $7 million. Crucially, the workers had also reportedly voiced concerns that safety protocols were not being followed on set, according to the Los Angeles Times and The Associated Press. They were particularly alarmed because someone had allegedly fired two rounds by accident in the days leading up to Thursday\u2019s tragedy. A third accidental discharge had taken place even earlier, according to the L.A. Times. \u201cThere were no safety meetings. There was no assurance that it wouldn\u2019t happen again. All they wanted to do was rush, rush, rush,\u201d one crew member told the newspaper. A text message from a crew member before Hutchins\u2019 death reportedly complained of the conditions: \u201cThis is super unsafe.\u201d A source told The Daily Beast that the armorer who was allegedly on set at the time, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was only 24 and lacked experience to maintain a safe environment.Police are still investigating, and no charges have been brought. IATSE Local 44, which covers prop masters, sent an email to members saying the \u201cRust\u201d prop master was not a Local 44 member, IndieWire reported. It is not clear what kind of background the prop master had. Baldwin did not know the prop gun contained a live round, according to records from the Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office obtained by news outlets including The Washington Post.An assistant director, Dave Halls, took the gun off a cart, handed it to Baldwin and yelled, \u201ccold gun,\u201d according to the AP. (\u201cCold\u201d means that the weapon did not have live ammunition and was therefore safe.)A record of script supervisor Mamie Mitchell\u2019s subsequent 911 call illustrates the panic that ensued: \u201cWe had two people accidentally shot on a move set by a prop gun, we need help immediately,\u201d she told the dispatcher. \u201cWe were rehearsing and it went off, and I ran out, we all ran out.\u201dAsked whether the gun fired a real bullet, Mitchell said, \u201cI cannot tell you. We have two injuries. And this [expletive] AD [assistant director] that yelled at me at lunch, asking about revisions ... He\u2019s supposed to check the guns. He\u2019s responsible for what happens on the set.\u201d An affidavit stated that the assistant director did not know the prop gun was loaded with live rounds, The New York Times reported.The Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office told the Times it hopes to have more information to share early next week.Hutchins, 42, was born in Ukraine and grew up on a Soviet military base in the Arctic Circle, where she was \u201csurrounded by reindeer and nuclear submarines,\u201d according to her website. She was just starting to make a name for herself in the industry, having worked on independent films including \u201cThe Mad Hatter,\u201d created by Armando Gutierrez, and \u201cArchenemy,\u201d featuring Joe Manganiello.In 2019, she was selected as one of American Cinematographer\u2019s rising stars. Mitchell, the 911 caller, told the AP in an interview, \u201cThis woman is gone at the beginning of her career. She was an extraordinary, rare, very rare woman.\u201dMatt Hutchins, her husband, reflected on her life over social media. \u201cOur loss is enormous,\u201d he wrote Saturday.Halyna inspired us all with her passion and vision, and her legacy is too meaningful to encapsulate in words.  Our loss is enormous, and we ask that the media please respect my family\u2019s privacy as we process our grief.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostThe mental health nonprofit that Jamie Lynn Spears had pledged a donation with proceeds from her upcoming memoir has declined to accept the contribution after an outcry by Britney Spears supporters. Fans of the singer aren\u2019t exactly thrilled that the younger Spears sister is peddling her book \u201cThings I Should Have Said\u201d during the pop superstar\u2019s painful struggle to break free from her conservatorship.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPostAdele has confirmed the release date for her hotly anticipated fourth album, assuring hopeful fans that, yes, \u201csad girl fall\u201d will materialize this year. The singer-songwriter announced Wednesday on social media that \u201c30\u201d will arrive Nov. 19. She also posted a photo of what many believe is the cover image for the album, showing a close-up of her face in side profile. In a note included in the post, Adele said she\u2019d \u201clearned a lot of blistering home truths\u201d about herself during the recording process of \u201c30,\u201d which \u2015 like her previous albums \u2015 refers to the age she was at the time she composed the songs. Incidentally, the new music will be unveiled just one day short of the fifth anniversary of \u201c25,\u201d her third album. \u201cIt was my ride or die throughout the most turbulent period of my life,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen I was writing it, it was my friend who came over with a bottle of wine and a takeaway to cheer me up. My wise friend who always gives the best advice.\u201d\u201cAnd then that friend who no matter what, checked in on me even though I\u2019d stopped checking in with them because I\u2019d become so consumed by my own grief,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ve painstakingly rebuilt my house and my heart since then and this album narrates it. Home is where the heart is.\u201dBy all accounts, \u201c30\u201d looks poised to be one of the biggest music releases of the year. Its debut will be preceded by the first single, \u201cEasy on Me,\u201d due out on Friday. A Vogue cover story published last week described the track as \u201ca gut-wrenching plea of a piano ballad.\u201dAnd according to Vulture, Adele is considering a live concert special on a television network or streaming platform timed to the album\u2019s release, though no specifics have thus far been finalized. The singer\u2019s reference to a \u201cturbulent period\u201d appeared to be purposefully vague. In the years since the 2015 release of \u201c25,\u201d however, she married \u2015 and divorced \u2015 entrepreneur Simon Konecki, with whom she shares a 9-year-son, Angelo. And in August of last year, she faced widespread backlash after sharing a photo of herself attending London\u2019s Notting Hill Carnival in a Jamaican flag bikini and her hair styled in Bantu knots, prompting accusations of cultural appropriation. Speaking to British Vogue, Adele revealed she\u2019d written much of \u201c30\u201d for Angelo, whom she said has had \u201creally good questions, really innocent questions, that I just don\u2019t have an answer for.\u201d \u201cI just felt like I wanted to explain to him, through this record, when he\u2019s in his 20s or 30s, who I am and why I voluntarily chose to dismantle his entire life in the pursuit of my own happiness,\u201d she explained last week. \u201cIt made him really unhappy sometimes.

He called the mandate discriminatory, defying British Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s order that concert sites and nightclubs require proof of inoculation. He later appeared to create an anti-vaccine song.Clapton received two AstraZeneca vaccine doses, but said he suffered \u201cdisastrous\u201d weekslong side effects.He recently appeared to break his vow of canceling shows that require vaccination.

McCartney\u2019s comments were first reported by The Observer.When asked by interviewer John Wilson about the decision to strike out on his own, McCartney retorted: \u201cStop right there. I am not the person who instigated the split. Oh no, no, no. John walked into a room one day and said, \u2018I am leaving The Beatles.\u2019 Is that instigating the split, or not?\u201dMcCartney expressed sadness over the breakup, saying the group was still making \u201cpretty good stuff.\u201d\u201cThis was my band, this was my job, this was my life. So I wanted it to continue,\u201d McCartney said.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostThe judge overseeing the conservatorship of Britney Spears issued a bombshell ruling Wednesday suspending the singer\u2019s father as one of her conservators effective immediately, members of the media present in the courtroom reported.The pop star\u2019s lawyer, Matthew Rosengart, on Wednesday asked Judge Brenda Penny to immediately remove her father, Jamie Spears, as a conservator and replace him with a new one, accusing him of \u201cunfathomable\u201d abuse toward his daughter, including eavesdropping on her private conversations.\u201cBritney deserves to wake up tomorrow without her father as her conservator,\u201d Rosengart said Wednesday, calling Jamie Spears a \u201ccruel, toxic and abusive man.\u201dEnding the legal arrangement \u201cis in the best interest of the conservatee,\u201d Penny decided after more than an hour of hearing arguments from lawyers for both Britney Spears and her father. Now, for the first time since the conservatorship was established 13 years ago, the 39-year-old singer is allowed to live without her father\u2019s supervision.Outside the hearing at Los Angeles Superior Court, a throng of Britney Spears\u2019 supporters gathered to wait for the news, and celebrated when Penny decided in her favor. Footage from outside the courthouse when news broke out that Jamie Spears was officially suspended! #FreeBritney pic.twitter.com/p1Ze9IVzrwJamie Spears\u2019 legal team, meanwhile, called for the immediate suspension of the conservatorship all together. Rosengart pushed back on that, calling for a separate hearing on that matter in several weeks\u2019 time.Key to Rosengart\u2019s strategy is that in the event of her father\u2019s replacement, several private documents about the nature of the conservatorship would be handed over to the new conservator, potentially exposing the full scale of Jamie Spears\u2019 treatment of his daughter.Penny appointed John Zabel, a certified public accountant selected by Britney Spears, as Jamie Spears\u2019 temporary replacement. Rosengart, whom Britney Spears hired in July, has also accused her father of trying to extort $2 million from his daughter in exchange for stepping down from the conservatorship. Up until recently, Jamie Spears maintained that the conservatorship was necessary to protect his \u201cmentally sick\u201d daughter. Rosengart has said he believes his client\u2019s father changed his tune in order to \u201cavoid accountability and justice\u201d regarding the extortion claims. Britney Spears has been under the control of a conservatorship since 2008 after she was hospitalized for a psychiatric evaluation, but many details of the arrangement have remained under wraps until recently. In June, she spoke before the court in an effort to end the conservatorship, which she says allows her father and other conservators complete control over her career, personal decisions and finances. \u201cI\u2019ve been in denial. I\u2019ve been in shock. I am traumatized,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, fake it till you make it. But now I\u2019m telling you the truth, OK? I\u2019m not happy. I can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m so angry it\u2019s insane. And I\u2019m depressed. I cry every day.\u201dIn her 24-minute testimony, she alleged that her conservators blocked her from marrying her boyfriend and forced her to get an IUD, upending her wishes to have another child. She also alleges that they had her put on lithium, a strong mood-stabilizing drug, when they deemed her uncooperative at rehearsals for a series of Las Vegas shows that, by her telling, her conservators forced her to agree to. The pop icon has also reportedly paid out millions in salaries, office space and other costs for the conservators. Though Jamie Spears voluntarily stepped down as the conservator of his daughter\u2019s person in 2019 and replaced himself with professional conservator Jodi Montgomery, he continued as conservator of her estate until Wednesday\u2019s court ruling.Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostDemi Lovato once saw a UFO but didn\u2019t find the experience alienating at all, the entertainer said.Lovato, who uses they/them pronouns, talked to E! News on Monday about sighting what they described as a floating blue orb last October at Joshua Tree National Park.\u201cI basically saw this blue orb that was about 50 feet away, maybe less, and it was kind of like floating above the ground, just like 10 or 15 feet, and it was kind of keeping its distance from me,\u201d Lovato said. \u201cIt was a beautiful and incredible experience.\u201d \u201cIt definitely changed the way that you see the world,\u201d they added. \u201cYou have an inkling and then all of a sudden that inkling is confirmed. It changes your reality, for sure.\u201d One way it has changed Lovato\u2019s life: The singer is now exploring the UFO phenomenon in \u201cUnidentified With Demi Lovato,\u201d a reality series debuting Thursday on Peacock.Although Lovato conceded that it would be normal to \u201cfreak out\u201d over seeing a UFO, what they \u201cfound in these experiences is the love, and there\u2019s no fear,\u201d they told EW.com.Lovato added: \u201cThe feeling that you get from these beings is so warm and loving and accepting that it\u2019s just overwhelming joy that happens when you\u2019re able to make contact.\u201dBut the singer wanted to be clear about what \u201ccontact\u201d means.\u201cWhen I say make contact, I just mean intentionally try to meditate and try to manifest sightings,\u201d Lovato told the website. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m actually, like, shaking hands with these beings \u2014 although I would love that. I think these beings are extremely peaceful and loving and when they show up, you can absolutely feel that concept.\u201dLovato is hoping \u201cUnidentified\u201d inspires people to look at the UFO culture in a new way.\u201cI feel like it\u2019s so important also to talk about this because it raises our consciousness,\u201d Lovato told ETOnline. \u201cIt expands our consciousness and that is what we have to do in order to make this world a better place.\u201d Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostWill Smith says the worldwide reckoning with racism that occurred in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death has been mostly positive \u2015 but he thinks it could use better branding.\u201cThe entire world was in lockdown, watched what happened to George Floyd, and stood up with one voice and said, We see it. We agree,\u201d Smith told GQ magazine in a profile published Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s never happened before and with that the opportunities are unlike they\u2019ve ever been.\u201dCase in point: \u201cEmancipation,\u201d Smith\u2019s upcoming Civil War-era epic for Apple TV. The movie, directed by Antoine Fuqua, tells the story of \u201cWhipped Peter,\u201d an enslaved man who was the subject of one of the most widely circulated images of slavery of its time.\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to get movies made for a long time. And the amount of money that Apple is paying to tell the story [of \u2018Emancipation\u2019] is unprecedented,\u201d Smith said. \u201cAnd those opportunities are globally present and plentiful.\u201dEarlier this year, Smith also produced and hosted the six-part Netflix docuseries \u201cAmend,\u201d which focused on the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and offered a close look at the history of racial oppression in America, among other subjects.Still, Smith worries that Black Americans could be making more of this moment.\u201cI just want to encourage Black Americans to take the acknowledgment and seize upon the present global opportunities,\u201d he told GQ. \u201cI would just like us to argue less about certain things and pay attention to the big ripe fruit.\u201dSmith, who has spoken in the past about his own experiences with police racism, said he thinks certain terms, like \u201cdefund the police\u201d and \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d could use different language to make them better understood to people outside the community.\u201c\u2018Abolish the police. Defund the police.\u2019 I would love if we would just say \u2018Defund the bad police.\u2019 It\u2019s almost like I want, as Black Americans, for us to change our marketing for the new position we\u2019re in. So \u2018critical race theory,\u2019 just call it \u2018truth theory,\u2019\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe pendulum is swinging in our direction beautifully. And there\u2019s a certain humility that will most capitalize on the moment for the future of Black Americans, without discounting the difficulty and the pain and the emotion.\u201cThis is a difficult area to discuss, but I feel like the simplicity of Black Lives Matter was perfect,\u201d he said. \u201cAnybody who tries to debate Black Lives Matter looks ridiculous. So when I talk about the marketing of our ideas, Black Lives Matter was perfection.\u201dBy comparison, he argued, \u201c\u2018Defund the police\u2019 doesn\u2019t get it done, no matter how good the ideas are.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t defund the police.

The Musical\u201d that ultimately came out on top. After sweeping the technical categories early in the telecast, \u201cMoulin Rouge\u201d scored a best direction trophy for Alex Timber and a featured acting Tony for Danny Burstein. Then \u2015 unsurprisingly, since he was the only one nominated in the category \u2015 Aaron Tveit won for best leading actor in a musical. And when it came time hand out the best musical award, \u201cMoulin Rogue\u201d once again trounced its competition.As for plays, Jeremy O. Harris\u2019 \u201cSlave Play\u201d was poised to dominate after amassing 12 nominations, the most for any play in the history of the Tonys, but in the end it was completely shut out at the ceremony. Instead, the two-part AIDS drama \u201cThe Inheritance,\u201d inspired by E.M. Forster\u2019s \u201cHowards End,\u201d took home four trophies, including a surprise win for best play.The much-delayed show spanned four hours across two separate televised events taking place live at New York City\u2019s Winter Garden Theater. Dubbed \u201cThe Tony Awards Present: Broadway\u2019s Back,\u201d this year\u2019s ceremony began with an awards presentation streamed on Paramount+, followed by a two-hour concert special where the night\u2019s top three prizes \u2015 best play revival, best play and best musical \u2015 were unveiled on CBS.To guide viewers through the admittedly confusing affair, previous winners Leslie Odom Jr. and Audra McDonald \u2014 who was also nominated this year for best leading actress in a play \u2014 hosted the show.This year\u2019s Tonys were engineered to celebrate more than just a Broadway season cut short. The show also featured a slate of nostalgia-inducing performances, in addition to the numbers highlighting the casts of each nominated musical. There was Jennifer Holliday honoring the 40th anniversary of \u201cDreamgirls\u201d; a John Legend-assisted number with the company of \u201cAin\u2019t Too Proud\u201d; a reunion of the cast of \u201cHairspray\u201d; the stylings of Miranda\u2019s \u201cFreestyle Love Supreme\u201d group; and Idina Menzel belting her heart out alongside \u201cWicked\u201d co-star Kristin Chenoweth.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostBritney Spears\u2019 father, Jamie Spears, hired a security company that monitored her digital communications and went so far as to secretly capture audio recordings from her bedroom, according to a New York Times documentary released Friday.The audio \u2015 more than 180 hours\u2019 worth \u2015 allegedly recorded conversations the pop star had with her boyfriend and her children, said Alex Vlasov, a former employee of the company Black Box who spoke with the Times for its \u201cNew York Times Presents\u201d series on Hulu.\u201cJust because you\u2019re in control, doesn\u2019t give you the right to treat people like property,\u201d Vlasov said in the hourlong program. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like she was being treated like a human being.\u201d At another point, he told the Times that it felt like the security team surrounding Britney Spears was like a \u201cprison.\u201dThe singer told a court investigator in 2016 that she could not even make friends with people \u2015 \u201cespecially men\u201d \u2015 unless they were approved by her father, according to a copy of the report obtained by The New York Times.\u201cThere was an obsession with the men in Britney\u2019s life,\u201d Vlasov said in the documentary.While her father\u2019s level of control over her life has drawn sharp scrutiny, details on the inner workings of Spears\u2019 conservatorship have remained shrouded in secrecy. The legal arrangement was put in place in 2008 out of concern for the star\u2019s mental health and gave her conservators \u2015 including her father \u2015 final approval on where she could go, what she could buy and what medical treatments she received, among other personal freedoms.Security even doled out the singer\u2019s medication to her, according to Vlasov.It is not clear how many of the security measures were approved by the Los Angeles Superior Court over the last 13 years.Vlasov started at Black Box as a personal assistant to its founder, Edan Yemini, whose company\u2019s website says that he was trained in the Israeli Defense Forces. Among his regular duties, Vlasov said, he was allegedly asked to encrypt Spears\u2019 messages that were mirrored onto an iPad logged into her iCloud account so Yemini could give them to Jamie Spears and Robin Greenhill, an executive at Tri Star Sports & Entertainment who helped manage the singer\u2019s career.\u201cEdan would say, \u2018She\u2019s just like a child, like any minor, who needs their parent\u2019s consent,\u2019\u201d Vlasov said.He said in the documentary that he felt ethically conflicted by the job and confident in his decision to speak publicly.At one point in his employment, in 2016, Vlasov said that Yemini handed him a USB drive with audio recordings from Britney Spears\u2019 bedroom and asked him to delete the contents.\u201cI had them tell me what was on it,\u201d Vlasov said in the documentary. \u201cThey seemed very nervous and said that it was extremely sensitive, that nobody can ever know about this and that\u2019s why I need to delete everything on it, so there\u2019s no record of it.\u201dHe continued: \u201cThat raised so many red flags with me and I did not want to be complicit in whatever they were involved in, so I kept a copy, because I don\u2019t want to delete evidence.\u201dA former wardrobe manager, Tish Yates, alleged that it was Greenhill whom she saw exercise an alarming amount of control over the singer.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostDespite his attempts to promote a movie that he\u2019s actually in, every recent interview with Andrew Garfield has eventually devolved into a discussion about whether he\u2019ll appear in the upcoming \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home.\u201dThe British actor played the web-slinger in two \u201cAmazing Spider-Man\u201d films before Tom Holland assumed the superhero role. It has been rumored for months that all three Peter Parkers \u2015 Holland, Garfield and Tobey Maguire, who starred in the original \u201cSpider-Man\u201d trilogy \u2015 will appear the forthcoming sequel, which unleashes the multiverse and a slew of familiar villains from prior films.Garfield has repeatedly shot down reports that he\u2019ll reprise his role in \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home,\u201d but fans are still convinced that he\u2019ll suit up as Spidey once again. During an appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d on Monday, Garfield addressed an alleged leaked photo, which has since been scrubbed from the internet, that appears to show him on the set of the film.\u201cI heard about it. And I did see it. And it\u2019s a Photoshop,\u201d Garfield told host Jimmy Fallon, who jokingly insisted he was \u201cpretty sure\u201d the actor was involved in the project. \u201cI am trying to manage expectations.\u201d\u201cI think that Tom Holland is just the perfect Peter Parker and Spider-Man, so I am super stoked,\u201d Garfield said. \u201cI get to just be a fan again, which is my preferred position. To be able to sit in the audience and kind of go, \u2018Yeah, you screwed up, mate. You didn\u2019t do it as well as you could have done, eh?\u2019 I get to be that guy that\u2019s just like, \u2018Yeah, I don\u2019t really love the suit.\u2019\u201dGarfield also strongly denied playing any role in \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d in an interview with Variety earlier this month, stating in no uncertain terms that he\u2019s not \u201cinvolved in\u201d the sequel. \u201cI understand why people are freaking out about the concept of that because I\u2019m a fan as well,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but imagine scenes and moments of \u2018Oh, my God, how fucking cool would it be if they did that?\u2019 But it\u2019s important for me to say on the record that this is not something I\u2019m aware I am involved in.\u201d \u201cBut I know I\u2019m not going to be able to say anything that will convince anyone that I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening,\u201d he added. \u201cNo matter what I say, I\u2019m fucked. It\u2019s either going to be really disappointing for people or it\u2019s going to be really exciting.\u201dHe also addressed the rumors in May, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t speak for anything else but for myself. They might be doing something, but I ain\u2019t got a call.\u201dIn the first trailer for \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d released last month, Peter Parker accidentally tinkers with Doctor Strange\u2019s spell, creating a rift that brings out big-bads from previous films, including Alfred Molina\u2019s Doc Ock and Jamie Foxx\u2019s Electro. It\u2019ll be the first time that Spider-Man won\u2019t be \u201cable to separate his normal life from the high-stakes of being a Super Hero,\u201d according to the film\u2019s synopsis.With or without Garfield, \u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\u201d hits theaters on Dec. 17.Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPostThe Met Gala has been synonymous with outrageous fashion that often makes a broader statement about inclusion \u2015 and, for attendees Dan Levy and Nikkie de Jager, this year was no exception. Levy, one of the first stars to appear on the red carpet Monday night, wore a custom-designed outfit by Spanish fashion house Loewe that featured puffed sleeves and an etching of two men kissing across the front. He accessorized the look with jewels from Cartier.The \u201cSchitt\u2019s Creek\u201d co-creator and star said he and designer Jonathan Anderson wanted the colorful ensemble to \u201ccelebrate queer love and visibility.\u201d The image itself is \u201cFuck You Faggot Fucker\u201d by artist David Wojnarovicz, who died of an AIDS-related illness in 1992. Wojnarovicz used old maps to create \u201cFuck You Faggot Fucker\u201d in 1984, and named the now-iconic piece after a homophobic cartoon he\u2019d found on the street. As for Levy and Anderson, the pair wanted to present the work \u201cin a way that offered a hopeful message\u201d instead. \u201cTonight, we\u2019re celebrating the resilience, the love, and the joy of the community while honoring a crucial American voice that was taken from us too soon,\u201d Levy wrote on Instagram Monday, adding that Loewe had also contributed to Visual AIDS, an HIV/AIDS advocacy organization that Wojnarovicz supported during his lifetime. As for de Jager, the makeup artist and YouTube personality wore a floor-length teal gown by Edwin Oudshoorn Couture, as well as a floral headdress. The look, she explained, was a tribute to Marsha P. Johnson, a Black transgender activist and prominent figure in the 1969 Stonewall uprising. A sash adorned to the bottom of the skirt read \u201cPay it no mind,\u201d which was Johnson\u2019s response to questions about her gender. \u201cI knew I wanted to pay homage to a trans icon who was at the forefront of the Stonewall Riots,\u201d de Jager, who is transgender, wrote on Instagram. \u201cMarsha P. Johnson paved the way for so many of us, and I hope I made my community proud tonight.\u201dJohnson died in 1992 at the age of 46 under mysterious circumstances. Her body was recovered from New York\u2019s Hudson River. Though police initially said she died by suicide, her cause of death was later changed to \u201cundetermined.\u201d Earlier on Monday, de Jager laid a bouquet of flowers at the spot where Johnson\u2019s body was found. Levy and de Jager were among the many LGBTQ stars to appear at the 2021 Met Gala, which celebrated the Costume Institute\u2019s new exhibit, \u201cIn America: A Lexicon of Fashion.\u201dAmong those also turning heads were Cara Delevingne, who wore a bulletproof Dior vest emblazoned with the phrase \u201cPeg the Patriarchy,\u201d and Lil Nas X, who was styled by Hodo Musa and opted for not one, not two, but three jaw-dropping looks.

Barker is both presenting at the ceremony and performing his new single, \u201cpapercuts,\u201d alongside frequent collaborator Machine Gun Kelly.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostAfter a string of buzzy awards show performances over the past year \u2014 and ahead of the release of his debut album \u201cMontero\u201d later this month \u2014 the question wasn\u2019t if, but how Lil Nas X  would raise the bar at the 2021 MTV Music Video Awards on Sunday. The Grammy winner did that and then some with a recreation of his \u201cIndustry Baby\u201d music video, including the now-infamous prison shower scene in which the nearly naked singer quite literally wipes the floor with the help of some fellow inmates. A triumphant Lil Nas X \u2014 after an introduction from \u201cPose\u201d star Billy Porter, who noted that the world wasn\u2019t always welcoming to \u201cBlack boy joy\u201d \u2014 appeared on stage at the head of a neon pink-hued drum line with his album\u2019s name emblazoned across his chest. Before long, he stripped off the uniform and marched into the \u201cMontero State Prison,\u201d which was modeled off the set of his music video, and was joined by a group of masked backup dancers. After an assist from rapper Jack Harlowe, who appeared on stage in an all-leather outfit, it was time for a trip to the communal showers. There, Lil Nas X stripped down to pink boxer briefs before performing a snippet of his single \u201cMontero (Call Me by Your Name).\u201dThe VMAs performance is the latest in a long line of unapologetic displays from Lil Nas X in recent months. At the BET Awards in June, he kissed one of his male backup dancers (rumored boyfriend Yai Ariza) on stage.And then there was his stripper-pole routine during his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d debut, which resulted in the singer ripping his pants mid-song.Leading up to the show, Lil Nas X even announced he was pregnant with the new album in a maternity-style photoshoot complete with an oversized belly and flower crown. Predictably, the stunt fielded plenty of criticism, but the singer used the attention to create a \u201cbaby registry\u201d that encourages fans to donate to social causes, including nonprofit organizations benefitting LGBTQ and Black communities.\u201cThe pandemic helped me get out of the idea of trying to please everybody, and the idea of \u2018He\u2019s a cool gay person; he\u2019s an acceptable gay person,\u2019\u201d the artist told Variety. \u201cI used to see things like that as a compliment, but it\u2019s not. It just means you\u2019re a people pleaser, and they never become legends.\u201d\u201cI wanted to be even more authentic in my music and let people into my life,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m much more confident now \u2014 in my music, myself, my sexuality, the things that I believe that I stand for.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostLady Gaga\u2019s impressive array of face masks aside, last year\u2019s COVID-impacted MTV Video Music Awards is best forgotten as just another underwhelming virtual awards show.But the ceremony returned to its former glory with an in-person event airing live from the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, on Sunday night, where revamped Moon Person trophies rained down upon some of the biggest names in music. The 2021 ceremony hosted by Doja Cat, who took home the Best New Artist trophy last year, featured 14 gender-neutral categories across musical genres and a star-studded slate of performers.Heading into the night, Justin Bieber led the pack with seven nominations and ultimately took home prizes in major categories, including Artist of the Year and Best Pop. Newly anointed Grammy royalty Megan Thee Stallion trailed closely behind with six nods of her own, including four for her anthem \u201cWAP,\u201d but failed to gain much traction at the ceremony. Artists Cardi B, Billie Eilish, BTS, Drake, Lil Nas X, Doja Cat and Olivia Rodrigo each earned five noms apiece. Rodrigo, who delivered a camera-shattering performance of \u201cGood 4 U\u201d early in the show, won multiple awards, including Best New Artist and Song of The Year for her chart-topping ballad \u201cDrivers License.\u201dBut Lil Nas X managed to take home the night\u2019s top award \u2014 Video of the Year \u2014 for his controversy-sparking \u201cMontero (Call Me By Your Name)\u201d music video, and he thanked the \u201cgay agenda\u201d in his acceptance speech. The Foo Fighters, who scored three nominations this year, were also honored with the first-ever U.S. Global Icon Award.Big-name acts Lorde and Nicki Minaj pulled out days before the show, but plenty of stars still performed at the ceremony, including Bieber, Alicia Keys, Normani, Chl\u00f6e, Camila Cabello, Shawn Mendes, Ed Sheeran, Kacey Musgraves, Busta Rhymes and Twenty One Pilots. Lil Nas X also took the stage, making a name for himself in the VMA history books with a steamy recreation of his latest music video. Billy Porter, Kourtney Kardashian, Ashanti, Megan Fox, Hailey Bieber, Avril Lavigne, Ciara, Ja Rule, Simone Biles, SZA and Lance Bass were among the famous faces who presented awards throughout the night.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 On what\u2019s traditionally one of the sleepiest weekends at the movies, the Marvel film \u201cShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\u201d smashed the record for Labor Day openings with an estimated $71.4 million in ticket sales, giving a box office reeling from the recent coronavirus surge a huge lift heading into the fall season.The Friday-to-Sunday gross for \u201cShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,\u201d Marvel\u2019s first film led by an Asian superhero, ranks as one of the best debuts of the pandemic, trailing only the previous Marvel film, \u201cBlack Widow\u201d ($80.3 million in July) and Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cF9\u201d ($70 million in June). Overseas, it pulled in $56.2 million for a global three-day haul of $127.6 million. Disney anticipates \u201cShang Chi,\u201d made for about $150 million, will add $12.1 million domestically on Monday.The Walt Disney Co. opted to release \u201cShang-Chi\u201d only in theaters where it will have an exclusive 45-day run. Some of the studio\u2019s releases this year, including \u201cBlack Widow,\u201d have premiered day-and-date in theaters and on Disney+ for $30.The strong opening of \u201cShang-Chi\u201d \u2014 forecasts had been closer to $50 million \u2014 was a major relief for Hollywood, which had seen jittery releases the last few weeks during rising COVID-19 cases driven by the delta variant. Several upcoming films have recently postponed out of the fall, including Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cTop Gun: Maverick,\u201d \u201cJackass Forever\u201d and \u201cClifford the Big Red Dog.\u201d Disney\u2019s weekend, though, should lend confidence to upcoming big-budget releases such as the James Bond film \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d from MGM and United Artists Releasing, and Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cVenom: Let There Be Carnage.\u201d\u201c\u2018Shang-Chi\u2019 is the ultimate confidence-builder for the theatrical movie industry,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore. \u201cThis was a very important film. This was the Marvel movie that\u2019s opened exclusively theatrically since \u2018Spider-Man: Far From Home\u2019 in July 2019. \u2018Shang-Chi\u2019 is a real testament of the power of a theatrical-first strategy to drive huge numbers of moviegoers to the multiplex.\u201dPerhaps nobody will be celebrating Sunday more than theater owners. Exhibitors have argued day-and-date releases significantly cannibalize ticket sales. Warner Bros., which is putting all of its 2021 releases simultaneously on HBO Max, has vowed to end the practice next year.Adding to that argument is the continuing strong performance of \u201cFree Guy,\u201d from Disney\u2019s 20th Century Studios. \u201cFree Guy,\u201d contractually obligated to be released only in theaters, has grossed $239.2 million globally. Without an in-home option, the Ryan Reynolds film has held especially strongly; it added $8.7 million in North America over the weekend, good for third place. In China, \u201cFree Guy\u201d has made $57 million in less than two weeks. (\u201cShang-Chi\u201d doesn\u2019t yet have a China release date.)Last week\u2019s top film, the Universal horror remake \u201cCandyman,\u201d slid to second place with $10.5 million. After the holiday weekend, Universal pegs its two-week total at $41.9 million.Still, you could also read a case for streaming in Disney\u2019s figures Sunday. \u201cShang-Chi,\u201d the studio noted, premiered roughly similarly to \u201cBlack Widow,\u201d which debuted with about $160 million globally but took in an additional $60 million on Disney+ Premier Access. \u201cBlack Widow,\u201d a much more well-known property, launched before the delta variant was widespread in North America. Its release prompted a lawsuit from star Scarlett Johansson, who argued the day-and-date approach breached her contract and deprived her of potential earnings. Disney has said the release complied with Johansson\u2019s contract and called the suit without merit.Disney has so far declined to telegraph its future theatrical intentions, including for its next Marvel movie, \u201cEternals\u201d (due out Nov. 5). Bob Chapek, Disney\u2019s chief executive, earlier called the theatrical release of \u201cShang-Chi\u201d \u201can interesting experiment\u201d \u2014 a label that Canadian actor Simu Liu, who plays Shang-Chi took exception with. \u201cWe are not an experiment,\u201d Liu wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe are the underdog; the underestimated. We are the ceiling-breakers. We are the celebration of culture and joy that will persevere after an embattled year.\u201dAt the recent exhibitor convention CinemaCon, where some studios pledged faith in the big screen, Disney didn\u2019t make a presentation and instead simply screened \u201cShang-Chi.\u201d Directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, the film is based on a relatively little-known comic and features a largely Asian or Asian American cast, including Tony Leung, Awkwafina and Michelle Yeoh. Audiences and critics have heartily endorsed it. It has a 92% fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes and an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore from moviegoers.The success of \u201cShang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\u201d came on a typically quiet weekend for Hollywood \u2014 one that would never normally feature the premiere of a new Marvel movie.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostYou get what you give ... or at least that\u2019s what Evan Rachel Wood is hoping for when it comes to her ex Marilyn Manson, whom she accused of sexual assault along with at least a dozen other women.Days after Kanye West brought out the shock rocker at his final listening event ahead of the release of his new album, \u201cDonda,\u201d the \u201cWestworld\u201d star had a song of her own to sing. Taking the stage at Los Angeles\u2019 Bourbon Room on Saturday night, Wood performed a cover of the signature New Radicals track \u201cYou Get What You Give,\u201d which famously name-checks Manson as someone in need of a good ass-kicking. \u201cI\u2019ve been saving this but it seems like the appropriate time,\u201d Wood prefaced her performance with collaborator Zane Carney, whom she tours with as a band under the name Evan + Zane. When it came time to sing Manson\u2019s name, Wood put a middle finger up in defiance, with the crowd erupting in cheers before she closed out the number. (See the moment below at 4:45.) A post shared by Evan Rachel Wood (@evanrachelwood)Sharing a video from the show on Instagram Sunday, Wood said the performance was was dedicated to \u201cmy fellow survivors who got slapped in the face this week,\u201d presumably referencing West\u2019s recent, and very public, support of Manson. \u201cI love you. Don\u2019t give up,\u201d she wrote in the caption. After years of speaking out about being a victim of sexual assault and advocating for the rights of other survivors, Wood publicly named Manson as her abuser in February along with four other women.Wood alleged that Manson began \u201cgrooming\u201d her when she was a teenager and \u201chorrifically abused\u201d her for several years during their relationship in the mid-to-late 2000s.\u201cI was brainwashed and manipulated into submission,\u201d Wood wrote in an Instagram post at the time. \u201cI am done living in fear of retaliation, slander, or blackmail. I am here to expose this dangerous man and call out the many industries that have enabled him, before he ruins any more lives.\u201dSince then, many more women, including \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esm\u00e9 Bianco and comedian Charlyne Yi, have come forward with their own allegations against Manson, ranging from sexual assault and harassment to psychological abuse and verbal threats. Manson, who was recently charged with assaulting a photographer in 2019, has denied the allegations, calling them \u201chorrible distortions of reality.\u201dDespite the many accusations against him and an open investigation into various alleged incidents of domestic violence by the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department, Manson has seemingly found a friend in West as of late. After West brought Manson out onstage alongside rapper DaBaby \u2014 who\u2019s embroiled in his own controversy over recent homophobic comments \u2014 it was revealed that Manson is also featured as a co-writer on West\u2019s new album. Later in the weekend, Wood took a direct shot at West for working with her alleged abuser, writing in an Instagram Story, \u201cTriggered, re-traumatized, and unsafe,\u201d across a news article about their collaboration, according to People.Wood received plenty of support on her Instagram post, with friends and collaborators praising her strength in the comments.\u201cYou are a powerhouse warrior woman my sweet friend,\u201d Rumer Willis wrote.In a separate comment, Carney added, \u201cI love you and love that we learned this backstage 3 min before we played it.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostCall it your at-home Sunday Service: Kanye West\u2019s new album, \u201cDonda,\u201d is finally available for your listening pleasure on all streaming platforms. Weeks after its scheduled launch and multiple stadium-packing listening parties, the rapper released his 10th studio album on Sunday morning named in honor of his mother, Donda West, who died in 2007 following plastic surgery complications. West initially planned to drop the record in July 2020 before it was pushed back numerous times. The Grammy winner spent the past summer finishing the project and hosting multiple listening parties at venues across the country with the rapper even taking up residence at Atlanta\u2019s Mercedes-Benz Stadium at one point, as he continued working on the songs. Featuring a sprawling 27 tracks with appearances from West\u2019s \u201cWatch the Throne\u201d collaborator and frenemy Jay-Z, as well as The Weeknd, Travis Scott, Kid Cudi, Lil Yachty, Young Thug and many more, \u201cDonda\u201d arrives two years after the polarizing hip-hop star pivoted to gospel music with his profanity-free record \u201cJesus Is King.\u201dOn \u201cDonda,\u201d however, West is back to his old tricks: primarily stirring up plenty of controversy by featuring collaborators DaBaby, who\u2019s recently faced major backlash over his homophobic comments, and Marilyn Manson, who\u2019s been accused of sexual abuse by multiple women.Both men appeared at West\u2019s most recent listening party at Chicago\u2019s Soldier Field on Thursday, where they stood alongside the rapper in coordinating looks, presumably as some sort of commentary about cancel culture. While Manson is credited as a co-writer on \u201cJail,\u201d as well as the additional track, \u201cJail pt 2,\u201d under his legal name Brian Warner, according to Spotify, DaBaby\u2019s verse on the latter song wasn\u2019t initially cleared.A post shared by ye (@kanyewest)According to texts posted to West\u2019s Instagram on Saturday night, DaBaby\u2019s manager had yet to give the song a green light.The 22-time Grammy winner, however, came to the rapper\u2019s defense, writing in the texts that he\u2019s \u201cnot taking my brother off\u201d because he \u201cwas the only person who said he would vote for me in public,\u201d presumably referring to West\u2019s failed and very embarrassing presidential campaign. West apparently got the go-ahead later in the day, as \u201cJail pt 2\u201d with DaBaby\u2019s verse is now available to stream on all platforms.The album arrives in the middle of West\u2019s divorce proceedings from Kim Kardashian West, who appeared at his latest listening party to seemingly recreate their nuptials, and the reality TV star gets plenty of shoutouts on the record. \u201cYou made a choice that\u2019s yo\u2019 bad, single life ain\u2019t so bad,\u201d West says on the track \u201cJail,\u201d while he name-drops another celebrity marriage in peril on \u201cBelieve What I Say.\u201d\u201cI be going through things that I had to wrote/ Celebrity drama that only Brad\u2019d know,\u201d he raps on a separate verse, presumably giving a shoutout to Brad Pitt who\u2019s currently in the midst of a years-long divorce battle with Angelina Jolie. \u201cToo many family secrets, somebody pass the notes.\u201dDespite the confusion surrounding Kardashian\u2019s bridal moment at the listening event, the pair are reportedly still planning to go through with their divorce.\u201cThey have come a long way since Kim filed for divorce,\u201d an unnamed source told People, noting the display of support was a sign of the bond they share as co-parents to their four children. \u201cIt\u2019s taken them months to get to this point.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostAt this point, if Sarah Paulson isn\u2019t wearing some sort of prosthetic and iconic hairstyle (reminder: she wore four separate wigs to play Marcia Clark in \u201cAmerican Crime Story\u201d), is it really a Sarah Paulson performance? For her role in the next installment of Ryan Murphy\u2019s anthology series \u201cImpeachment: American Crime Story,\u201d the Emmy-winning star has transformed once again to play Linda Tripp, the whistleblower who exposed former President Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky. But this time around, Paulson went to extra lengths to portray Tripp, gaining 30 pounds and wearing nearly 5 pounds of padding to accentuate the character\u2019s shape along with a prosthetic nose and teeth. While her performance seems guaranteed for Emmys attention, early photos of Paulson on set wearing what she later described as \u201cbody transformational accoutrements\u201d sparked some backlash online. Critics saw Paulson\u2019s latest transformation as yet another example of Hollywood\u2019s unfortunate history with fat phobia and sidelining plus-sized actors from getting parts. Speaking with the Los Angeles Times in an interview published this past week, Paulson thoughtfully addressed the dialogue surrounding her casting, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of controversy around actors and fat suits, and I think that controversy is a legitimate one.\u201d\u201cI think fat phobia is real. I think to pretend otherwise causes further harm. And it is a very important conversation to be had,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut that entire responsibility I don\u2019t think falls on the actor for choosing to do something that is arguably \u2014 and I\u2019m talking about from the inside out \u2014 the challenge of a lifetime.\u201dShe went on to add that casting another actor to play Tripp solely because of a physical resemblance to the real-life figure would be a \u201creal reduction of the offering the actor has to make.\u201d\u201cI would like to believe that there is something in my being that makes me right to play this part,\u201d Paulson continued. \u201cAnd that the magic of hair and makeup departments and costumers and cinematographers that has been part of moviemaking, and suspension of belief, since the invention of cinema.\u201d\u201cWas I supposed to say no [to the part]? This is the question,\u201d she added.While Paulson addressed the varied nuances of the issue, one outstanding \u201cregret\u201d that has persisted is \u201cnot thinking about it more fully\u201d given the entertainment industry\u2019s track record for celebrating certain bodies over others. \u201cThat is an important thing for me to think about and reflect on,\u201d she said. \u201cI also know it\u2019s a privileged place to be sitting and thinking about it and reflecting on it, having already gotten to do it, and having had an opportunity that someone else didn\u2019t have.\u201dShe continued, \u201cYou can only learn what you learn when you learn it. Should I have known? Abso-f\u2013king-lutely. But I do now. And I wouldn\u2019t make the same choice going forward.\u201dBack in 2019, Paulson suggested she wouldn\u2019t be wearing a fat suit for the role, as the series, which was produced by the real-life Monica Lewinsky, attempts to rewrite long-held narratives about women in the public eye. \u201cI\u2019m going to take about three months off to eat some food, because I\u2019m going to gain some weight to play her,\u201d Paulson said at the New Yorker Festival. \u201cI don\u2019t want to wear a suit because I think it will feel very strange.\u201dBut apparently things changed over the project\u2019s extended production process, which was heavily delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cImpeachment: American Crime Story\u201d is set to premiere on FX on Sept. 7.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Reporter, HuffPostA judge increased Canadian rapper Tory Lanez\u2019s bail by $60,000 after he violated a protective order requiring him to keep a distance of at least 100 yards from Megan Thee Stallion.Lanez, who faces charges related to the July 2020 shooting of Megan, appeared in court in Los Angeles on Monday, just weeks after he made a surprise appearance at the Rolling Loud Miami festival in July. During his appearance, Lanez performed onstage with rapper DaBaby just after Megan Thee Stallion performed her own set on the same stage.In October, the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office charged Lanez with one felony count each of assault with a semiautomatic firearm and carrying a loaded unregistered firearm in a vehicle. Prosecutors say the shooting happened after Lanez got into an argument with a 24-year-old victim while riding in an SUV in the Hollywood Hills.While Megan Thee Stallion wasn\u2019t mentioned by name as the victim, the \u201cWAP\u201d rapper has publicly alleged he was the shooter. The New York Daily News reported at the time that the female victim had exited the vehicle and then Lanez shot at her feet several times.Lanez, whose real name is Daystar Peterson, has pleaded not guilty.In court on Monday, Lanez apologized to Judge Keith H. Borjon for popping up at Rolling Loud. Borjon at one point threatened to issue Lanez a court-ordered tracking device, Billboard reported.But the rapper\u2019s attorney, Shawn Holley, convinced the judge not to do so by arguing that \u201cit was a unique circumstance, errors in judgment were made, but this can easily be prevented from happening again.\u201d\u201cIf [Tory\u2019s] intention was to harass or intimidate [Megan Thee Stallion], she would have known he was there at the time. He would have seen her and she would have seen him. ... He went there for a legitimate purpose as far as his artistry is concerned ... to perform a song, a part of a song,\u201d she said.Prosecutor Kathy Ta countered that Lanez\u2019s appearance after Megan\u2019s performance was \u201cnot a situational circumstance,\u201d Billboard reported.\u201cThe [sheer] amount of effort it required [for Tory] to get to this venue and do everything that he did, I think that speaks volumes about his conduct. It wasn\u2019t by chance and it wasn\u2019t a situational situation, it was by design,\u201d she said.Borjon warned that Lanez is \u201cfacing years in prison, over 22 years in prison,\u201d and that the rapper does not \u201cwant to be doing things like this.\u201d\u201cYou have the means and the wherewithal and a lot of smart people around you to advise you as to how you should be conducting your life, so we don\u2019t have to have hearings like this,\u201d the judge said.Lanez\u2019s bail was then upped from $190,000 to $250,000. He\u2019s due back in court on Sept. 2.In August 2020, Megan Thee Stallion spoke out about the incident in an Instagram Live, telling fans: \u201cYes ... Tory shot me. You shot me and you got your publicist and your people going to these blogs lying. Stop lying. Why lie? I don\u2019t understand.\u201dShe also said she didn\u2019t tell Los Angeles police about the shooting because she feared for her safety and the legal repercussions.\u201cI didn\u2019t tell the police nothing because I didn\u2019t want us to get in no more trouble,\u201d she said in the video.Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The allegations were detailed in the affidavit that released along with the criminal complaint in the case.Manson is charged with two misdemeanor counts of simple assault stemming from an alleged incident on Aug. 19, 2019, at the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion in Gilford. The misdemeanor charges can each result in a jail sentence of less than a year and a $2,000 fine if convicted.An arraignment hearing on the charges will be scheduled for Sept. 2 at Laconia District Court in New Hampshire.Manson\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday.Susan Fountain, a videographer, was in the venue\u2019s stage pit area at the time of the alleged assault. Her company, Metronome Media, was contracted by the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion for the concert season.According to the affidavit, Manson approached Fountain the first time, put his face close to the camera and spit a \u201cbig lougee\u201d at her. She was struck on both hands with saliva.Manson allegedly returned a second time, covering one side of his nostril and blowing in Fountain\u2019s direction. Fountain put down her camera and went to the restroom to wash her hands and arms that had Manson\u2019s bodily fluids on them.Manson also has faced abuse accusations \u2014 unrelated to the New Hampshire incident \u2014 in recent years. He has denied wrongdoing.In February, actor Evan Rachel Wood publicly accused Manson, her ex-fiance, of sexual and other physical abuse, alleging she was \u201cmanipulated into submission\u201d during their relationship. Months later, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Esm\u00e9 Bianco sued Manson in federal court in Los Angeles, alleging sexual, physical and emotional abuse.The AP generally does not identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Bianco and Wood have spoken publicly.In 2018, Los Angeles County prosecutors declined to file charges against Manson over allegations of assault, battery and sexual assault dating to 2011, saying they were limited by statutes of limitations and a lack of corroboration. The accuser in that case was identified only as a social acquaintance of Manson.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

At the time, the singer described the current arrangement as \u201cabusive,\u201d adding, \u201cI haven\u2019t done anything in the world to deserve this treatment.\u201dShe has since hired her own attorney in the case for the first time in 13 years, as her legal team petitions to remove her father, who said last week that he ultimately \u201cintends\u201d to transition away from his role as her conservator without giving a specific time frame. A post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears)In her Monday post, Spears said that she\u2019s done being constrained by \u201cpain \u2026 hurt \u2026 tears \u2026 and heavy burdens\u201d and that she\u2019s embracing a new attitude. \u201cI am a woman \u2026. a beautiful \u2026 sensitive woman who needs to look at myself in my purest form,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do topless pics for the rest of my life cause that would get boring but it sure as hell helps when you need to be enlightened.\u201dSpears concluded her caption by connecting her self-expression to the #FreeBritney movement, writing, \u201cThere\u2019s a way deeper meaning to the movement than you can ever imagine.\u201dThe next court hearing in Spears\u2019 case is set for Sept. 29, as she presses forward with increasingly assertive steps to break away from her father and dissolve the conservatorship.Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPostNick Pugliese believes Americans on both sides of the political aisle can learn a few things from the film \u201cDramarama.\u201d\u201cDramarama,\u201d which opened in theaters last week and is also available for virtual viewing, stars Pugliese as Gene, a high school drama geek and an alter ego of sorts for the film\u2019s writer-director, Jonathan Wysocki. The dramedy takes place in Escondido, California, a conservative-leaning town located about 31 miles north of San Diego, circa 1994.\u201cIt\u2019s about a group of friends who are all across the board politically, religiously, spiritually \u2015 and they talk about it,\u201d the actor, who is making his film acting debut, told HuffPost. \u201cThey argue about sex, AIDS, pregnancy, gay people ... and they\u2019re still as close as ever. They have conversations where they know they\u2019re going to disagree, and they\u2019re fine. Their bond is made stronger. That\u2019s something I feel like we, as a country, have forgotten how to do.\u201d Catch the \u201cDramarama\u201d trailer above. The coming-of-age film begins with Gene trying to calm his nerves before he comes out as gay to his friends at a murder mystery-themed sleepover party shortly before graduation. Things, however, don\u2019t go exactly as planned. Unbeknownst to Gene, each of his pals is also grappling with an adolescent crisis of their own. Rose (Anna Grace Barlow) is exhibiting over-the-top theatrical antics that mask her self-doubt, while Claire (Megan Suri) seems to be harboring a secret. The handsome Oscar (Nico Greetham) professes to be straight \u2015 so why does his gaze seem to linger on Gene in their one-on-one moments?In his interview with HuffPost, Pugliese said his teen years were vastly different from those of his \u201cDramarama\u201d character. The 25-year-old actor grew up in California\u2019s Bay Area, where he was drawn to the performing arts from the get-go. His family and friends also embraced him when he came out as gay. Still, he instantly related to Gene and sees his character arc in \u201cDramarama\u201d as universal.\u201cI honestly just felt like I understood him,\u201d Pugliese said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like, \u2018Oh, that was the 1990s, everybody hated gay people then and now everyone loves them.\u2019 There are still places in the U.S., even in California, that still think that way.\u201d\u201cMost people, when they\u2019re learning about themselves and coming to terms with their own sense of self ... there\u2019s some part of them that still wants to hide,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was just this gut feeling of \u2018I can play this, I can do this, I know this,\u2019 which doesn\u2019t happen very often.\u201dNow that \u201cDramarama\u201d is out in the world, Pugliese is eager to continue acting, but he\u2019s also turned to writing as COVID-19 continues to affect the film industry. During the pandemic, he and his \u201cDramarama\u201d co-star Danielle Kay wrote and starred in the short film \u201cThank You for Being Here,\u201d which premiered at Los Angeles\u2019 Outfest last month and will continue to make the film festival rounds. Pugliese has long admired the likes of Michaela Coel and Christoph Waltz, whose behind-the-scenes talents are just as impressive as those seen in front of the camera. And if Pugliese has his way, \u201cDramarama\u201d will pave the way for more LGBTQ-inclusive stories in film that don\u2019t feel specifically issue-driven. \u201cI want queer characters at the center of every genre,\u201d the actor said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had a heist movie where the robber is a queer character. We haven\u2019t had a psychological thriller with a queer character, nor a crime drama.\u201d \u201cI want queer lenses on everything,\u201d he added. \u201cNot just a particular queer experience.\u201d Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cFree Guy,\u201d an action-comedy starring Ryan Reynolds as a background character in a videogame, opened better than expected over the weekend, collecting an estimated $28.4 million in ticket sales despite a marketplace challenged by COVID-19.After a few weeks of declining audiences and underwhelming debuts amid the delta variant surge, \u201cFree Guy\u201d succeeded with an old-school formula: an original, star-fronted movie with good word-of-mouth playing only in theaters. The movie directed by Shawn Levy was made by the Walt Disney Co.-owned 20th Century Fox, with a theatrical release contractually stipulated for the roughly $100 million production.Playing in 4,165 North American theaters, \u201cFree Guy\u201d was expected to debut around $20 million. Its surprisingly strong opening gave further proof to what some analysts have been saying throughout the year \u2014 hybrid releases that send new movies immediately onto streaming platforms can significantly sacrifice ticket sales. The last two No. 1 movies \u2014 Warner Bros.\u2032 \u201cThe Suicide Squad\u201d and Disney\u2019s \u201cJungle Cruise\u201d \u2014 were debuted simultaneously in theaters and homes.But however movies are being released right now, box office conditions are far from ideal. The rise in U.S. coronavirus cases over the last month has corresponded with diminished ticket sales at theaters. Some cities, including New York and San Francisco, are preparing to make vaccine passports required for entering movie theaters.David A. Gross, who runs the movie consultancy FranchiseRe, estimates that new releases are selling about half the tickets they normally would.\u201cSince Memorial Day weekend, the domestic box office has been running at approx. 50% of 2019 levels, with several spikes from strong titles, but then returning to 50% of 2019,\u201d Gross said in an email. \u201cUnder normal conditions, \u2018Free Guy\u2019 would be opening 50% higher than this weekend\u2019s number \u2014 comfortably.\u201dBut the enthusiasm for \u201cFree Guy\u201d was enough to lead Reynolds to announce Saturday that Disney wants a sequel. In the film, Reynolds\u2019 character, Guy, realizes he\u2019s a \u201cnon-playable character\u201d in a \u201cGrand Theft Auto\u201d-like game. It features co-stars Jodie Comer, Lil Rel Howery and Taika Waititi.Reviews were good (82% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), and a male-heavy audience gave \u201cFree Guy\u201d an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore. (About 60% of moviegoers were male, Disney said.) \u201cFree Guy\u201d also added $22.5 million internationally.\u201cFree Guy\u201d is also the latest in a comeback for gaming-based movies. After decades of futility, Hollywood is increasingly finding success by mining video games for intellectual property. Reynolds starred in one of the best-performing videogame adaptations \u2014 2019\u2032s \u201cPok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu,\u201d which grossed $432 million worldwide.\u201cFree Guy\u201d will play exclusively in theaters for at least 45 days \u2014 and its strong performance through the weekend suggests it could buck the summer\u2019s typical trend of fast drop-offs.Last week\u2019s top film, \u201cThe Suicide Squad,\u201d slid steeply, dropping 70% in its second weekend. After its $26.2 million debut, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d redo pulled in just $7.8 million for Warner Bros., bringing its two-week total to $42.9 million. It\u2019s concurrently playing on HBO Max.That film\u2019s tumble gave a few other releases more room at multiplexes. Sony Pictures\u2019 horror sequel \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe 2\u201d opened with $10.6 million, in line with studio projections. While \u201cDon\u2019t Breathe 2\u201d debuted with less than half the opening of the 2016 original, the sequel was made with a modest budget of $15 million.MGM and United Artists\u2019 Aretha Franklin biopic \u201cRespect,\u201d starring Jennifer Hudson, debuted with $8.8 million. \u201cRespect,\u201d which has drawn praise for Hudson\u2019s leading performance, also landed an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore. Its audience was 66% female.Apple didn\u2019t report grosses for \u201cCODA,\u201d one of the company\u2019s major movie acquisitions and one seen as a crowd-pleasing milestone in deaf representation on screen. The film, starring deaf actors Marlee Matlin, Troy Kotsur and Daniel Durant, was a prize-winning sensation at the Sundance Film Festival in January, where Apple plunked down a festival-record $25 for the film. \u201cCODA,\u201d which stands for a child of a deaf adult, debuted simultaneously in theaters and on Apple TV+.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Much of the early buzz over \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Double Feature\u201d has focused on the addition of Macaulay Culkin to the franchise. The actor makes a chilling appearance in the trailer that will erase any lingering memories of his days as the young star of \u201cHome Alone\u201d and \u201cMy Girl.\u201d Series veterans like Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters also pop up in the clip.Debuting Aug. 25, \u201cRed Tide\u201d follows author Harry Gardener (played by Wittrock), who relocates to a seaside New England town with his pregnant wife Doris (Lily Rabe) in hopes of bolstering his creativity.In true \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d fashion, however, the couple\u2019s hope for an off-season escape from their urban routine turns out to be a nightmare. Similarities to King\u2019s 1977 horror classic \u201cThe Shining,\u201d which followed a tormented writer who moved his family into a haunted hotel for the winter, are no doubt intentional. Murphy, best known as the creative force behind \u201cGlee\u201d and \u201cNip/Tuck,\u201d is busier than ever these days. In May, he unveiled his latest limited series for Netflix, \u201cHalston,\u201d which nabbed Ewan McGregor an Emmy Award nomination. Last week, the streaming platform also unveiled \u201cPray Away,\u201d a documentary about the \u201cgay conversion\u201d therapy movement that Murphy co-produced.His next project, \u201cImpeachment: American Crime Story\u201d focuses on former President Bill Clinton\u2019s sex scandal involving White House intern Monica Lewinsky and is due out on FX in September.

There\u2019s plenty of evidence to show that vaccination helps.\u201d\u201cOn the whole they\u2019ve been very safe,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be some side effect in any drug you take, but to go around saying vaccines are a plot to kill you, I\u2019m sorry, that goes in the fruitcake jar for me.\u201dElsewhere in the Independent interview, May argued that it \u201cwould have been impossible for anyone to make worse decisions\u201d regarding COVID-19 than British Prime Minister Boris Johnson. \u201cAt every point he did too little, too late,\u201d he said. Clapton has actively railed against vaccines and other COVID-19 safety protocols in recent months. Last year, he appeared on Van Morrison\u2019s anti-lockdown song \u201cStand and Deliver,\u201d which features the lyrics: \u201cDo you wanna be a free man, or do you wanna be a slave?\u201d In May, the 17-time Grammy winner detailed his \u201cdisastrous\u201d health experience after receiving a COVID-19 vaccination, and blamed \u201cthe propaganda\u201d for overstating its safety. And last month, he declared plans to cancel his forthcoming performances at venues that require attendees to provide proof of vaccination for entry. \u201cI wish to say that I will not perform on any stage where there is a discriminated audience present,\u201d he wrote on the Telegram messaging app. \u201cUnless there is provision made for all people to attend, I reserve the right to cancel the show.\u201dFans blasted the former Cream guitarist\u2019s vaccine stance on social media, with many reminding him of racist and xenophobic comments he\u2019s made in the past. Clapton is slated to embark on a U.S. tour next month, with concerts scheduled in Texas, Louisiana and Florida.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Markie Post, who played the public defender in the 1980s sitcom \u201cNight Court\u201d and was a regular presence on television for four decades, has died. She was 70.Post\u2019s manager, Ellen Lubin Sanitsky, said Post died Saturday in Los Angeles after a years-long battle with cancer.Post was a longtime television regular who appeared in shows from \u201cCheers\u201d to \u201cScrubs.\u201d But she was best known for her seven-season run on NBC\u2019s \u201cNight Court,\u201d the Manhattan municipal court sitcom that ran from 1984 to 1992 and starred Harry Anderson as Judge Harry T. Stone.Post became a full-time cast member of \u201cNight Court\u201d in season three as Christine Sullivan, a sincere and strong-willed woman who served as a constant foil to Dan Fielding, John Larroquette\u2019s womanizing, narcissistic prosecutor. With comic rebuttal, Post\u2019s Christine deflected Fielding\u2019s lechery throughout the series\u2019 run. Though an unrealized romance between Christine and Harry was often teased, \u201cNight Court\u201d ended with Fielding realizing the public defender was the love of his life.Several of Post\u2019s \u201cNight Court\u201d co-stars have died in recent years. Harry Anderson died at age 65 in 2018. In July, Charles Robinson, who played the clerk Mac died at 75. NBC is currently developing a sequel to the series.Post had two daughters with her second husband, TV producer and writer Michael A. Ross. In a statement, the family said \u201cour pride is in who she was in addition to acting; a person who made elaborate cakes for friends, sewed curtains for first apartments and showed us how to be kind, loving and forgiving in an often harsh world.\u201dPost started in television behind the camera, working on the production crew of the game shows \u201cDouble Dare\u201d and \u201cCard Sharks.\u201d Her first series regular role was in the Lee Majors action-adventure series \u201cThe Fall Guy,\u201d in which she played Terri Michaels from 1982 to 1985.Post\u2019s other credits include playing Cameron Diaz\u2019s mother in \u201cThere\u2019s Something About Mary\u201d; Elliot Reid\u2019s mother on \u201cScrubs\u201d; and appearances in the shows \u201cThe Love Boat,\u201d \u201cThe A-Team\u201d and \u201cFantasy Island.\u201d While receiving chemotherapy treatments, Post acted in the Lifetime movie \u201cChristmas Reservations\u201d and guest-starred on the ABC series \u201cThe Kids Are Alright.\u201dBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Moviegoing, once expected to be closer to semi-normal levels by now, continues to be battered by the pandemic, the delta variant of the coronavirus and in-home streaming. The latest casualty: James Gunn\u2019s \u201cThe Suicide Squad,\u201d a critically acclaimed, carnage-ridden would-be smash that disappointed with $26.5 million in estimated ticket sales.The Warner Bros. film, which was released simultaneously on HBO Max, could claim one pandemic record: the top R-rated opening. But \u201cThe Suicide Squad,\u201d featuring the \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d director\u2019s first DC Comics film, had seemed poised to be a bigger hit \u2014 and may have been if the delta variant wasn\u2019t keeping a lot of moviegoers home.Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief for Warner Bros., acknowledged the recovery is taking longer than anyone hoped.\u201cWe always knew the ramp-up would be two steps forward and one step back,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cBut when we\u2019re living it, it\u2019s not great.\u201dAs recently as a month ago, the outlook for movie theaters was brightening. Marvel\u2019s \u201cBlack Widow\u201d set a pandemic-best mark with a $80 million domestic debut. Now, that movie\u2019s hybrid release is the focus of a bitter legal battle between star Scarlett Johansson and the Walt Disney Co. that has larger ramifications for the economics of big-budget movies in the streaming era.More importantly, COVID cases in the United States have since rocketed \u2014 from a few thousand daily infections to more than 100,000. That has led some to curtail indoor activities and some states to consider changing regulations. New York is planning to make vaccination a requirement for indoor dining and other venues, including movie theaters.\u201cI think avid moviegoers have returned to theaters, and they show up first night and through the weekend,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cBut what we\u2019re not seeing is the casual moviegoers \u2014 those who were interested and would have gone in a pre-pandemic context. Right now, they\u2019re not quite there.\u201dThe result for \u201cThe Suicide Squad\u201d \u2014 strong reviews, underwhelming opening \u2014 is a kind of inverse to 2016\u2032s \u201cSuicide Squad,\u201d which was lambasted by critics but also made a lot of money. The film, directed by David Ayer (who has since called the film \u201cnot my cut\u201d), opened with $133.7 million in the U.S. and Canada, eventually grossing $745 million worldwide.) In part because of fan backlash to DC titles like \u201cThe Suicide Squad,\u201d Gunn was brought in to set a more irreverent tone.Gunn\u2019s movie, a sequel-reboot that returns some cast members but not others, drew good reviews (92% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), already has a series spinoff starring John Cena upcoming and was largely endorsed by moviegoers with a B+ CinemaScore. The film stars Idris Elba, Margot Robbie, Viola Davis and Joel Kinnaman. Not back: Will Smith or Jared Leto.\u201cThe Suicide Squad\u201d cost about $185 million to make, but the current state of the box office doesn\u2019t offer much of a chance for profitability for movies at that scale. Warner didn\u2019t release any streaming or subscription data related to the \u201cThe Suicide Squad,\u201d but Goldstein said that every release has seen \u201ca proportional response\u201d on HBO Max that correlates to its popularity in theaters. If it\u2019s a hit in theaters, it\u2019s a hit on streaming.Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for data firm Comscore, said that while he believes day-and-date releases can hurt a movie\u2019s box office, the dominant variable is still the pandemic.\u201cToday is a very different marketplace than it was even just a few weeks ago, which makes any kind of long-term proclamations as to what\u2019s going on with the movie industry or movie theaters very challenging,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cThe desire for going to the movies is there, but the marketplace is in flux.\u201dLast week\u2019s top film, Disney\u2019s even pricier \u201cJungle Cruise,\u201d also opened softer than expected, collecting $34 million in the U.S. and Canada against a reported budget of $200 million. While most titles this year have fallen fast after release, \u201cJungle Cruise\u201d held reasonably well, dropping 55% in its second week with $15.7 million. Globally, it has totaled $122 million. That doesn\u2019t include the $30 million Disney said \u201cJungle Cruise\u201d made in its first weekend in \u201cearly access\u201d purchases on Disney+. (Disney didn\u2019t share updated streaming revenue in the movie\u2019s second week.)If COVID-19 cases don\u2019t drop soon, studios will be faced with the difficult question of what to do with upcoming tentpole releases \u2014 especially distributors that aren\u2019t as tethered to streaming platforms. Eyes will be on how MGM handles the James Bond film \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d (Oct. 8) and whether Sony holds with \u201cVenom: Let There Be Carnage\u201d (Sept. 24). Paramount recently postponed the release of \u201cClifford the Big Red Dog\u201d citing the rise of the delta variant.\u201cCurrently, this is an unforgiving market,\u201d said David A. Gross, who runs the movie consultancy firm Franchise Entertainment Research. \u201cThe last couple of big movies have been flawed. Under normal conditions, a strong marketing campaign can overcome a few drawbacks and generate a good weekend. Under current conditions, that isn\u2019t happening.\u201dGoldstein said that if not for the streaming half of its releases, Warner Bros. wouldn\u2019t likely be opening films like \u201cThe Suicide Squad.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve definitely declared that a day-and-date strategy with HBO Max is not our plan and it\u2019s not what we\u2019re going to do in 2022. But if we didn\u2019t do this in 2021, we couldn\u2019t afford the marketing, let alone it would have been ridiculous to put the movies out,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a complicated time.\u201dSome independent films have still found relative success. Tom McCarthy\u2019s \u201cStillwater,\u201d starring Matt Damon, added $2.9 million to bring its two-week total past $10 million for Focus Features. David Lowery\u2019s \u201cThe Green Knight\u201d grossed $2.6 million to bring its two-week gross to $12.2 million.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The reality TV star went above and beyond to show that family and fashion come first even in a post-Kimye world. On Thursday, Kardashian attended the second listening event for the rapper\u2019s forthcoming and much-delayed new album, \u201cDonda,\u201d at Atlanta\u2019s Mercedes-Benz Stadium, where he is reportedly living until his new project is completed. Despite their split, Kardashian and West assumed a united front, dressing in coordinated outfits. Hers was a black skin-tight Balenciaga body suit with a full-face mask featuring zipper holes for her eyes and mouth, and a long braided ponytail.West wore a similar, mask-forward ensemble from the same brand, and added a vest with the album\u2019s name \u2015 a tribute to his late mother, Donda West \u2015 emblazoned on the back. A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian)The event was a full-fledged family affair: Kardashian and West\u2019s kids \u2015 daughters North, 8, and Chicago, 3, and sons Saint, 5, and Psalm, 2 \u2015 also supported their dad in monochromatic black looks. Kardashian posted some behind-the-scenes photos from the listening party, which reportedly drew 40,000 guests, including a full look at her daring outfit and snaps of the family gathering backstage. In a video in her post, West, affixed to some sort of harness, rose above the stadium, bathed in an epic beam of light, which represented the \u201cprotection he feels from his mother,\u201d according to The New York Times. At the rapper\u2019s first \u201cDonda\u201d listening event in July, Kardashian and West also wore matching outfits.The new album, which is now expected to be released on Aug. 15, reportedly includes numerous mentions of the former couple\u2019s split.On one emotional track, West raps about \u201closing my family;\u201d on another, he discusses purchasing a \u201csixty million dollar home\u201d that he \u201cnever went home to\u201d \u2014 presumably referencing the couple\u2019s massive Hidden Hills house, where Kardashian currently resides. The SKIMS founder filed for divorce from West in February after six years of marriage.The two have seemingly remained on good terms in the months since, expressing support for each other in social media posts and agreeing to joint custody of their children. \u201cWe have an amazing co-parenting relationship. And I respect him so much,\u201d Kardashian said about West during the \u201cKeeping Up With The Kardashians\u201d reunion in June. \u201cYou know that was my friend first, first and foremost, for a long time. So I can\u2019t see that going away. I will forever be Kanye\u2019s biggest fan. He\u2019s the father of my kids. He will always be family.\u201d Her camp has continued to promote a similar idea, with an unnamed People source claiming that it\u2019s \u201cvery important to her that the kids spend as much time as possible with Kanye.\u201d\u201cKim is trying to be supportive.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPostAfter a few unexpected pivots, Nina West is set to follow in the nimble footsteps of drag icons by taking on her dream role this fall. The \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d veteran will star as Edna Turnblad in the national tour of the musical \u201cHairspray,\u201d which opens Nov. 17 in San Diego, California, and will visit more than 60 U.S. cities. West will be joined by Niki Metcalf and Toneisha Harris as Tracy Turnblad and Motormouth Maybelle, respectively, with additional casting to be announced later. \u201cThis is the role I\u2019ve always wanted,\u201d said West, whose real name is Andrew Levitt. \u201cEdna\u2019s journey as a character is a journey I\u2019ve been on \u2015 not seeing how beautiful we are on the outside, not trusting we are worthy, being ashamed of ourselves. It\u2019s a journey many of us go on, right?\u201dBased on John Waters\u2019 1988 film of the same name, \u201cHairspray\u201d follows Tracy Turnblad, an energetic, fun-loving teen in 1960s Baltimore whose dream is to dance on the most popular variety show on TV. After landing a role, Tracy begins to campaign for the show to be desegregated so that she can share the spotlight with performers of color.Edna Turnblad, the protagonist\u2019s mother, was played in the 1988 movie by drag icon Divine and in the original 2003 Broadway production of the musical by Harvey Fierstein. (The less said about John Travolta\u2019s portrayal in the 2007 movie adaptation of the musical, the better.) West\u2019s \u201cHairspray\u201d journey dates back to 2019, when she received a phone call from Jerry Mitchell, who choreographed the original Broadway staging, to audition for the new production. She formally landed the role of Edna in March of last year, just one week before theaters across the U.S. closed to curb the spread of COVID-19. The experience of being cast in a dream role, only to have it ripped away indefinitely before rehearsals commenced, was \u201chumbling,\u201d West said. \u201cAs an artist, you\u2019re like, \u2018God, how do I prepare for this? What am I going to do next?\u2019 Everyone was saying, \u2018Pivot, pivot, pivot!\u2019 So the pandemic, for me, has been a quick learning tool on how to regroup and how to constantly stay aware, awake and energized.\u201d And to her credit, West has spent most of the past 16 months boosting her profile in major ways. Last year, she partnered with Dolly Parton for a clothing line called \u201cKindness is Queen\u201d and, later, with actor Patricia Clarkson on a musical tribute to Kamala Harris, then the Democratic vice presidential nominee, before election night. In June, she hosted the livestreamed Disney+ concert \u201cThis Is Me: Pride Celebration Spectacular,\u201d where she duetted with Kermit the Frog. Collectively, West views those experiences her on-the-ground training for \u201cHairspray,\u201d which she considers one of the best musicals ever written. \u201cWe are at an impasse in our country,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople in our country are scared and unsure if it\u2019s even safe to leave our homes. We\u2019ve politicized getting a shot that will take care of people and allow them to be healthy. ... I think a show like \u2018Hairspray\u2019 is going to allow us to celebrate, reconnect and refocus.\u201d \u201cThe role allows me to bring Nina, a drag character I\u2019ve been cultivating for 20 years,\u201d she added. \u201cIt also allows me to be Andrew and celebrate that part of myself as an actor doing the work. I\u2019ve really leaned into being very vulnerable with people and allowing myself to be pretty honest.\u201d Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Senior Reporter, HuffPostHours before rapper DaBaby was set to headline the Lollapalooza Music Festival on Sunday night, organizers pulled him from the event\u2019s line-up over his recent homophobic statements. The Grammy-nominated rapper, known for hits like \u201cRockstar\u201d and a remix of Dua Lipa\u2019s \u201cLevitating,\u201d has faced major backlash since making homophobic and misogynistic remarks \u2014 specifically harmful and inaccurate comments about people living with HIV/AIDS \u2014 at the Rolling Loud festival in Miami last weekend.In the days since, his onstage rant has been widely condemned by music industry titans, including Elton John, Madonna and Questlove, while the fashion company BoohooMAN announced it would be cutting ties with the rapper.

DaBaby did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.During his set at Rolling Loud last week, the rapper told the crowd, \u201cIf you didn\u2019t show up today with HIV/AIDS, or any of them deadly sexually transmitted diseases, that\u2019ll make you die in two to three weeks, then put your cellphone lighter up! Ladies, if your pussy smell like water, put your cellphone lighter up! Fellas, if you ain\u2019t sucking dick in the parking lot, put your cellphone lighter up!\u201dAfter initially doubling down on his comments, he later issued a formal (albeit half-hearted) apology on social media.\u201cAnybody who done ever been effected by AIDS/HIV y\u2019all got the right to be upset, what I said was insensitive even though I have no intentions on offending anybody. So my apologies,\u201d he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. \u201cBut the LGBT community... I ain\u2019t trippin on y\u2019all, do you. y\u2019all business is y\u2019all business.\u201dThe statement did little to absolve DaBaby, with GLAAD blasting his rhetoric as \u201cinaccurate, hurtful, and harmful to the LGBTQ community.\u201dElton John, who is openly gay and a longtime advocate for those living with HIV, issued a statement in response to the rapper\u2019s comments, writing that he was \u201cshocked\u201d to read about the controversy, as it \u201cfuels stigma and discrimination and is the opposite of what our world needs to fight the AIDS epidemic.\u201dMadonna described DaBaby\u2019s views as \u201chateful\u201d and encouraged him to \u201cknow your facts,\u201d before spreading misinformation. \u201cAIDs is not transmitted by standing next to someone in a crowd,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cI want to put my cellphone lighter up and pray for your ignorance, No one dies of AIDS in 2 or 3 weeks anymore.

Prince Harry will donate proceeds to charity, according to Random House.\u201cPrince Harry will share, for the very first time, the definitive account of the experiences, adventures, losses, and life lessons that have helped shape him,\u201d Random House announced.\u201cCovering his lifetime in the public eye from childhood to the present day, including his dedication to service, the military duty that twice took him to the frontlines of Afghanistan, and the joy he has found in being a husband and father, Prince Harry will offer an honest and captivating personal portrait, one that shows readers that behind everything they think they know lies an inspiring, courageous, and uplifting human story.\u201dMonday\u2019s announcement comes four months after Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, made worldwide news during their interview with Oprah Winfrey near the couple\u2019s home in Montecito, California.Meghan spoke of feeling lonely and nearly suicidal before they left England last year and Harry acknowledged tension with his father, Prince Charles, over his decision to step back from his royal duties and his marriage to the biracial American actor.\u201cThere is a lot to work through there,\u201d Harry said about his relationship with his father, who was divorced from Diana, Princess of Wales, at the time of her fatal car accident in 1997. \u201cI feel really let down. He\u2019s been through something similar. He knows what pain feels like. And Archie (Harry and Meghan\u2019s son) is his grandson. I will always love him, but there is a lot of hurt that has happened.\u201dHarry told Winfrey that he felt trapped by royal life and that his family cut off him financially and took away his security. He also acknowledged his relations were strained with his brother, Prince William.\u201cI was trapped, but I didn\u2019t know I was trapped,\u201d Harry said, before adding, \u201cMy father and my brother, they are trapped.\u201dLast month, Meghan published the picture book \u201cThe Bench\u201d through Random House Books for Young Readers.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

After publishing the pants-free post, Jamie Lynn Spears disabled her Instagram comments, presumably due to harassment from Britney Spears\u2019s fans for not showing adequate support for her sibling.A few days after she disabled her comments, Jamie Lynn Spears shared an emotional series of videos on Instagram stories about how proud she was of her sister.\u201cIf any of the conservatorship is flying to Mars or whatever the hell else she wants to do to be happy, I support that 100%, because I support my sister,\u201d Jamie Lynn Spears said in a video. \u201cI love my sister, always have, always will, as long as she\u2019s happy.

In her first public appearance since withdrawing from the French Open and Wimbledon over mental health concerns, the four-time Grand Slam champion attended the show on Saturday night in New York City, where she picked up the award for Best Athlete, Women\u2019s Sports.Arriving on the red carpet in a bold black and white striped top and a green Louis Vuitton skirt, the tennis superstar was accompanied by rapper boyfriend Cordae at the show, which honors the year\u2019s top athletes and sports moments.Osaka, who has been open about her struggles with depression and social anxiety, powered through her nerves to give a short but sweet acceptance speech later in the evening. \u201cI just really want to not say a long speech because I\u2019m a bit nervous \u2026 I know this year has been really, it hasn\u2019t even finished, but it\u2019s been really tough for a lot of us,\u201d she said on stage from The Rooftop at Pier 17. \u201cFor me, I just want to say, I really love you guys and this is my first ESPYS so it\u2019s really cool to be surrounded by all these incredible athletes. I think all of you guys are really cool and I watch some of you on TV so it\u2019s really surreal to be here ... Thank you so much.\u201dOsaka has largely stayed off the court and out of the public eye in recent weeks after revealing she has suffered from \u201clong bouts of depression\u201d since the U.S. Open in 2018 and has had \u201ca really hard time coping with that.\u201dThe 23-year-old pulled out of Wimbledon and withdrew from the French Open after she was fined $15,000 and threatened with suspension over her refusal to participate in press for the event. Her decision drew praise from a series of public figures and fellow athletes who supported Osaka for prioritizing her mental health over trophies and setting a powerful example of self-care.At the start of the ceremony, \u201cFalcon and the Winter Soldier\u201d star Anthony Mackie, who hosted the award show, publicly called out tennis officials for unfairly punishing Osaka. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. I\u2019m no tennis exec, I don\u2019t know, but if my sport had one of the most popular and marketable athletes on the planet, you know what I would do? I would probably make sure she felt comfortable and respected,\u201d he said. \u201cBut hey, what do I know, right? I\u2019m just Captain America.\u201dOsaka\u2019s appearance at the award show arrived on the heels of a powerful essay she wrote for Time magazine, in which she further elaborated on her decision to briefly step away from the game. \u201cPerhaps we should give athletes the right to take a mental break from media scrutiny on a rare occasion without being subject to strict sanctions. In any other line of work, you would be forgiven for taking a personal day here and there, so long as it\u2019s not habitual,\u201d she wrote candidly. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have to divulge your most personal symptoms to your employer; there would likely be HR measures protecting at least some level of privacy.\u201d\u201cIn my case, I felt under a great amount of pressure to disclose my symptoms \u2014 frankly because the press and the tournament did not believe me.\u201dThe tennis champion, however, said she was eager to return to the court for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, writing that she \u201ccould not be more excited to play\u201d in the games after taking the \u201ctime to reflect, but also to look forward.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

On the latest episode released on Wednesday, Pinkett Smith candidly opened up about her past drug and alcohol abuse, saying she\u2019s a \u201cwalking miracle\u201d given her family\u2019s long history with addiction. The \u201cGirls Trip\u201d star described herself as a \u201chard liquor drinker\u201d in the past \u2015 as opposed to her \u201clightweight\u201d husband Will Smith \u2015 before she moved on to red wine, which she believed at the time wasn\u2019t as dangerous. \u201cDrinking red wine for me was like drinking glasses of water,\u201d she shared on the Facebook Watch series. \u201cBecause I\u2019m used to that hard hit. I was drinking hard in high school, too, and when I got out here I was doing cocktails. So, ecstasy, alcohol, weed. Let me tell you, I was having me a little ball.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t doing things that I thought were addictive,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut I would do those three together. That was my cocktail. Your threshold becomes so high, that what it takes for you to get to the place you need to get to, it\u2019ll take me two bottles to get to ... OK, if I do ecstasy, weed and alcohol at the same time I\u2019m gonna get there faster and I can keep the high going.\u201dPinkett Smith went on to add that she\u2019s a \u201cbinger\u201d who would try to keep her partying contained to the weekends. But there was one instance where her substance abuse affected her work life. Pinkett Smith talked for the first time about an \u201ceye-opening incident\u201d on the set of the 1996 film \u201cThe Nutty Professor.\u201d \u201cI passed out. I went to work high, and it was a bad batch of ecstasy,\u201d she explained. \u201cI told everybody that I must\u2019ve had old medication in a vitamin bottle. That\u2019s what I said. ... But I tell you what I did though. Got my ass together and got on that set. That was the last time.\u201dSince then, Pinkett Smith said, she\u2019s been \u201ccold turkey\u201d besides an occasional glass of red wine, adding, \u201cI cannot touch vodka. I cannot touch rum. Rum\u2019s another one. No dark liquor.\u201dAddiction runs in the family, as her mother, Adrienne Banfield-Norris, has previously shared her 20-year struggle with heroin use.Reflecting on her daughter\u2019s own journey with drugs and alcohol, Banfield-Norris noted the stress she\u2019s experienced as a \u201crecovering addict dealing with my family that is not accepting of the fact that addiction runs deep in our veins.\u201d\u201cI think back on my life, like, I am a walking miracle, no doubt about that,\u201d Pinkett Smith later added. \u201cPeople will not believe.\u201dSenior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Prosecutors had agreed that any prison term should be below the guidelines range because of her cooperation.\u201cThe NXIVM saga and the story of Ms. Mack\u2019s descent have been a tragedy for all involved. But that need not, and should not, be the end of the story for Allison Mack,\u201d her lawyers wrote in court papers.Mack, 38, was once part of the inner circle of Raniere, whose group attracted millionaires and actors among its adherents. Prosecutors said she became a \u201cmaster\u201d for \u201cslaves\u201d she ordered \u201cto perform labor, take nude photographs, and in some cases, to engage in sex acts with Raniere.\u201dAs authorities closed in on Raniere, he fled to Mexico with Mack and others to try to reconstitute the group there. He was arrested and sent to the United States in March 2018; Mack was arrested a few days later.\u201cMs. Mack now understands that this was the best thing that could have happened to her at that time,\u201d the defense papers said.Mack provided information to prosecutors about how Raniere encouraged \u201cthe use of demeaning and derogatory language, including racial slurs, to humiliate \u2018slaves,\u2019\u201d the government papers said. More importantly, she provided a recording of a conversation she had with Raniere about the branding, they added.The branding should involve \u201ca vulnerable position type of a thing\u201d with \u201chands probably above the head being held, almost like being tied down, like sacrificial, whatever,\u201d Raniere told her.

He was 78.\u201cCops\u201d was among the first reality series on the air when it debuted in 1989, and it would become an institution through 32 seasons. Langley and production partner Malcolm Barbour had shopped the idea for years, and found a home for it on the fledgling Fox network.The show was famous for following police, from deputies in the Deep South to officers from big city police departments, on long, boring nights in patrol cars or in fevered foot chases.Its quirks, including its often shirtless suspects and its reggae theme song \u201cBad Boys,\u201d were frequent fodder for standup comics and were often referenced in films, TV shows and songs.It ran on Fox until 2013, when Viacom-owned Spike TV, later re-branded as The Paramount Network, picked it up.It came under criticism for what was considered a slanted, pro-police perspective, and was permanently pulled from the air by Paramount last year during worldwide protests over the killing of George Floyd.Some versions of the show still air internationally in syndication.Langley was born in Oklahoma City and raised in Los Angeles. He graduated from California State University, Dominguez Hills, and served in the U.S. Army in the early 1960s.Langley was also a producer on the 2009 film \u201cBrooklyn\u2019s Finest,\u201d directed by Antoine Fuqua and starring Richard Gere and Don Cheadle, and on the non-fiction series \u201cJail,\u201d \u201cVegas Strip\u201d and \u201cAnatomy of a Crime.\u201dHe was an off-road racing enthusiast and frequently drove in events like the one he took part in Saturday.Langley is survived by his son and producing partner, Morgan, who oversees their company Langley Productions; another son, Zak; two daughters, Sara Langley Dews and Jennifer Blair; his wife, Maggie, and seven grandchildren.By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

The two-time Academy Award nominee announced the release of his new memoir, \u201cWill,\u201d on Instagram Saturday, revealing that his first book is due to hit shelves Nov. 9.\u201cI know this is weird but this is my book,\u201d the actor, using a Pixar-style Instagram filter, shared in a video over the weekend, as he showed off the memoir\u2019s vibrant cover. \u201cIt\u2019s been a labor of love. I\u2019ve been working on it for the past two years and it\u2019s finally ready.\u201dWhile fans are likely already familiar with some of the actor\u2019s backstory, the \u201cbrave and inspiring book\u201d will dive deep into his rise from a Philadelphia teen to global superstar and chronicle the highs and lows of his trailblazing and decades-spanning career. A post shared by Will Smith (@willsmith)Smith first broke onto the scene as part of the hip-hop duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince in the late \u201980s, ultimately picking up a couple of Grammy Awards along the way. After making his mark with the iconic sitcom \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\u201d Smith went on to conquer the big screen and fronted a string of box-office hits, including \u201cBad Boys,\u201d \u201cMen in Black,\u201d \u201cHitch\u201d and \u201cIndependence Day.\u201d\u201cIn \u2018Will,\u2019 one of the most dynamic and globally-recognized entertainment forces of our time opens up fully about his life, tracing his learning curve to a place where outer success, inner happiness, and human connection are aligned. Along the way, \u2018Will\u2019 tells the story in full of one of the most amazing rides through the worlds of music and film that anyone has ever had,\u201d Penguin Press said in a press release. The 352-page memoir, which Smith wrote in collaboration with \u201cThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck\u201d author Mark Manson, was first announced by Penguin Random House back in 2018. The cover was designed by New Orleans-based visual artist Brandan \u201cBMike\u201d Odums.Described as a \u201cproduct of a profound journey of self-knowledge,\u201d the memoir also explores how Smith learned to \u201cmaster his own emotions\u201d and aims to help readers do the same. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to maneuver the material world once you have conquered your own mind. I believe that. Once you\u2019ve learned the terrain of your own mind, every experience, every emotion, every circumstance, whether positive or negative, simply propels you forward, to greater growth and greater experience,\u201d Smith said in a statement. \u201cThat is true will. To move forward in spite of anything. And to move forward in a way that brings others with you, rather than leave them behind.\u201dAs of Sunday, \u201cWill\u201d had already topped Amazon\u2019s list of actor and entertainer biographies, as Smith took to Instagram to thank his fans for supporting his new venture.A post shared by Will Smith (@willsmith)Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

As the rest of her family members are reshuffling their romantic lives, the cosmetics mogul has seemingly gotten back together with Travis Scott, with whom she shares 3-year-old daughter Stormi Webster. Since splitting nearly two years ago, the former couple made their first red carpet appearance together at the 72nd annual Parsons Benefit hosted by The New School in New York City on Tuesday night with their little one in tow.

The second-youngest member of the KarJenner clan had a \u201crule\u201d to decide whether her paramours would be included in the show, Farjam said. \u201cKendall\u2019s always had this rule, which she felt like she had to be with someone for at least a year before she lets them be a part of the show and in the show,\u201d said Farjam. \u201cBecause she doesn\u2019t always know what people\u2019s intentions are.

One of the documents says an officer who was trying to handcuff Bartlett was struck multiple times.The documents say Bartlett was aggressive as he resisted arrest in downtown Miami. One of the officers said he had ordered him and all the passengers in the car he was traveling in to get out of the vehicle to pat them down for firearms, saying he suspected they carried weapons because they heard a passenger claim the vehicle was bulletproof.The police department said it was reviewing the incident that would include examining all camera footage, saying the arrest was captured on several body-worn cameras. Police spokesman Michael Vega said it also was investigating several threats received against personnel and facilities in response to the rapper\u2019s arrest.The Chicago-based artist had just released his newest album \u201cHall of Fame\u201d on Friday. His single \u201cRapstar\u201d debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in April. His mother and manager said on Instagram that Polo G and his younger brother were riding in a car with security after an album release party.The mother, Stacia Mac, posted a message on Facebook saying she had bonded out Polo G and other people who were arrested in the same traffic stop.

With an abundance of groups like \u2019N Sync, Backstreet Boys, O-Town, Boyz II Men, New Kids on the Block and 98 Degrees, it\u2019s hardly surprising there would be some rivalry both on and off the stage.In an interview with Variety published Tuesday, Kirkpatrick opened up about how his friendships with other boy-band singers have evolved over the years \u2015 in particular, his friendship with the Backstreet Boys\u2019 AJ McLean.\u201cThere was a time when I couldn\u2019t be in the same room with this guy,\u201d Kirkpatrick told Variety. \u201cBut there\u2019s always been a mutual respect, and now that we\u2019re all parents, we\u2019ve grown up. Reflecting on things, it\u2019s cool to see what each of the bands did and how it all worked together. It really was this symbiotic relationship with Backstreet, 98 Degrees, us and even O-Town and other bands that came in.\u201dFans of both bands will remember Kirkpatrick and McLean as the notably \u201calt\u201d members of their respective groups. McLean was almost always seen with a goatee and sunglasses and/or a hat, while Kirkpatrick rocked everything from braids to spiky hair alongside earrings and a goatee of his own. Perhaps this prompted their beef?The world may never know. At any rate, their rivalry has since been quashed, and Kirkpatrick says he now counts McLean as one of his closest friends. McLean even referred to himself, Kirkpatrick and 98 Degrees singer Jeff Timmons as \u201cthe Three Stooges.\u201dThe trio have all taken part in a side band called ATCK (All the Cool Kids), which was formed by McLean and Brandon Mashburn (DJ Lux) and includes a rotating lineup of musicians, according to Variety.McLean, Kirkpatrick and Timmons even joked about doing a concert event that would make any J-14 subscriber freak out: a 98 Degrees, Backstreet Boys and \u2019N Sync World Stadium Tour.While the mention of such a tour was merely a joke by Timmons, we can\u2019t help but add that we think it\u2019s an absolutely brilliant idea.

That would be \u201cCruella,\u201d of course, darling.Just two weeks after its release, a sequel to the Emma Stone-fronted origin story is already in development at the House of Mouse, according to The Hollywood Reporter, with the film\u2019s director Craig Gillespie and writer Tony McNamara set to return. There\u2019s no word yet on whether Stone will reprise her role as the iconic villain, but, as Variety notes, it\u2019s \u201cunclear how a sequel would work without her.\u201d Presumably, Paul Walter Hauser and Joel Fry, who play Cruella\u2019s accomplices Horace and Jasper in the film, would also be back for more fur-loving fun. \u201cCruella\u201d has been a hit for Disney after simultaneously debuting in theaters and on the studio\u2019s streaming service, where it was available to rent for an extra $30 Premier Access fee. Despite the hybrid release model, the film still managed to pull in some promising numbers at the coronavirus-impacted box office, taking in an estimated $48.5 million worldwide to date.\u201cWe are very pleased with Cruella\u2019s box office success, in conjunction with its strong Disney+ Premier Access performance to date,\u201d a Disney spokesperson said in a statement to Variety. \u201cThe film has been incredibly well received by audiences around the world, with a 97% Audience Score on Rotten Tomatoes in addition to A\u2019s in every demographic from CinemaScore on opening weekend, ranking it among the most popular of our live-action reimaginings. We look forward to a long run as audiences continue to enjoy this fantastic film.\u201dAs for how the story for the sequel-to-the-prequel would unfold, Cruella\u2019s exploits have already been well-covered in past films. Glenn Close previously played the character in the 1996 live-action remake of the beloved animated film \u201c101 Dalmatians\u201d and reprised the role in the sequel \u201c102 Dalmatians\u201d four years later. But Gillespie has gone on the record saying there\u2019s still much more to be seen from Stone\u2019s version of the villain, explaining that he\u2019d \u201clove to now see the full-blown Cruella, fully loaded.\u201d\u201cI feel like we\u2019ve only just met her,\u201d he told Collider in a recent interview. \u201cShe\u2019s managed to get the support system around her and she can really expand on her brand. I\u2019d love to see where that takes her and how you could almost destroy her from inside out, if she\u2019s not careful with all that power.\u201dAnd, who knows? Close might even get the last maniacal laugh and return to the franchise, as she proved in a deliciously unhinged video last year that Cruella is still near and dear.A post shared by The Real Glenn Close (@glennclose)Senior Reporter, HuffPostBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Gavin MacLeod, the veteran supporting actor who achieved stardom as Murray Slaughter, the sardonic TV news writer on \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show,\u201d before going on to even bigger fame as the cheerful Capt. Stubing on \u201cThe Love Boat,\u201d has died. He was 90.MacLeod died early Saturday, his nephew, Mark See, told Variety. MacLeod\u2019s health had been poor recently but no cause of death was given, the trade publication reported.Known to sitcom fans for his bald head and wide smile, MacLeod toiled in near anonymity for more than a decade, appearing on dozens of TV shows and in several movies before landing his \u201cMary Tyler Moore\u201d role in 1970.He had originally tested for Moore\u2019s TV boss, Lou Grant, a part that went to Ed Asner. Realizing he wasn\u2019t right for playing the blustery, short-tempered TV newsroom leader, MacLeod asked if he could try instead for the wisecracking TV news writer, his jokes often at the expense of the dimwitted anchorman Ted Baxter.\u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d was a smash from the start and remains a classic of situation comedies. It produced two spinoffs, \u201cRhoda\u201d and \u201cPhyllis,\u201d starring Valerie Harper and Cloris Leachman, who had portrayed Mary\u2019s neighbors.It was still top-rated when Moore, who played news producer Mary Richards, decided to end it after seven seasons.MacLeod moved on to \u201cThe Love Boat,\u201d a romantic comedy in which guest stars, ranging from Gene Kelly to Janet Jackson, would come aboard for a cruise and fall in love with one another.Although scorned by critics, the series proved immensely popular, lasting 11 seasons and spinning off several TV movies, including two in which MacLeod remained at the cruise ship\u2019s helm. It also resulted in his being hired as a TV pitchman for Princess Cruise Lines.\u201cThe critics hated it. They called it mindless TV, but we became goodwill ambassadors,\u201d he told the Los Angeles Times in 2013.Among his final TV credits were \u201cTouched by An Angel,\u201d \u201cJAG\u201d and \u201cThe King of Queens.\u201dMacLeod\u2019s lighthearted screen persona was in contrast to his private life. In his 2013 memoir, \u201cThis Is Your Captain Speaking,\u201d MacLeod acknowledged that he had struggled with alcoholism in the 1960s and \u201970s. He also wrote that losing his hair at an early age made it hard for him to find work as an actor.\u201cI went all over town looking for an agent, but no one was interested in representing a young man with a bald head,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI knew what I needed to do. I needed to buy myself a hairpiece.\u201d A toupee changed his luck \u201cpretty quickly.\u201d By middle age, he didn\u2019t need the toupee.MacLeod, whose given name was Allan See, took his first name from a French movie and his last from a drama teacher at New York\u2019s Ithaca College who had encouraged him to pursue an acting career.After college, the Mount Kisco, New York-native became a supporting player in \u201cA Hatful of Rain\u201d and other Broadway plays, and in such films as \u201cI Want to Live!\u201d and \u201cOperation Petticoat.\u201dHe made guest appearances on TV shows throughout the 1960s, including \u201cHogan\u2019s Heroes,\u201d \u201cHawaii Five-O\u201d and \u201cThe Dick Van Dyke Show.\u201d He also appeared on \u201cMcHale\u2019s Navy\u201d from 1962 to 1964 as seaman Joseph \u201cHappy\u201d Haines.One major role he auditioned for: Archie Bunker in \u201cAll in the Family.\u201d But he quickly realized that the character, immortalized by Carol O\u2019Conner, was wrong for him. \u201cImmediately I thought, \u2018This is not the script for me. The character is too much of a bigot.\u2019 I can\u2019t say these things,\u201d MacLeod wrote in his memoir.Other movie credits included \u201cKelly\u2019s Heroes,\u201d \u201cThe Sand Pebbles\u201d and \u201cThe Sword of Ali Baba.\u201dMacLeod had four children with his first wife, Joan Rootvik, whom he divorced in 1972. He was the son of an alcoholic and his drinking problems helped lead to a second divorce, to Patti Steele. But after MacLeod quit drinking, he and Steele remarried in 1985.The couple later hosted a Christian radio show called \u201cBack on Course: A Ministry for Marriages.\u201dBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

He also said listeners eager for classic breakup tracks \u2014 which have basically become synonymous with the country genre \u2014 won\u2019t be disappointed, calling out his new songs \u201cNow I Don\u2019t\u201d and \u201cMakin\u2019 It Up As You Go.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s something about sad songs, lyrically, that have fun, happy melodies that I just can\u2019t get enough of,\u201d he said in the clip about the new album, which hit streaming platforms last week. A post shared by Blake Shelton (@blakeshelton)Shelton, a nine-time Grammy nominee, is at a high point in his career. He was handed his eighth win as a coach on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice\u201d when Cam Anthony swept to victory this week, making him the coach with the most wins in the history of the singing-competition show. Similarly, his engagement to pop superstar Gwen Stefani has kept interest in his love life at an all-time high. \u201cBody Language\u201d has been warmly received by critics thus far, but the album\u2019s rollout got off to a shaky start with the release of single \u201cMinimum Wage\u201d in January. Shelton earned backlash for lyrics like: \u201cGirl lookin\u2019 at you, looking at me that way / Could make a man feel rich on minimum wage.\u201dThe singer said people had misinterpreted the overriding metaphor of the song and taken lyrics out of context. \u201cIt\u2019s literally a love song about how if times are tight and you ain\u2019t got much money \u2014 as long as you have love and you\u2019re happy \u2014 at the end of the day, that\u2019s all any of us can really hope for,\u201d he told CMT. \u201cYou got it if you got that.

Sitting on the couch of the Central Perk set, Kudrow sings the opening lines before Gaga enters, guitar in hand.Dressed in her Phoebe Buffay finest, Gaga takes a seat next to Kudrow, telling her it\u2019s \u201cone of my favorite songs,\u201d before asking if she can \u201ctake \u2018Smelly Cat\u2019 for a spin?\u201dGaga proceeds to belt out the song, much to the delight of Kudrow, who jokingly tells her, \u201cThat\u2019s not bad.\u201d \u201cYou may not be a bed of roses / You\u2019re not friend to those with noses,\u201d Gaga continues, before gesturing to her own nose \u00e0 la \u201cA Star Is Born.\u201d (For what it\u2019s worth, this performance would absolutely be Jackson Maine-approved.) But, remember, this special has a budget, so before long a gospel choir emerges to provide some background vocals and give the song some extra oomph, as Gaga and Kudrow finish it off with some final flourishes. The bit ends on a heartfelt note, with Gaga telling Kudrow just how much her character meant to viewers all these years. \u201cCan I just say something? Thank you for being the person for all of us on Friends \u2026 I don\u2019t know if this is the right way to say it, but the different one or the one that was really herself,\u201d Gaga told Kudrow.\u201cThank you,\u201d the actor said in return. \u201cAnd thanks for carrying it along.\u201d Gaga, who was among a slew of famous guests to appear in the special, apparently \u201cjumped at the chance\u201d to sing with Kudrow, despite having little rehearsal time. \u201cI said to Lisa, \u2018Would you be prepared to sing it?\u2019 And she was like, \u2018Yeah, that would be fun,\u2019\u201d director Ben Winston recalled to Variety. \u201cWe went through a few names, and we both agreed that Gaga, if we could get her, would be the ultimate one because she associates with and feels close to Phoebe in so many ways, as Gaga says on the show.

{"category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "text": "Tim Tebow and Urban Meyer are together again, this time in the NFL and with Tebow playing a new position.The former Florida star and 2007 Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback signed a one-year contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars on Thursday and will attempt to revive his pro career as a tight end. The move also reunites two of college football\u2019s most polarizing figures over the past 15 years.The 33-year-old Tebow is returning to the NFL after five years (2016-20) in the New York Mets\u2019 organization and he\u2019ll be playing for Meyer for the first time since his senior year in 2009.\u201cI know it will be a challenge, but it is a challenge I embrace,\u201d Tebow said in a statement. \u201cI am dedicated to taking the direction of our coaching staff and learning from my teammates. I appreciate everyone\u2019s support as I embark on this new journey.\u201dHe will be on the field with his new team Thursday and wearing No. 85 for a voluntary, closed workout. Tebow is not expected to have any media availability until training camp, at the earliest, in hopes of minimizing the media circus that follows the devout Christian who has received rock star treatment at every NFL stop.His comeback is unprecedented because of his age, his new position and the fact that he last played in a regular-season game in 2012, with the New York Jets.Several teams suggested Tebow make the position change years ago, but he declined.He finally switched after retiring from baseball in February. He worked out for the Jaguars the following week, the first of two exploratory sessions that came to light hours before the start of the NFL draft on April 29.Meyer raved about Tebow\u2019s workouts, saying assistants were surprised to see the 235-pounder in such great shape. Ultimately, Tebow\u2019s ability to pick up a new position \u2014 a number of college QBs have made the transition look seamless \u2014 will determine whether he makes the team.Just getting a chance after such a lengthy layoff has stirred debate about preferential treatment. Others insist it\u2019s merely the result of a decadeslong relationship that now includes Meyer and Tebow being neighbors in Jacksonville.\u201cThis Tebow deal just shows that personal relationships go further at this level than actual ability,\u201d Carolina Panthers defensive tackle DaQuan Jones posted on Twitter last week.Former Dallas receiver Dez Bryant, current Pittsburgh linebacker Devin Bush and Denver safety Kareem Jackson were among a number of others who criticized the move.\u201cSo Tebow haven\u2019t played an NFL game in damn near a decade and it\u2019s that simple \u2026 no hate but you got to be kidding me,\u201d Bryant tweeted.Added Jackson: \u201c... he got more lives than a cat.\u201dBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

Moakler, who was married to Barker for four years before divorcing in 2008, went onto allege, \u201cHe had already had an affair with Paris Hilton. And \u2026 at the time Kim was Paris\u2019s closet organizer, they were best friends. And he started using [Kim] as a model for [his clothing company], Famous Stars and Straps.\u201dShe said that she asked her then-husband \u201cnot to use\u201d Kim Kardashian as a model, given her ties to Hilton, because the couple was \u201cworking on our marriage and trying to heal through that affair, that infidelity, [but] he continued to [work with her].\u201d\u201cI received all the text messages and the other third parties kind of let me know. It\u2019s something I was well aware of,\u201d Moakler added. \u201cHe is dating her sister now, so I think that would be really weird.\u201dMultiple unnamed sources have denied Moakler\u2019s claim, with one telling Page Six that \u201cTravis and Kim have never had a romantic relationship\u201d and \u201cthey were friends who met through Paris Hilton and that is also how Kourtney and Travis were introduced.\u201d The Kardashian camp has yet to publicly shoot down the speculation, but the longtime rumor has gotten some legs in recent days. Barker and Moakler\u2019s daughter, Alabama, recently shared a screenshot of an apparent DM from her mom that read in part, \u201cI divorced Travis because I caught him having an affair with Kim! Now he\u2019s in love with her sister\u2026It\u2019s all gross\u2026I\u2019m not the bad guy!\u201dThe musician hasn\u2019t exactly been coy about his past attraction to Kim Kardashian, telling Us Weekly back in 2015, \u201cHow could you not stare at Kim? Mind you, I enjoyed hanging out with Paris, but I love curvy girls. Kim was eye candy. I was in no way disrespectful to Paris, but I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off Kim.\u201d However, he also insisted in his 2015 book that he \u201cnever touched\u201d Kim Kardashian despite their connection, according to Us Weekly.Somewhere out there, Tristan Thompson is breathing a sigh of relief that at least he\u2019s not involved in this mess.

The Disney+ series \u2014 which puts a mockumentary twist on 2006\u2019s \u201cHigh School Musical,\u201d which starred Zac Efron and Vanessa Hudgens \u2014 follows a group of young thespians at Utah\u2019s fictional East High School.This time around, the teen troupe is at work on a production of Disney\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d though that tale as old as time can\u2019t compare to the behind-the-scenes drama taking place on the show. Offstage romances abound, most notably between skateboarder-turned-leading man Ricky Bowen (played by Bassett) and theater devotee Nini Salazar-Roberts (Olivia Rodrigo).\u201cIn Season 1, Ricky did a lot of running away from his problems, and I think in Season 2, he\u2019s really trying to face his fears,\u201d Bassett, 20, told HuffPost. \u201cEven though he\u2019s trying his best, he falls on his face, but really does have the best intentions. He\u2019s still a teenage boy who\u2019s figuring this whole high school thing out.\u201dThe choice of \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d meanwhile, turned out to be a full-circle moment for the actor, who played Chip in a community production when he was 11. (Spoiler alert: In the first three episodes screened for press, his role this time around will involve a giant fur wig.) \u201cThat show has a special place in my heart,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m super stoked to bring those songs back and do them in our own \u2018HSM\u2019 way.\u201dBy all accounts, \u201cHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series\u201d has been a star-making vehicle for Bassett, who made his television acting debut in Fox\u2019s short-lived \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d series in 2017. The Oceanside, California, native has spent the first half of 2021 amid a frenzy of media scrutiny after Rodrigo released her smash single, \u201cDrivers License,\u201d in January. Many fans interpreted the song as an ode to a real-life, behind-the-scenes romance between her and Bassett, and their subsequent breakup. (Rodrigo\u2019s subsequent singles, \u201cDeja Vu\u201d and the just-released \u201cGood 4 U,\u201d also allude to heartbreak and have kept the TikTok crowd buzzing.)And earlier this week, Bassett \u2014 who has been romantically linked with \u201cGirl Meets World\u201d actor Sabrina Carpenter \u2014 went viral after he gushed over \u201chot\u201d Harry Styles in an interview with Clevver News that he deemed \u201cmy coming out video.\u201dOn Tuesday, he posted a note to his social media platforms clarifying his remarks somewhat but notably did not label his sexuality. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to still be figuring out who you are,\u201d he said at the time. Fortunately, Bassett doesn\u2019t seem fazed by the attention. \u201cPeople are going to have their opinions on who Ricky and Nini should be with,\u201d he said. \u201cIt starts to bleed into real life, and people make assumptions about what they want to happen. I can\u2019t take it personally, because it\u2019s not founded in truth. Most people are making theories up. They\u2019re just not informed.\u201d Fans seeking insight into his life, he said, would be best served by checking out his new music. In March, he released his six-song debut EP, and last week, he showcased his musical versatility with the anthemic, made-for-summer single, \u201cFeel Something.\u201d\u201cMusic has always been fundamental to who I am,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s cool to go from playing Ricky to making honest songs from my perspective and get into the part of my life that\u2019s emotional and difficult. When you\u2019re writing music, you have a chance to really say something. It\u2019s forced me to grow in a lot of ways. I\u2019m really not afraid to throw paint at the wall and try a bunch of new things.\u201d And, of course, there\u2019s Season 2 of \u201cHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series,\u201d which Bassett hopes will resonate with those who\u2019ve experienced a \u201cperspective shifter\u201d of a year amid the COVID-19 crisis. \u201cI\u2019m thankful to have this group of people and the foundation we have as a family,\u201d he said when asked about the challenges of filming in a pandemic. \u201cWe had each other and had to push through and make some sacrifices, but it was worth it because of how special the show is, how special our family is.\u201d \u201cThis season is about what really matters outside of competition and education at the end of the day,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s family, the people you love and who you really are, who you choose to be every single day.\u201d New episodes of \u201cHigh School Musical: The Musical: The Series\u201d premiere Fridays on Disney +.

And although fans may be upset that Plaza didn\u2019t get hitched to Michael Cera \u2014 a former co-star, whom she dated for a year and a half \u2014 or Chris Pratt (who played April Ludgate\u2019s goofball of a husband in \u201cParks and Rec\u201d), Baena seems like a good match for her, if his movies are any indication.Plaza has starred in two of Baena\u2019s offbeat films, \u201cLife After Beth\u201d (2014) and \u201cThe Little Hours\u201d (2017), the latter of which is about a convent of foul-mouthed, emotionally unstable and lustful nuns. The former involves a woman turning into a zombie. Both films also share several of the same cast members, including Molly Shannon, John C. Reilly and Paul Reiser. According to Plaza\u2019s post on Friday, Shannon will be involved in Baena\u2019s upcoming movie \u201cSpin Me Round\u201d \u2014 as will Fred Armisen, Lauren Weedman and Alison Brie, who were all also in \u201cThe LIttle Hours.\u201dPlaza and Baena appear to enjoy working together.
