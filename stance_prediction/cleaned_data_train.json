Both Trump's transition and Carrier have confirmed that a deal has indeed been struck.</p> \n\n<p>BREAKING: Trump team and United Technologies reach agreement on keeping close to 1,000 factory jobs in Carrier plant in Indiana - sources</p> \n\n<p>We are pleased to have reached a deal with President-elect Trump &amp;amp; VP-elect Pence to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indy. More details soon.</p> \n\n<p>The company had planned on moving thousands of jobs to Mexico, to the chagrin of workers and labor groups. On Thanksgiving Day, Trump said via Twitter that he was &#8220;working hard&#8221; to &#8220;get Carrier A.C. company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana).&#8221; After days of negotiation with Carrier, he seems to have succeeded in keeping his campaign promise.</p> \n\n<p>I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!</p> \n\n<p>Manufacturing jobs have been increasingly exported to foreign countries, including China and Mexico over the last few decades. Hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers have been laid off as a result. American manufacturers say, however, that in order to stay competitive in the global economy they need to keep costs low. The most efficient way to do that is to hire cheap foreign labor. Carrier Corp was looking to follow this formula to keep profit margins in the green.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The jobs at Carrier Corp. are on the way to Mexico because the company concluded that it could not stay competitive and reward its shareholders unless it took advantage of lower production costs south of the border,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-trump-carrier-20161128-story.html\" type=\"external\">reports</a> CNBC. &#8220;Things are as simple as that&#8230;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But Trump (or Mike Pence, who is still the governor of Indiana) managed to work his magic and convince Carrier&#8217;s parent company, UTC, to keep 1,000 jobs in Indiana where manufacturing jobs have been hemorrhaging for decades.</p> \n\n<p>Promising a combination of tax relief and regulation easing, Trump made an offer UTC couldn&#8217;t refuse. Left-wing economic populists like Bernie Sanders pushed Trump to make Carrier stay in the United States, suggesting that it was something the Trumpian right and labor left could agree on. Rather than incentivizing the conglomerate, Sanders and his allies were looking to use UTC&#8217;s multi-billionaire business relationship with the Pentagon as leverage. While Trump had promised to deploy similarly coercive tactics, such as high tariffs and penalties on companies that ship jobs abroad, he ultimately took a free market approach to the problem.</p> \n\n<p>During the presidential campaign, Trump called out Carrier by name and used the air conditioning company as an example of the worker unfriendly economic environment the United States has become.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;From the earliest days of his campaign, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/donald-trump?inline=nyt-per\" type=\"external\">Donald J. Trump</a> made keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States his signature economic issue, and the decision by Carrier, the big air-conditioner company, to move 2,000 of them from Indiana to Mexico was a tailor-made talking point for him on the stump,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/business/trump-to-announce-carrier-plant-will-keep-jobs-in-us.html?smid=tw-share\" type=\"external\">explains</a> The New York Times.</p> \n\n<p>Championing a populist economic message, Trump vowed to keep more jobs here in the United States. While technology will likely continue replacing manufacturing jobs at a much faster rate than foreign labor ever could, the billionaire businessman&#8217;s Carrier deal is a symbolic victory for the &#8220;America first&#8221; Trump movement.</p> \n\n<p>Without a doubt, it&#8217;s a good way to start a presidency. However, there&#8217;s only so much the federal government can do to alleviate the economic hardship of the Rust Belt, America&#8217;s manufacturing heartland. The steamboat of globalization and technological innovation cannot be tamed, let alone reversed. In short, there won&#8217;t be a manufacturing renaissance. That&#8217;s a pipe dream.</p> \n\n<p>Nonetheless, it looks like Trump came through this time around.</p> \n\n<p>Trump and future vice-president/current Indiana governor.

For most Americans, even many on the left, the true severity of this rant went unnoticed.</p> \n\n<p>You see, when someone in Trump&#8217;s position does something like this, as opposed to a private citizen or even presidential candidate, there are a whole mess of legal issues that become involved.</p> \n\n<p>For starters, a&amp;#160;president doesn&#8217;t have the power to single-handedly order a wiretap. Meaning that, if Trump or anyone associated with him were&amp;#160;monitored, a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA court)&amp;#160;would have had to grant&amp;#160;a warrant to do so. And the only way the FISA court would have done that is if they found probable cause.</p> \n\n<p>In case you didn&#8217;t know, the FISA court was authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to oversee requests for surveillance of spies inside the United States by U.S. intelligence agencies. The Chief Judge&amp;#160;appointed to oversee the court is Rosemary Collyer, a United States District Court judge who was appointed by George W. Bush. She was then given her position on the FISA court by Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts &#8212; who was also&amp;#160;picked by Bush and heavily supported by the Republican party.</p> \n\n<p>So, right off the bat Trump&#8217;s claim, if true, would indicate that the evidence surrounding <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">these Russian allegations</a> was sound enough that the FISA court found probable cause to approve the surveillance.</p> \n\n<p>In other words, if we&#8217;re to take Trump at his word, it&#8217;s not&amp;#160;Obama&amp;#160;who &#8220;bugged Trump Tower,&#8221; it was U.S. intelligence officials presenting evidence to the FISA court which then approved the monitoring of communication within that building over suspicion that Trump, or members of his campaign, engaged in possible <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">treasonous contact with Russian officials</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Most people have concluded that Trump&#8217;s tantrum was triggered by a Breitbart article &#8212; which was based off comments made by right-wing conspiracy theorist Mark Levin &#8212; claiming there&#8217;s a &#8220;police state&#8221; being secretly run by Obama to create some sort of &#8220;coup.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Again, any wiretapping of Trump Tower would have been granted by the FISA court amid&amp;#160;overwhelming&amp;#160;evidence of Russian links to Trump or his associates. If Trump wants to continue to claim this is true, then he&#8217;s either accusing Barack Obama of a blatant crime that&amp;#160;should be investigated immediately, or he&#8217;s admitting that the FISA court found enough evidence of Russian ties to approve these supposed wiretaps.</p> \n\n<p>So it&#8217;s either one or the other. Either Trump is:</p> \n\n<p>Well, then there&#8217;s always the possibility&amp;#160;that, because <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">he&#8217;s an unhinged moron</a>, he simply read this article in Breitbart, threw&amp;#160;another ridiculous hissy fit on Twitter, and he has absolutely no damn idea what he&#8217;s talking about. Hell, he compared this to Watergate, proving that he doesn&#8217;t even understand what the Nixon-era scandal was about.</p> \n\n<p>But the kicker to this is, Trump&#8217;s incompetence has opened the door for a public reveal of the details surrounding why, if true, the FISA court approved any requests to monitor anything related to him or his associates. After all, even if you&amp;#160;think Trump&#8217;s mentally unstable, he was clearly serious when he made these comments. Considering the office he currently occupies, his words should then immediately require an independent investigation &#8212; which means subpoenas &#8212; that would ultimately bring practically anything and everything related to this into public light.</p> \n\n<p>Because he has no idea what he&#8217;s doing, Trump has screwed himself over in several ways. If you take him at his word, and this is like &#8220;Watergate,&#8221; then he&#8217;s going to have to order extensive independent investigations, along with Congress being involved, into what he claims was a blatant and extremely illegal order by a Barack Obama to have Trump Tower put under surveillance.</p> \n\n<p>However, if he doesn&#8217;t do that, then he&#8217;s essentially admitting this whole rant was nothing more than pure ignorance, based on his trusting of a fringe, right-wing conspiracy site, and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">he&#8217;s too incompetent</a> to hold the position he currently occupies.</p> \n\n<p>That or he&#8217;s aware of the FISA court granting these warrants, he thinks they were illegal and not justified, so he should order all the information contained within them to be made public to &#8220;clear his name.&#8221; And if any FISA warrants related to investigations into him or his associates do exist, but he doesn&#8217;t want to make any of that information public, then he&#8217;s more or less admitting that they were credible and he doesn&#8217;t want people to know about the information that was used that led to their approval.</p> \n\n<p>The bottom line is, Donald Trump&#8217;s stupidity has basically led to one of four main possibilities:</p> \n\n<p>That&amp;#160;means the only positive outcome for Trump and Republicans is the extremely unlikely possibility that his accusations against Barack Obama are right. Otherwise, nothing good is going to&amp;#160;come of this for Trump or the Republican party.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>21 Facebook comments</p>", "title": "Trump\u2019s Desperate Attempt to Distract Americans From His Scandals Backfires \u2018Bigly\u2019", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://forwardprogressives.com/trumps-desperate-attempt-distract-americans-scandals-backfires-bigly/", "published_at": "2017-03-04", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Bad news for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL): The company needs to launch the &#8220;next big thing&#8221; in order to reverse investors&#8217; soured sentiment according to Barclays Capital analyst Ben Reitzes, and that next big thing could be Apple&#8217;s HDTV.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Why is that bad news?

He sees Apple unveiling its big plans for the living room some time in 2013, and he says he believes Apple is &#8220;exploring a new service that integrates iOS, iCloud, iTunes and more content that would bring customers a new experience around a TV-like device.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The analyst continued, &#8220;We believe that the Apple version of TV may evolve into a product that is &#8216;always on&#8217; with the ability to display a variety of messages (texts, Facebook postings, Tweets, email, etc.), weather, pictures, news and other key information as well as even act as a video conferencing device [...] any Apple solution seems like it will need to work along side traditional cable and media arrangements.

You&#8217;ve got to verbalize. Or get it on paper.</p> \n\n<p>Why not just require a notarized letter from an attorney, or better yet, a license? If we&#8217;re going to go this far, maybe college kids who want to have sex should go to a DMV-like office to get permission.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>All joking aside, the fact that this is even an issue suggests that a lot of college kids are having sex they&#8217;re not comfortable with having. People don&#8217;t sign a waiver when they&#8217;re engaging in any activity with someone they know and trust. (My advice to college kids: if you feel like you need to have a written contract drawn up with your &#8220;partner,&#8221; you shouldn&#8217;t be having sex with them.)&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/01/college-sexual-assault_n_5247267.html\" type=\"external\">Some of the colleges under investigation right now for mishandling sexual assault cases</a> are the most liberal, anything-goes, sexually open institutions in America. They host extravagant &#8220;Sex Week&#8221; events and pass out condoms to freshmen. They talk a lot about &#8220;consent,&#8221; but very little about respect, caring, or good judgment. Plying a &#8220;yes&#8221; out of someone is all that matters.</p> \n\n<p>In an environment like this, the boundaries of consent begin to break down. Students&#8212;who face enormous peer pressure to participate in this free-for-all&#8212;have trouble saying &#8220;no&#8221; when they want to. Other students simply don&#8217;t respect a &#8220;no.&#8221; Add a huge amount of alcohol into the mix, and chaos ensues.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>This is the problem that college administrators and lawmakers are trying to fix.

The rest is history.</p> \n\n<p>As the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom approaches, the spirit of protest seems to be rekindling in many parts of the country. The Dream Defenders remain camped out in the Florida capitol, demanding justice for Trayvon Martin and an end to racial profiling; North Carolina's <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Moral Monday protesters</a> have rallied and committed civil disobedience each week, defying the far-right agenda of their state legislators. In New York, the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">coalition against stop and frisk</a> won its victory in court, but it took organizing, rallying, and yes, marching, to make it happen.</p> \n\n<p>It's a good time, then, for a new memoir by congressman and 1960s civil rights leader John Lewis. In March: Book One, out today from <a href=\"http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/march/760\" type=\"external\">Top Shelf Productions</a>, Lewis' history and the highs and lows of the civil rights movement are brought to life&#8212;vividly, as the memoir is in comic format.</p> \n\n<p>The first of three books follows a young Lewis from his family's farm in Alabama to college and to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), to lunch counter sit-ins, jail cells and a showdown with the mayor of Nashville. Co-written by Andrew Aydin, a staffer who's been with Lewis for years, and drawn by award-winning comics artist Nate Powell, the book makes history feel real and present in a way that few accounts of civil rights legends have managed to.</p> \n\n<p>Lewis and Aydin sat down with me during a visit to New York to discuss the new comic, their goal of inspiring and instructing a new generation, and where they're finding hope these days.</p> \n\n<p>Sarah Jaffe: This book is the first of three volumes, all with the title March. Why did you pick that title?</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: March is the spring, it's life, it's the beginning. So much happened in March. But it's also moving feet.</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: There was a quote that stuck with us very early on, it was something Dr. King said: &#8220;There's no sound more powerful than the marching feet of the determined people.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But March is so many different things. It is the need to march. It is March 7, 1965. There's so much meaning behind it, it seemed almost self-evident.</p> \n\n<p>Book 2 contains a very famous march. During the movement, the Congressman was so committed to action. There were so many moments where people wanted to talk, and he wanted to do. There's this scene in Book 2, when they're saying the violence is getting to be too much, we have to work out a solution, and they'd turn to John Lewis and say, &#8220;What do you think we should do?&#8221; And he would say, &#8220;We should just march.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>They would ask him again and he would say, &#8220;We should just march.&#8221; Finally they say, &#8220;John, everything you're saying is that we should march, but people are going to get hurt, people are going to get killed, it's your own foolish pride that's getting involved with that, you're just nothing but a sinner.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>And he's like, &#8220;I may be a sinner, but we're gonna march.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It so typifies his view on how to get things done. We can sit around and talk about it, we can make speeches, but really when it comes down to it, the hard part is doing the work. Taking action.</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: This may sound a little self-serving here, but my own organization, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, objected to the march in Selma. We had an all-night discussion, a debate whether we should march. It's clear to me that I should march. And I said, &#8220;I've been to Selma many many times, I've stood in line at the courthouse, I've been arrested, I've been to jail there. The local people want to march, and I'm going to march.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>So I jumped in the car with two of the young people, and I drove to Selma, late at night, got there at three or four in the morning, got our sleeping bags out, got up the next morning, got dressed, went to the church, and we lined up and we marched. The rest is history.</p> \n\n<p>Sometimes you just have to do what your spirit says do. Go for it.</p> \n\n<p>Why did you decide to do this as a comic?&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: I was working for the Congressman on the 2008 campaign as his press secretary, and we started talking about what we were going to do after we had our nights and weekends back. I admitted I was going to a comic book convention&#8212;in politics that gets you laughs, snickers, a little jeering. But the Congressman said, &#8220;You know, there was a comic book during the movement and it was incredibly influential.&#8221; That comic book was &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.ep.tc/mlk/\" type=\"external\">Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story</a>.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>I went home that night, Googled it, and read the story about how it <a href=\"http://theubs.com/features/themontstory.php\" type=\"external\">inspired the Greensboro 4</a>. I came back the next day and asked him &#8220;Why don't you write a comic book?&#8221;&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>The Congressman looked at me like I was crazy there for a second, but we talked about the comic from the '50s, and a couple weeks later I asked again, and the Congressman said, &#8220;OK, but only if you write it with me.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It just seemed to make sense, the idea of a comic book inspiring young people to get involved and also teaching them the tactics.</p> \n\n<p>The book uses President Obama's inauguration as a framing device. Can you talk about the decision to do that?</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: People ask me from time to time whether the election of Barack Obama was the fulfillment of Martin Luther King's dream, and I say, &#8220;No, it's just a down payment.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Because we're not there. More and more, people are saying that we still have a distance to travel, and that we cannot be at peace or be at home with ourselves in America until we create a truly multiracial democratic society, where no one is left behind, and it doesn't matter whether you're black or white, Latino or Asian-American or Native America, whether you're straight or gay. . And there's a way to do it. If you want to change things, you got to find a way to make some noise. You cannot be quiet.</p> \n\n<p>The lessons of March say, This is the way another generation did it, and you, too, can follow that path, studying the way of peace, love and nonviolence, and finding a way to get in the way. Finding a way to get in trouble&#8212;good trouble, necessary trouble.</p> \n\n<p>The book relates some of the experiences you had as a young person that led you to civil rights activism. Most people probably wouldn't think of raising chickens as a thing that would shape a civil rights leader.</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: It may sound sort of silly, sort of strange, but I wouldn't be the person I am today if it was not for those chickens.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>It was my calling to take care of these innocent little creatures. I'm convinced those chickens that I preached to in the '40s and the '50s tended to listen to me much better than some of my colleagues listen to me today in the Congress. Really! Most of those chickens were a little more productive. At least they produce eggs.</p> \n\n<p>They taught me discipline, they taught me patience, they taught me hard work and stick-to-it-ness.</p> \n\n<p>You talk about Emmett Till's death as a pivotal moment for you, and it seems like Trayvon Martin's death has been a touchstone for a new generation of activists. Yet both of their deaths came at a time when violence against young black men was not rare. Why do you think each case hit a nerve?</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: I think there are certain periods in our history&#8212;just a spark. &amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>I was 15 years old, working out in the field when I heard what happened. I kept thinking that it could happen to me, but especially to some of my cousins who lived in Buffalo, New York, who would come South in the summer to spend time with us.</p> \n\n<p>A few months later, when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat, one thing she said in later years was, &#8220;It's not just my feet that were tired, but also, I thought about Emmett Till.&#8221; I remember that very, very well.</p> \n\n<p>One of the things that the comic format does so well for this story is capture the violence and brutality that practitioners of nonviolence went through, both in preparation for and during actions. I particularly loved the sequence where one person quit training, saying it was too hard. Talk about the process of getting those moments on paper.</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: We provided the words, but [the artist] Nate Powell&#8212;I love his capacity to capture the drama, to bring it to life, to make it real. You can see it; you can feel it. Even though I lived through it, to see it there makes the words sing.</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: This is very much centered around stories that I've heard the Congressman tell to all these people over the years. Nate lifted that off the paper and made it something at a whole other level. He's very good at finding a natural flow for your eye.</p> \n\n<p>We tried make sure that it wasn't just accurate for the sake of telling the story, but accurate for the sake of instructing, so that people who have never been to a nonviolent workshop could read and understand what one was. Nate really captured that.</p> \n\n<p>Another thing I think the book did well was capture the real work that went on behind the scenes. We're so rarely shown how many years of preparation and organizing went into making movements happen. I'd love to hear about the challenges of showing that part of the story.</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: The planning, the training, the nitty-gritty organizing&#8212;you may wait for days or weeks or even months before you see something. But you do it. You're consistent and you're persistent, day in and day out.</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: You see how this work ethic has just been such an omnipresent force in the Congressman&#8217;s life since he was 17, 18 years old&#8212;or even before that, on the farm. I remember at several points asking &#8220;What time did that take place?&#8221; and he'd be like &#8220;Oh, 5:00, 6:00 a.m.&#8221; And you realize these are college kids. How many college kids today get up at 5:00 in the morning, much less to go to an organizing meeting before class?</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: On April the 19, 1960, the attorney for the Nashville movement who had defended the students, his home was bombed around 6:00 a.m. And by 6:30 or 6:45 we were in a meeting. Students came from all over the city and we made a decision&#8212;it was a consensus&#8212;that we would have a march from the heart of the student community down to city hall. We sent the mayor of the city a telegram to meet us at high noon. There were more than 4,000 students saying, &#8220;Mr. Mayor, do you favor desegregation of the lunch counters?&#8221; And the next day, the banner headline in the local paper read that the Mayor said Yes to the integration of the lunch counters.</p> \n\n<p>It was that sense that we had to act, we had to do something, we couldn't wait.</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: You always say, &#8220;You gotta get up! You can't sleep through the revolution!&#8221;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>The anniversary of the March on Washington is approaching quickly, and it's never seemed more relevant in my lifetime. We're seeing renewed attacks on civil rights and voting rights, along with a renewed movement for racial and economic justice. How are you feeling about the present day?</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: In spite of all the problems and difficulties, all the apparent setbacks, delays, I feel very hopeful, very optimistic. I think we are in the process of building a very powerful movement.</p> \n\n<p>North Carolina's governor just yesterday signed into law one of the most unbelievable pieces of legislation that would lead to a systematic, deliberate effort to suppress the votes of minorities, young people and the elderly. But in spite of that, I'm hopeful that we're going to continue to push, and it's going to start the fire for a real movement. Look at what's happening in North Carolina now, the Moral Mondays. It's a good sign. It'll spread around, not just the South, but around America.</p> \n\n<p>What do you hope that some of those young people involved in North Carolina, camping out in the capitol in Florida, what do you hope that they take away from this comic?</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: It's my hope that many of the young people will have an opportunity to read March and be inspired, and see another generation got out there and did what they could, and that we too must pick up and push the ball further down the road.</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: Some people have started getting advance copies, and one of them gave the book to his 9-year-old son.</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: It's a white man, right?</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: Yes. His kid read the book, enjoyed it, had a little trouble with Emmett Till's death, but it resonated with him, and so now he's put on a suit and is marching around his house demanding equality.</p> \n\n<p>What does that say about what we have to look forward to?</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: They shall lead the way. Like the children in Birmingham and Selma, Albany, Georgia and other parts. They led the way.</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: That's part of the bigger message that I think we'll really be able to get into after this book. Because the tactics that worked in Birmingham didn't necessarily work in Albany, and they had to change. Tactics in one city didn't work for every foe or every objective. From that original idea of the Montgomery bus boycott being useful as an example of successful nonviolent direct action, the whole premise is showing more and more examples of different tactics used to express different forms of opposition. As activists today look for new tactics to address their own opposition, they have inspiration and they see concrete examples of how things were reimagined but still stuck to the basic tenets, the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence.</p> \n\n<p>Panels from March: Book One courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/march/760\" type=\"external\">Top Shelf Productions</a>.

Instead Donald Trump went up to Pennsylvania to deliver a campaign speech on behalf of Rick Saccone, who is at risk of losing to Democrat Conner Lamb next Tuesday in a district that Trump won by twenty points. The rally was reminiscent of Trump&#8217;s aimless campaign speeches in 2016 where he pontificated like a mad evangelist for an hour or more.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NewsCorpse/posts/2069608633053921\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>In keeping with his practice of shrieking sermonizing, Trump made a point of attacking what he considers the the scourge of his existence: the media (video below). He rattled off the sort of derogatory slander that would ordinarily be reserved for bitter enemies of all that is righteous. It was a storm of damnation, both personal and broadly general.</p> \n\n<p>For instance, Trump lashed out at NBC&#8217;s Meet the Press calling it &#8220;A show now headed by sleepy eyes Chuck Todd. He&#8217;s a sleeping son of a bitch, I&#8217;ll tell ya.&#8221; Remember, this speech was at a daytime rally with children present. He also went after an unnamed &#8220;certain anchor on CNN&#8221; who he said was &#8220;fake as hell, CNN. The worst. So fake. Fake news.&#8221; And he wasn&#8217;t letting NBC off either. He ranted that they were &#8220;perhaps worse than CNN, I have to tell you. And MSNBC is horrible.&#8221; Continuing down that path of raw animosity he called MSNBC &#8220;third rate. And NBC, which is horrible. Their newscast, by the way is not doing well. On NBC network. They&#8217;re heading down the tubes.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>This might be a good time to inject some facts into the discussion. NBC&#8217;s newscast anchored by Lester Holt has <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/evening-news-ratings-week-of-dec-25-q4-2017/353818\" type=\"external\">won ten consecutive quarters</a> in the key advertising demographic of 25-54 year olds. They were also <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/in-february-world-news-tonight-wins-the-evenings-while-today-takes-mornings/358741\" type=\"external\">number one</a> in the most recent sweeps period of February 2018. And their morning news program, the Today Show, topped their competition (ABC&#8217;s Good Morning America and CBS This Morning) in both the demo and total viewers. As for MSNBC, Rachel Maddow has been <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">beating Trump&#8217;s BFF</a> Sean Hannity on a regular basis.</p> \n\n<p>But Trump wasn&#8217;t about to let mere reality interfere with his delusions. He went on to make a ludicrous and utterly nonsensical prediction about the media that he despises so, and which he is convinced hates him. Pointing to the press at the rally he said&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Six months prior to the election, every one of those guys &#8211; &#8216;We really endorse Donald Trump. We think he has to win.&#8217; You know why? Because if I don&#8217;t win the election their ratings are gonna go so far down they&#8217;re gonna be out of business, every one of them.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>WTF is he trying to say here? That the media that he accuses of trying to destroy him will suddenly reason that it&#8217;s in their interest to support him? If that&#8217;s true, then why wouldn&#8217;t they support him now for the same reasons? What&#8217;s more, he&#8217;s implying that the media&#8217;s surging ratings are the result of having him around to attack. Which means that more viewers are watching because they enjoy seeing him get hammered. That&#8217;s actually true. Every poll shows that Trump has the lowest approval rating of any president ever recorded. So people probably are happy to see him get cut down by responsible journalists whose reporting of Trump&#8217;s failures is just part their job.</p> \n\n<p>The tone that Trump sets in these rallies is decidedly hostile and un-American. He praises China&#8217;s Xi Jinping, who just maneuvered himself into being president for life (of which <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Trump is envious</a>). He declares that he blindly trusts Kim Jong Un&#8217;s promise to refrain from missile and nuclear testing. He protects Vladimir Putin&#8217;s Russia from sanctions mandated by Congress as punishment for their election tampering. Trump speaks of these and other anti-democratic tyrants in radiantly glowing terms. But he viciously insults fellow Americans who practice their Constitutionally protected right to freedom of the press. And he thinks that&#8217;s how to MAGA &#8211; or KAG, as he now says (Keep America Gross).</p> \n\n<p>How Fox News Deceives and Controls Their Flock: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QSSMOES/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00QSSMOES&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=newscorpsecom-20&amp;amp;linkId=TLI6JC2OYE22MUTS\" type=\"external\">Fox Nation vs. Reality: The Fox News Cult of Ignorance.</a> Available now at Amazon.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "In Unhinged Speech Trump Slobbers Over Foreign Despots While Attacking America\u2019s Free Press", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://newscorpse.com/ncWP/?p%3D31230", "published_at": "", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Photo from flickr user floridapfe</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>In today&#8217;s New York Post there&#8217;s a Sean Delonas <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/delonas/2009/02/02182009.jpg\" type=\"external\">cartoon</a> that shows two policemen standing over a dead chimpanzee. One is holding a handgun while the other says, &#8220;They&#8217;ll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Al Sharpton is very offended. But he shouldn&#8217;t be because the cartoon isn&#8217;t offensive, unless you&#8217;re an ape.</p> \n\n<p>Sharpton issued a statement <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2009/02/18/al-sharpton-monkey-cartoon-obama/\" type=\"external\">saying</a>:</p> \n\n<p>The cartoon in today&#8217;s New York Post is troubling at best given the historic racist attacks of African-Americans as being synonymous with monkeys. One has to question whether the cartoonist is making a less than casual reference to this when in the cartoon they have police saying after shooting a chimpanzee that &#8220;Now they will have to find someone else to write the stimulus bill.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Being that the stimulus bill has been the first legislative victory of President Barack Obama (the first African American president) and has become synonymous with him it is not a reach to wonder are they inferring that a monkey wrote the last bill?</p> \n\n<p>Well actually, yes, it is a reach. That&#8217;s why the New York Post refuses to apologize and issued this <a href=\"http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/race/2009/02/outraged-readers-complain-about-chimp-cartoon-.html\" type=\"external\">statement</a>:</p> \n\n<p>The cartoon is a clear parody of a current news event, to wit the shooting of a violent chimpanzee in Connecticut. It broadly mocks Washington&#8217;s efforts to revive the economy. Again, Al Sharpton reveals himself as nothing more than a publicity opportunist.</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;ll leave Sharpton&#8217;s motivation alone, but this whole thing seems a little puzzling. Consider three recent events.</p> \n\n<p>Guess which one of these is irrelevant to the cartoon? If you picked&amp;#160; #1, you&#8217;re right. This cartoon has nothing to do with the ethnicity of Obama&#8217;s father and everything to do with the fact that the stimulus bill is messy. So messy, in fact, that it could have been written by a chimpanzee.</p> \n\n<p>The truth is, it&#8217;s not a good cartoon. Because it is an awkward attempt to combine two unrelated news stories, it doesn&#8217;t resonate, not in the way that <a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_q0ioDxOSoAA/Rwuul_0jFnI/AAAAAAAAABA/f1eVEc3HV2A/s200/nycover3.jpg\" type=\"external\">this</a> really wonderful cartoon does. You many not even get the cartoon at all (stimulus=monkey?), but that&#8217;s understandable because it&#8217;s not that funny; it&#8217;s just not racist either.

Kay appeared before a Senate subcommittee to disclose his findings and admitted that he and his team had found no stockpiles of proscribed weapons in Iraq.</p> \n\n<p>At one point he opined, &#8220;We were wrong, we were all wrong.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Wrong?</p> \n\n<p>An estimated 8,000 innocent Iraqis died in the invasion, more than 500 American servicemen were killed in action, an entire country was destabilized and plunged into insurgency, and David Kay talks about being wrong like it was some minor miscalculation on the phone bill?</p> \n\n<p>This is the reality of the Bush Administration&#8217;s new &#8220;preemptive&#8221; theory; hundreds of billions of dollars are spent, countless lives are lost or ruined, and the world community is thrown into turmoil, and yet, no justification is provided.</p> \n\n<p>Even worse, the head of the weapons inspection team presents his case to Congress as though it was all &#8220;just an honest mistake&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>So, why did Kay choose to address the Senate in the first place?</p> \n\n<p>After all, Kay has been a reliable Bush loyalist, and that hasn&#8217;t changed.</p> \n\n<p>Kay&#8217;s real intention in addressing the Senate was to use the CIA as a scapegoat for the bad information that led to the war. Now, that the election is approaching, the President&#8217;s chief advisor, Karl Rove, is trying to put as much distance as he can between the White House and the myriad lies about the non-existent weapons.</p> \n\n<p>This is a delicate situation and has to be handled with great subtlety or intelligence agencies will see that Bush is trying to bury them in the media. Hence, the appearance of David Kay is intended to reinforce the false notion that the war was the result of faulty intelligence. Kay&#8217;s testimony challenged the reliability of intelligence gathering methods and suggested that we may need a &#8220;major overhaul&#8221; of the intelligence services.</p> \n\n<p>Absent from the testimony was any detailed recounting of the many fabrications that were repeated with propaganda-like precision to support the war. Also, absent was the clear implication that the Administration was directly involved in &#8220;cherry-picking&#8221; intelligence to suit its own purposes.</p> \n\n<p>Apart from Senator Edward Kennedy, there was no mention of the fact that the Vice President was pressuring the CIA with frequent visits to produce information that was compatible with his own warmongering objectives, or that an Office of Special Plans was developed in the Pentagon for the expressed purpose of selectively manufacturing evidence that Saddam was a threat.</p> \n\n<p>Most of this passed by completely unnoticed. Instead, the Administration has adroitly used its main inspector to &#8220;move the shells&#8221; one more time, and shift the blame onto the undeserving CIA.</p> \n\n<p>But, the CIA doesn&#8217;t create policy and it doesn&#8217;t make the decision to go to war; the President does.</p> \n\n<p>The CIA was skeptical about the Iraq threat from the very beginning. Its reluctance to endorse the Bush preemptive policy was evident in an earlier report that clearly stated that a war in Iraq would increase the likelihood of terrorism in the region and, perhaps, force Saddam to give whatever weapons he had to terrorist organizations.</p> \n\n<p>This warning was ignored.</p> \n\n<p>It seems only appropriate that Kay would give his report on a day when six more American servicemen and eleven more Iraqis were killed. His loyalty to the Bush policy of unprovoked aggression provides an interesting contrast to the grim facts on the ground. Men and women are dying every day in what we know now was an entirely avoidable war.</p> \n\n<p>The testimony of David Kay only confirms that point.</p> \n\n<p>MIKE WHITNEY can be reached at: <a href=\"mailto:fergiewhitney@msn.com\" type=\"external\">fergiewhitney@msn.com</a></p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "The David Kay Report", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2004/01/30/the-david-kay-report/", "published_at": "2004-01-30", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>For the Halloween episode of <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/podcasts/answers/?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;referring_guid=b48e2aec-c2db-11e7-a29c-0050569d32b9&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Motley Fool Answers Opens a New Window.</a>, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp engage in a spirited discussion of the horrors some folks have visited upon their families' finances from the afterlife by making big mistakes in estate planning.</p> \n\n<p>In this segment, they discuss a nonfamous fellow, DuPont&amp;#160;employee William Kennedy, who -- as sometimes happens -- divorced his wife.

Not part of the famous Kennedy family. This Kennedy worked for DuPont and participated in the company's retirement plan. In 1994 he and his wife, whose name was Liv, got divorced and in the agreement she waived any rights to his retirement plan.</p> \n\n<p>Seven years later, William passes away. The money, however, was sent from the retirement plan to the wife. Why? Because William did not update the beneficiary form on his retirement plan. When you signed up for your 401(k) at work, you filled out the beneficiary form, but you also have that on IRAs. You have it on life insurance policies. There are all types of different assets and accounts in which you've filled out the beneficiary form.</p> \n\n<p>He didn't update it, so the daughter who should have [or at least she thought] should have inherited the money took it to court. Went all the way to the Supreme Court in 2009. They decided for Liv, the ex-wife. She's the one who gets the $400,000.</p> \n\n<p>Southwick: Oh, that's not bad! That's not too shabby.</p> \n\n<p>Brokamp: No, not too bad.

However deep their divisions, they keep them secret from the outside world.</p> \n\n<p>Not so the Libyan rebels. Members of their Transitional National Council (TNC) in Benghazi last month detained their military leader, General Abdel Fatah Younes, on suspicion of treachery, lured him away from his bodyguards and murdered him. This week the head of the TNC, Mustafa Abdel Jalil, sacked his whole government on the grounds that some were complicit in the killing. He was apparently forced to do so in order to quell the rage of the powerful Obeidi tribe to which Younes belonged.</p> \n\n<p>A ludicrous aspect of the whole affair is that at the very moment the rebel leaders are at each other&#8217;s throats, they are being recognised by country after country as the legitimate government of Libya. This week TNC diplomats took over the Libyan embassies in London and Washington and are about to do so in Ottawa. In a masterpiece of mistiming, Britain recognized the rebel government on the day when some of its members were shooting their own commander-in-chief and burning his body.</p> \n\n<p>If this is how the rebels behave today, when it is much in their interests to make a show of unity, how will they act once they are installed in power in Tripoli? But NATO&#8217;s sole policy is to do just that. A UN Security Council resolution, intended to stop Gaddafi&#8217;s tanks taking Benghazi for humanitarian reasons in March, transmuted rapidly into a bid to overthrow him. Britain and France, with essential backing from the US, still maintain that the good of the Libyan people requires the replacement of Gaddafi with those sturdy democrats from Benghazi and eastern Libya represented by the TNC.</p> \n\n<p>Could a strategy of brute force work in a purely military sense? Could the rebel columns of pick-up trucks with machine-guns in the back advance to capture Tripoli behind a creeping barrage supplied by NATO firepower? The Libyan capital is increasingly short of fuel, consumer goods and electricity.</p> \n\n<p>The rebels have been making gains on the ground to the east and south-west of the capital. But even with the support of NATO air strikes the advance has been slow. If the rebels make such a meal of taking a town like Brega, with a population of 4,000, on the Gulf of Sirte, can they really fight their way into Tripoli with a population of 1.7 million?</p> \n\n<p>Gaddafi may fall, but it looks increasingly that, if he does, it will be at the hands of a rag-tag collection of militias ever more dependent for success on being backed by tactical support from NATO aircraft. Given that the rebels lack a coherent leadership or a united military force, the outcome is unlikely to be a clear-cut victory. Even if victorious, the rebels will depend on foreign support at every level to exert authority over this vast country.</p> \n\n<p>As with Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, the US and Britain found it was one thing to overthrow the Taliban or Saddam Hussein and quite another to replace them. Treating dubious local allies as the legitimate government has a propaganda value, but it is unwise to pretend that the local partner carries real authority. With this experience under its belt, it required real fecklessness for Britain to plunge into another conflict on the assumption that this time we were betting on a certain winner. Gaddafi may be overthrown but the struggle for power between internal factions is likely to continue.</p> \n\n<p>Colorful, but woefully misleading</p> \n\n<p>The foreign media had its failings in Iraq, was worse in Afghanistan but has reached its nadir in covering the war in Libya. Reporting has become largely militarized. Much of it is colorful stuff from the frontline about the dashes backwards and forwards of rebel militiamen. It takes courage to report this and reporters naturally empathize with the young men with whom they are sharing a trench. Their coverage tends to be wholly in favor of the rebels and in opposition to Gaddafi.</p> \n\n<p>When Abdel Fatah Younes was murdered almost nobody in the foreign media had an explanation as to how or why it had happened. The rebel leadership, previously portrayed as a heroic band of brothers, turned out to be split by murderous rivalries and vendettas. Some reporters simply regurgitated the rebel authorities&#8217; unlikely claim that the general had been killed by pro-Gaddafi fighters with camps in Benghazi, while others mentioned that there were 30 different Islamic militias in the city.</p> \n\n<p>To this day politicians justify NATO&#8217;s intervention in Libya by citing atrocities supposedly carried out by pro-Gaddafi forces such as mass rape or extensive use of mercenaries. Human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch long ago revealed that there was no evidence for most of the atrocity stories, as did a UN commission headed by the distinguished legal scholar Cherif Bassiouni. These well-researched reports were almost entirely ignored by the media which first published the Gaddafi atrocity stories.</p> \n\n<p>The militarization of reporting in Iraq and Afghanistan was boosted by the system of &#8220;embedding&#8221; reporters with military units. This was inevitable to a degree given the danger from Iraqi insurgents or Taliban. But the outcome has been that war reporting has reverted to what it was during imperial skirmishes in the 19th century, with the world getting only a partial and often misleading account of what is happening in Libya.</p> \n\n<p>Patrick Cockburn&amp;#160;is the author of &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1416551476/counterpunchmaga\" type=\"external\">Muqtada: Muqtada Al-Sadr, the Shia Revival, and the Struggle for Iraq.</a></p>", "title": "Libya\u2019s Ragtag Rebels", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2011/08/11/libyas-ragtag-rebels/", "published_at": "2011-08-11", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Parliamentary official John Hemming has drawn attention to a new type of court order forbidding members of Britain&#8217;s fourth estate to cover cases deemed too sensitive for public consideration.

(NYSE: SCS) rose 12.8% Thursday after the office furniture specialist released weaker-than-expected fiscal second-quarter 2017 results, but offered encouraging guidance for a return to growth going forward.</p> \n\n<p>Quarterly revenue fell 7% year over year, to $758 million, and translated to net income of $38.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share. Excluding restructuring charges, Steelcase's net income fell 8.6% year over year, to $0.32 per diluted share. By contrast, Steelcase's outlook called for revenue in the range of $770 million to $795 million, but roughly the same earnings per share (on both a GAAP and adjusted basis) in the range of $0.29 to $0.33.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Steelcase CEO Jim Keane explained that July orders fell 8% in the Americas, leading to lower overall revenue than anticipated. But Keane also added:</p> \n\n<p>More specifically, Steelcase expects fiscal third-quarter revenue of $795 million to $820 million, including organic revenue growth of 1% to 4%. On the bottom line, Steelcase expects third-quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.32 to $0.36, including a $0.01 per-share negative impact from restructuring costs.</p> \n\n<p>By contrast, analysts' consensus estimates predicted Steelcase would achieve revenue of $807.4 million in the quarter, and adjusted earnings of $0.35 per share.</p> \n\n<p>Of course, that guidance wasn't overwhelmingly positive, and more than anything confirmed what Wall Street was hoping to hear. So in light of its relative underperformance in Q2, it's somewhat surprising to see shares of Steelcase climb so much in today's trading. To be fair, however, it's worth noting shares are still down more than 20% over the past year, indicating perhaps investors were were willing to buy Steelcase stock in light of any perceived turning point for the company.</p> \n\n<p>In the end, while I'm not personally anxious to dive in and buy Steelcase stock today, I think it's worth adding to your watch list to keep tabs on its progress.</p> \n\n<p>A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Stock Popped Today", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/markets/2016/09/22/why-steelcase-inc-stock-popped-today.html", "published_at": "2016-09-22", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>This week Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) reported a 93% jump in revenue compared to last year. It went public back in May and has seen its stock jump 86% since. That&#8217;s because Shopify (and its many competitors, from Magento to Bigcommerce) are considered to be the future of e-commerce for small retailers. And that&#8217;s true. But there&#8217;s also something else bigger than just e-commerce.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>That&#8217;s because applications like Shopify will be just as important to those many retailers where e-commerce isn&#8217;t as big a factor. And for those retailers, moving to this technology will be the difference not just for a successful holiday season but for long term survival as well.</p> \n\n<p>A small, real-life example. There is a pharmacy located in my neighborhood that has been around since the mid-1950&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a family business and it provides a livelihood for its owners. And every day I watch this little pharmacy slowly die. No, they don&#8217;t have an e-commerce presence &#8211; they barely have a website. But that&#8217;s not the real reason why they&#8217;re dying. &amp;#160;It&#8217;s because they&#8217;re getting crushed by larger competitors, a CVS (NYSE:CVS) and a Rite-Aid (NYSE:RAD) which is being acquired by Walgreen&#8217;s (NYSE:WAG), are each located a mile away. And yet, this little pharmacy doesn&#8217;t have to fail. It can compete against the big box stores. It can become vibrant and relevant and successful. They need the kind of technology that a Shopify has.</p> \n\n<p>Shopify and its competitors aren&#8217;t just e-commerce. They are mobile point-of-sale, payment and inventory management applications that are dovetailed with e-commerce. And that&#8217;s the big misunderstanding about applications like these.</p> \n\n<p>They are designed to be used both in-house and online. Shopify&#8217;s unlimited plan, which is less than $200 per month, will enable the little pharmacist down the street to take a big jump into the 21st century. Online, he can setup his own store where customers can search, order and pay for unlimited products for either delivery or pickup &#8211; a critical customer service in today&#8217;s attention-deficit-disorder world. But it&#8217;s in the store where products like Shopify will have the most impact.</p> \n\n<p>The application is designed for the iPad so that store employees, and yes even the pharmacist himself, can come out from behind the counter, walk the aisle and engage with customers face to face, helping them search for the right product, taking orders and even receiving payment. The application lets him offer gift cards and discount codes. If implemented the right way its inventory and reporting will allow the pharmacist to stay on top of his stock and analyze which products are moving the best. And I&#8217;m really just scratching the surface. This is all in-house stuff, not online. And we&#8217;re not getting this at the big box places. It&#8217;s a value-add that any smart business owner can do to strengthen his relationship with his customers and community.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>And there&#8217;s more technology for that that the brick-and-mortar retailer, like my pharmacist friend, to help him succeed.</p> \n\n<p>For example, he can use a free service called Happy E-Mail to make sure his customers are getting a special e-mail thank you from him after they&#8217;ve made their purchase. Or a specially designed purchase receipt from Receiptful that upsells on future items. Another free product called Limespot will prompt sales associates of opportunities to recommend other related products and accessories while still engaging with the customer in the store. A product called Sweet Tooth will offer customers points for their loyalty which they can use for discounts on future sales. These are just a few of the hundreds of apps available to enhance the in-store experience.</p> \n\n<p>And that&#8217;s the biggest misunderstanding: e-commerce and brick-and-mortar are becoming the same. &amp;#160;All retailers who want to grow will use technology like Shopify for both online and in-store. The store employee and the online visitor is searching the same inventory database. The loyalty programs and e-mail confirmations are being triggered whether the purchase is made in-store or via the web. Because of the cloud there&#8217;s no such thing as two systems &#8211; it&#8217;s all one system. It&#8217;s all mobile. And it&#8217;s all pretty inexpensive, even for the small retailer.</p> \n\n<p>So here&#8217;s what I would tell him to do: invest. Hire someone short-term to help (Shopify has a marketplace of experts and even more can be found on sites like UpWork). Move all inventory on to a platform like Shopify. Buy a few iPads from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and link to a few good loyalty and communication services. And get his employees walking around the store helping customers face to face. And don&#8217;t worry about ecommerce, because that&#8217;s part of the package. It&#8217;s all the same. It&#8217;s all one system. And it&#8217;s there to help him provide a much better service to his customers than the big chains down the street.</p>", "title": "The Biggest Misunderstanding About Shopify", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2015/11/05/biggest-misunderstanding-about-shopify.html", "published_at": "2016-03-06", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p><a href=\"http://pienews.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/K2.jpg\" type=\"external\" />Charles&amp;#160;Krauthammer&amp;#160;called&amp;#160;the new emails showing White House involvement in briefing U.N. ambassador Susan Rice before she spoke about the Benghazi attacks on the Sunday shows \"a serious offense\" and&amp;#160;\"a classic cover-up of a cover-up.\" The government watchdog group&amp;#160;Judicial Watch released the new Benghazi e-mails, which&amp;#160;reveal that a top White House [?]</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/376858/krauthammers-take-new-smoking-document-benghazi-emails-classic-cover-cover-nro-staff\" type=\"external\">Click here to view original web page at www.nationalreview.com</a></p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Krauthammer's Take: New Benghazi Emails a 'Classic Cover-Up of a Cover-Up'", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://politicalillusionsexposed.com/krauthammers-take-new-smoking-document-benghazi-emails-a-classic-cover-up-of-a-cover-up/", "published_at": "", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>By Henner Weithoener / Climate News Network</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;Fossil fuel production, as at this German mine, casts a long shadow.

Two groups working for a cleaner future want to see a levy imposed on fossil fuel exploitation.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>A 2013 report said almost two-thirds of the main greenhouse gas going into the atmosphere, carbon dioxide, came from the fuels produced by a mere 90 companies. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) summit here is in the final hours of its attempt to broker a just and effective global treaty on reducing those emissions and limiting their impacts: extreme weather, drought, flooding, sea level rise, land and forest degradation, desertification.</p> \n\n<p>Pressure is growing to work out if and how these big fossil fuel producers can be held financially responsible for the damage their products are causing.</p> \n\n<p>The 90 fossil fuel companies responsible for 63% of CO2 emissions from human activities are a roll call of household names, including Chevron, ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, BP, Gazprom and Shell.</p> \n\n<p>Now the Climate Justice Programme and the Heinrich Boell Foundation are urging that producers should pay a carbon levy on all fossil fuel extraction and mining, with the proceeds going to help pay poorer countries for adapting to climate change and meeting the costs of its impacts.</p> \n\n<p>Phase-out needed</p> \n\n<p>The levy would be applied to both the exploitation and the burning of fossil fuels. If a company was involved in both, it would have to pay the levy only once.</p> \n\n<p>It would charge the carbon majors US$2 for every tonne of carbon dioxide their products release into the atmosphere. In 2014 this would have meant $50 billion coming from the companies.</p> \n\n<p>The levy is based on a calculation of how much CO2 is released on average from burning a barrel of crude oil (or a tonne of coal, or a cubic metre of natural gas). The CO2 footprint of the drilling or mining itself would not be taken into account.</p> \n\n<p>\"We propose that a global fossil fuel extraction levy be established and paid into the international Loss and Damage Mechanism. This funding would be used to assist the poorest and most vulnerable communities suffering the worst impacts of climate change\", said Julie-Anne Richards of the Climate Justice Programme. \"This levy needs to be part of a general phase-out of fossil fuels.\"</p> \n\n<p>Precedents</p> \n\n<p>The UNFCCC's Loss and Damage Mechanism emerged from the 2013 climate summit in Warsaw. It is a way to address those climate impacts to which it is impossible to adapt, including extreme events.</p> \n\n<p>\"Climate finance is already inadequate - with a huge gap between what is needed and what is being offered. A new source of finance from a levy on Big Oil, Coal and Gas could unlock some of the objections by rich countries to including loss and damage in a new Paris agreement\", said Lili Fuhr from the Heinrich Boell Foundation.</p> \n\n<p>The Climate Justice Programme is convinced that existing international law, in particular the polluter pays principle, the no harm rule and the right to compensation support such a system.</p> \n\n<p>\"Our proposal draws from precedents such as the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, the oil spill compensation regime which collects levies from companies that ship oil internationally which are used as compensation after oil spills\", said Julie-Anne Richards.</p> \n\n<p>The fossil fuel industry has so far given no reaction to the levy proposal.</p> \n\n<p>Henner Weithoener is a Berlin-based freelance journalist specialising in renewable energy and climate change.</p>", "title": "A Carbon Levy Is Possible for Big Fossil Fuel Firms", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/a-carbon-levy-is-possible-for-big-fossil-fuel-firms/", "published_at": "2015-12-11", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>CarMax (NYSE:KMX) reported on Tuesday stronger-than-expected earnings for the second quarter, as the company&#8217;s profit leaped 26% amid stronger sales of used cars.</p> \n\n<p>Shares climbed 4.1% to $52.08 in pre-market trading.

Never at a loss for a cliche, I state that not long ago I was several leagues to the right of Genghiz Khan, and replied to Ye Ed that &#8220;I was a thorough-going, kill-a-commie-for-Christ, jackboot-wearing, there&#8217;s no-Gook-like-a-dead-Gook, card-carrying, liberal-hating fascist&#8221;. I am not and never have been anti-American, but I am decidedly against Bush and his Washington weirdoes, who have steered their country to aggressive and needless confrontation with every country that does not accept servile subordination to the Bush doctrine of imperial supremacy.</p> \n\n<p>There was one main reason for moving from fascist to liberal, and that was the fact that Washington and London tell us lies and that these lies are accepted and resold by people who should know better. My reaction to the announcement that the British Parliament&#8217;s report concerning Blair&#8217;s exaggerations about Iraq&#8217;s weapons of mass destruction was going to be published was that it would be a whitewash, otherwise they wouldn&#8217;t publish it. Now that is unhealthy, knee-jerk cynicism, but I didn&#8217;t get this way without a lot of help.</p> \n\n<p>When PG Wodehouse wrote humorously about Hollywood he invented a genus called nodders. First there was the film company&#8217;s president, then legions of vice-presidents, then there were the nodders whose job it was to attend conferences and agree, by deferential head inclination, with everything that was said. Far too many reporters and legislators are nodders.</p> \n\n<p>Take, for example, the botched attack on some vehicles and the rocketing of a tiny smugglers&#8217; hamlet near the Iraq-Syrian border by a deeply secret bunch of US killers supported by aircraft armed with more firepower than a trio of tank squadrons. The affair was a ludicrous, ham-fisted stuff-up. They killed a young woman and her one year-old child, and wounded then took prisoner six Syrian border guards and held them for almost two weeks without explanation. The sheer arrogance of the latter action is staggering. (We won&#8217;t even discuss human rights and murdering Iraqi civilians; there&#8217;s no point.) The affair was almost as bizarre as the detention of a dozen Turkish soldiers in northern Iraq, about which we were told nothing, either. Nothing, that is, that we can believe.</p> \n\n<p>These operations, I remind you, took place in our name. It was for the safety of the world that Bush and Blair went to war on Iraq, so they say, and that is you and me. And if killings and cock-ups are committed in our name, then we want to know about it. The reason we are told nothing, or lied to with blatant contempt, is that the operations were bungled, therefore they don&#8217;t want us to know about them. The Bush cabal and the Blair government-within-a-government told us grotesque lies, before, during and after their war. We all know the device of &#8220;senior government source&#8221; and &#8220;senior administration official&#8221;, and those of us who have our own sources, here and there, know on many occasions exactly who these people are. It is time &#8211; it is more than time &#8211; that the media refused to publicise &#8216;information&#8217; unless the source can be named. (&#8216;Cabal&#8217; was the name given to a clique of devious ministers appointed by Charles II; their surnames begin with the letters of the word. What about Cheney, Rumsfeld, Ashcroft and Powell?)</p> \n\n<p>If the Bush and Blair ju-ju men want to give the world some facts, they should go on the record. Here is one example of needlessly unattributable nonsense, from the New York Times on July 7 : &#8220;Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a senior Defense Department official said the soldiers who stormed the Turkish compound in Sulaimaniya on Friday were &#8216;acting on intelligence about possible illicit activities that were being planned against municipal officials in the region.&#8217; A senior American military official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed this account, saying the plot appeared to be aimed at the governor of Kirkuk, a nearby city.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>I don&#8217;t believe a word of it. Associated Press recorded that &#8220;Emel Begler, a Turkish cook who was among the detained together with her 15-year-old son, told reporters the US troops broke down the doors, placed sacks over their heads and handcuffed their hands behind their backs.&#8221; So she was plotting to kill the governor of Kirkuk, was she? Ratbane in his Freedom Fries, perhaps. But if the Turkish soldiers she cooked for were indeed plotting assassination, why were they then set free? What&#8217;s the real story?</p> \n\n<p>Why the anonymity in this and so many other cases? It appears to be a reflex action, like manacling and blindfolding male Iraqi civilians in order to humiliate them in front of their families. This sort of cave-man thug-stuff never used to happen. What is the point of it? All it does is feed the fires of fury against the US in Iraq, just as anonymous &#8212; cowardly, gutless, amoral &#8212; briefers exasperate and deceive us to the point that we don&#8217;t believe a damn word they say. Rumsfeld often insists he be described as a &#8220;senior defense official&#8221;, which is cowardice. If he&#8217;s got anything to say, let him be named as saying it. Creeping behind the shield of bureaucratic anonymity is the action of a lily-livered sleazebag. But the sycophantic nodders of the media hang on his every deceitful word.</p> \n\n<p>When you trawl the news sites on the Internet you can obtain a lot of accurate first-hand information from Reuters, AP, AFP and other reputable agencies, but when I see a story is sourced to Fox News or CNN I don&#8217;t even bring it up on the screen. After months of slewed and slanted rubbish from these unbelievably piffling, bimbo-ridden, nodder-outlets how could anyone trust them to give the right time of day?</p> \n\n<p>Do you remember the &#8220;defence department official&#8221; who told the Washington Post (which had a pretty iffy news source in one particularly well-embedded reporter) that Private Jessica Lynch had fought gamely to the last bullet and all that nonsense? She was injured, certainly &#8212; but in the shambles of a panic-stricken vehicle crash. The story about her &#8220;heroism&#8221; was fabrication. It was a downright damned lie. So who was the &#8220;official&#8221; who concocted this rubbish? He may have only briefly crawled out from beneath the large flat slimy stone under which he normally resides, but why was he not punished for telling us lies? Of course nothing of the sort will ever happen, and the reason for this is that the information system is rotten to its nodding core.</p> \n\n<p>The BBC, one of the last bastions of objectivity and truth, has been attacked by Blair&#8217;s scummy little ratbag mumbo-jumbo-meister, Alastair Campbell (&#8216;Calamity Ali&#8217;), for helping reveal that the Downing Street campaign to mislead the British public about reasons for the war on Iraq was largely successful. The outcome of the British parliamentary inquiry into this squalid affair was predictable, and not just by cynics like me. How on earth can one credit the results of an inquiry that was not allowed to interview the main liar (the prime minister), or have access to all classified reports? How could you believe a man like Blair, anyway, when he is on record, in a moment of political panic, as demanding his nodders think up some &#8220;eye-catching initiatives with which I personally can be associated&#8221;? Nothing that would benefit his country or its unfortunate citizens, you understand. Nothing of principle; just something that would look good. The man is a grubby charlatan.</p> \n\n<p>In any event the inquirers were a majority of nodder Labour MPs, and the committee&#8217;s clearing of Campbell for his shoddy behaviour was achieved by the chairman (a Blair man to his bootstraps) using his casting vote. This is nodder democracy. On no account would Blair permit an independent inquiry by a trio of impartial judges, with access to every detail of the affair. Such an inquiry would be, well, impartial, and that can&#8217;t be allowed, because we might learn the truth, presented to us by people we trust. And Blair and his people wonder why we don&#8217;t trust them. They couldn&#8217;t stretch out straight in bed; that&#8217;s why we don&#8217;t trust them.</p> \n\n<p>The same holds in the US. The Senate committee&#8217;s whitewash will be exactly the same as the Blair parliament&#8217;s lapdog performance, and there is no possibility that a Republican-dominated Congress could ever be critical of Bush, no matter how many lies he told. (Remember these repulsive lulus? : &#8220;Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds of miles&#8221;; Iraq &#8220;has trained Al Qaeda in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases&#8221;; &#8220;a report came out of the IAEA that [Iraq was] six months away from developing a [nuclear] weapon&#8221;. All lies.)</p> \n\n<p>This is why I changed from Genghiz Khan mode. The people we should be able to trust have been lying outrageously to political and journalistic nodders, who happily passed the lies on to us without question and even with embellishment. If you fed them nails, they&#8217;d crap corkscrews. The hell with the lot of them.</p> \n\n<p>BRIAN CLOUGHLEY writes about defense issues for CounterPunch, Dawn and other international publications.

The problems with Palo Alto's recent quarter range from increased spending to poor guidance and slowing revenue growth. And to make matters worse, it's a healthy dose of all three.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Despite landing on the wrong side of the earnings fence, Palo Alto responded positively in one of its primary initiatives: boosting its source of recurring revenue. However, as noted in a recent <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/05/25/3-things-to-watch-for-during-palo-alto-networks-in.aspx?source=eptfxblnk0000004\" type=\"external\">article Opens a New Window.</a> leading up to the May 26 announcement, Palo Alto investors' patience was only going to be tested for so long. At some point the company needs to perform beyond growing its top line, and it's running out of time.</p> \n\n<p>CEO Mark McLaughlin tried to temper expectations after reporting Palo Alto's second-quarter results by forecasting a 43% to 45% revenue improvement in Q3, ending its nearly two-year-long streak of reporting 50% or more quarterly sales growth. Palo Alto didn't quite reach the remarkable 50% revenue jump this past (fiscal third) quarter, but delivered a pleasantly surprising 48% gain, to $345.8 million. Analysts had expected sales of $339.48 million.</p> \n\n<p>On the earnings-per-share front, Palo Alto hit its high-end forecast of $0.42 on a non-GAAP (excluding one-time items) basis, which also matched pundits' expectations. Fiscal Q3 billings rose a whopping 61% last quarter, to $486.2 million, which would seemingly be a positive sign of what is to come in the current fiscal Q4. But it is not to be.</p> \n\n<p>If not reaching 50% revenue growth is partly to blame for Palo Alto's stock price nosedive, its forecast for the current quarter will be downright depressing. On the high end of McLaughlin's forecast, Palo Alto expects 37% revenue growth to end its fiscal year, or $390 million.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>On a more positive note, Palo Alto's services unit grew a whopping 63%, to $183.7 million, in Q3, and now represents 53% of total sales. Service sales, and the recurring revenue they generate, are a critical initiative for Palo Alto, and they took a step in the right direction last quarter.</p> \n\n<p>As noted before, Palo Alto has been on a spending spree for years to drive its stellar 50%-plus revenue jumps. But with growth beginning to slow -- Q3's results and this quarter's guidance are proof of that -- minimizing costs has become a necessity, not a nicety. The problem is, McLaughlin and team can't seem to keep their checkbooks in their pockets.</p> \n\n<p>A comparison with Palo Alto's peer and primary competitor,Check Point Software , demonstrates why the former's stock is down 26% year to date, and the latter's is up 3%. Palo Alto's total operating expenses of $309.5 million equaled 90% of sales. Check Point, on the other hand, spent 50% of last quarter's $404.3 million in revenue on its operating expenses.</p> \n\n<p>As for cost of revenue, Palo Alto spent $94.9 million to drive its product and services sales, more than twice Check Point Software's $45 million last quarter. Is it any wonder Check Point is profitable, on both a GAAP (including one-time items) and non-GAAP basis? And Check Point's profits continue to climb, too, rising 10% last quarter.</p> \n\n<p>Considering Palo Alto's slowing revenue growth and increased spending, it could be years before shareholders are in the black. Unfortunately, it gets worse because of the nature of Palo Alto's skyrocketing expenses. Check Point's sales and marketing costs equaled 23% of revenue in fiscal Q1, whereas Palo Alto's $202 million ate up a head-shaking 58% of its total sales last quarter.</p> \n\n<p>When investors add it all up, the answer is fairly straightforward: Slowing top-line growth was inevitable, but continuing to spend indiscriminately is not. Until McLaughlin reins in overheads, even improvement in services unit sales and the recurring revenue that comes with it won't be enough to placate shareholders. Nor should it be.</p> \n\n<p>The article <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/05/30/palo-alto-networks-inc-earnings-missed-where-it-ma.aspx\" type=\"external\">Palo Alto Networks Inc.

[The] less privileged, Negroes, Spanish-Americans, and poor whites, must fight a war in the name of principles such as freedom and equality of opportunity which their own nation has denied them.&#8221;&amp;#160; &#8220;Conscription,&#8221; they declared, has throughout American history &#8220;invariably been biased in favor of the wealthy and privileged.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Enter young Mitt Romney, right on cue, waving a sign denouncing the anti-war students.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;He, like his fellow almost all-male participants in this pro-war demonstration, fervently argued in support of the war and the draft.&amp;#160; But not, of course, for himself.</p> \n\n<p>When Mitt enrolled at Stanford back in the spring of 1965, the official and overt U.S. war (as distinct from the previous forms of proxy, clandestine, and &#8220;adviser&#8221; warfare waged in Vietnam for more than a decade) had just begun.&amp;#160; Operation Rolling Thunder, the sustained U.S. bombing of the north, had started on March 2.&amp;#160; The first officially acknowledged U.S. combat units were the Marines who went ashore at Da Nang on March 8 (joining the 24,000 U.S. military personnel already fighting in Vietnam).&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Draftees were not yet being used in combat.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; So Mitt and his dad clearly intended the fall of 1965 to be the beginning of a fine four-year career at Stanford for the young man.&amp;#160; But Mitt&#8217;s last month as a Stanford student was May 1966.&amp;#160; Why?</p> \n\n<p>Although the Selective Service Exam radically reduced the chances of college men, especially those with the test-taking skills of most Stanford students, to be conscripted into the Vietnam War, it was no guarantee of long-lasting deferment.&amp;#160; There were other, surer, escapes from the Vietnam nightmare.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; One of the very best was the ministry.&amp;#160; In 1966, young men flooded into divinity schools, embarking on careers to be ministers, priests, and rabbis.&amp;#160; The Mormons had an even better deal than most religions, because The Church of Latter-Day Saints required each and every one of its young men to become, for at least two years, a &#8220;minister of religion.&#8221;&amp;#160; &amp;#160;Thus all Mormon young men could claim deferments as ministers.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; When the inequity of this arrangement became too blatant, the Selective Service entered into an agreement with the LDS that required the church to specify just one &#8220;minister&#8221; for each geographical district.&amp;#160; Since there were relatively few Mormons in Michigan, and Governor George Romney had considerable influence in the church, Mitt quickly received an official appointment as a Mormon &#8220;minister of religion,&#8221; consecrated by a draft deferment from the Selective Service. &amp;#160;So instead of returning to Stanford, Mitt went off to become a Mormon missionary in France, where he would spend the next two and a half years&#8212;while Vietnam became a slaughterhouse for the Vietnamese and many Americans drafted to slaughter them.</p> \n\n<p>So who says that Mitt Romney is inconsistent?&amp;#160; After all, what may have been his first recorded public political act was supporting the draft for ordinary Americans, forcing them to participate in a war waged in the interest of his own class.</p> \n\n<p>H.

(If you're unfamiliar with why this segment is so important to Intel and its investors, read <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/10/13/intel-corporations-data-center-business-3-things-i.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">this Opens a New Window.</a>.)</p> \n\n<p>During the first half of the year, Intel's data center business delivered disappointing revenue growth relative to its long-term 15% compounded annual growth rate guidance and even its full-year guidance of low-double-digit percentage growth -- 9% in the first quarter and just 5% in the second quarter.</p> \n\n<p>Despite those lackluster results in the first half of 2016, Intel management insisted that it could still hit its double-digit growth target for the year as a result of a significant reacceleration during the second half of the year. Intel's data center group achieved just 10% year-over-year growth in the third quarter and, unsurprisingly, guided down full-year expectations to just \"high-single-digit growth.\"</p> \n\n<p>Although the better-than-expected results in the company's personal computer chip business helped to bolster the quarterly results -- even the \"worse than expected\" fourth-quarter guidance still represents a healthy number -- investors are very sensitive to the performance of the company's data center group.</p> \n\n<p>Remember, Intel and many investors have basically written off hopes of ever seeing its PC business as a \"growth\" business again -- it's a large cash cow that's going to milked for every last dollar of operating profit that it can reasonably produce.</p> \n\n<p>The data center group, on the other hand, represents the company's best hope over the long term at sustainable growth, since the markets it serves are generally growing. If this shows signs of faltering, then Intel's growth prospects may appear dimmer -- leading to a lower share price.</p> \n\n<p>Although the headline results might seem bad, things look better when one takes a look under the covers. The bulk of Intel's data center group revenue comes from the sale of processors, and according to the company's 2015 investor meeting, those processor sales can be broken down into three major categories:</p> \n\n<p>Intel's prior forecast called for each of these segments to represent roughly a third of the processor revenue that its data center group generates in 2016.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Intel.</p> \n\n<p>According to Intel, although the second two categories performed well -- and they're generally viewed as the healthy and growing sub-segments of Intel's data center business -- the enterprise server portion of its business came in worse than expected. Intel says it was looking for enterprise-related revenue to be roughly flat, but it wound up declining about 3% in the quarter.</p> \n\n<p>The good news here is that the sub-segments that have historically been growing are still growing, so it's not as though these results cast doubt over the long-term trends that this business is expected to benefit from. It just so happens that one generally problematic and disappointing sub-segment was a little more problematic and disappointing than is usually the case.</p> \n\n<p>So although the data center results were disappointing, they're hardly cause to freak out over. If you liked Intel's long-term prospects before the earnings report, then this one \"miss\" really shouldn't change that fundamental view.</p> \n\n<p>A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The experience is nothing short of heartbreaking. &amp;#160;We&#8217;ve witnessed <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">baby animals cower at the edge of the trailer, terrified of what&#8217;s next</a>. &amp;#160;We&#8217;ve witnessed <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">a baby goat &#8211; immobilized by fear, injury or both &#8211; physically carried to slaughter</a>. &amp;#160;And we&#8217;ve witnessed one animal after the next look to us with pleading eyes, desperate for any kind of comfort.

This would be a small step to say the sort of pain that baby goat went through is unacceptable in the City of Chicago.

After one not-so-successful attempt at cajoling publishers to post their news stories directly to the social network, the company hasreportedly tweaked its offering enough to appease bigger publishers testing out the updated Instant Articles platform. And now it has plans to extend its reach into news much further, bringing aboard other online news publishers and bloggers starting this spring, when it will open Instant Articles to all publishers.</p> \n\n<p>The latest move has the chance to help Facebook in two ways:</p> \n\n<p>Facebook has been trying to get its Instant Articles platform off the ground since last May. Its initial rollout with some publishers last year, however, didn't go over very well. Those who tested out the platform found that it wasn't delivering the kind of ad revenue that would make it advantageous for them to publish articles directly to the social network rather than publish to their own sites and use social to guide readers to the content.</p> \n\n<p>Round 2 has gone better Facebook took a step back later last year and made changes in hopes of easing some of the news publishers' concerns. It now offers the publishers 70% of the revenue generated on the Facebook-procured ads on their Instant Articles and 100% of the revenue of any ads they procure themselves.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Image source: instantarticles.fb.com.</p> \n\n<p>It also loosened up restrictions on how many ads the publishers could place on each article page. Facebook, understandably worried about diminishing its users' experience, had initially set ad limits that publishers testing the pages found too restrictive to make the type of money necessary to consider staying on board.</p> \n\n<p>Those changes were apparently enough to satisfy some very popular publishers. Several <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-instant-articles-advertising-fixes-win-over-publishers-1455218551\" type=\"external\">spoke recently to The Wall Street Journal Opens a New Window.</a>, including Business Insider, Vox, and Mic, all major players in online news with varied audiences. Each had good things to say about their ability to generate revenue through the platform, and through the use of the ads procured through the Facebook Audience Network.</p> \n\n<p>Bringing Instant Articles to smaller publishersSoon after that WSJ report, Facebook announced plans to extend Instant Articles to all Web publishers. The company is no doubt comfortable with what it heard back after the tweaks and is ready for a major expansion to the platform, which is expected to come sometime after the F8 Facebook Developer Conference in April.</p> \n\n<p>The move to post content through Instant Articles will not be not an easy one for many news publishers. It has the potential to offer a healthy source of digital ad revenue, which can be frustratingly elusive for companies that don't deal in the type of big data that Facebook and Alphabet do. It also offers the potential of a much greater reach, with the ability to share content with friends an important component in delivery.</p> \n\n<p>But publishers have to reckon with a downside, too. Publishing directly to Facebook's platform has the potential to further commoditize the news content they deal in, siphoning off even more of their brands' strength over time.</p> \n\n<p>On top of that, it creates the potential for the publications to become increasingly more reliant on Facebook for their digital traffic -- and digital ad revenue. That's not a problem as long as the rules are working in their favor, but if Facebook were to change these rules, the publishers could be in a much weaker bargaining position than they were when they demanded better terms from Facebook last year.</p> \n\n<p>Maybe not a \"win-win,\" but it could be mutually beneficialBut it's not as if they were in a strong position to start with, either. Generating digital ad revenue has been difficult for many publishers. If Facebook's platform offers them the ability to generate as much or more revenue than they can from the same story on their own site, we should expect them to continue publishing directly to Facebook.</p> \n\n<p>For that reason, it made good sense for Facebook to have sweetened the pot enough to get them to stick around. While it's sharing a bigger portion of its ad revenue now, the long-term gains would seem to go to the social network.</p> \n\n<p>The article <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/09/good-news-in-facebooks-drive-to-win-over-publisher.aspx\" type=\"external\">Good News in Facebook's Drive to Win Over Publishers Opens a New Window.</a> originally appeared on Fool.com.</p> \n\n<p>Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. <a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/jekoslosky/info.aspx?source=eptfxblnk0000004\" type=\"external\">John-Erik Koslosky Opens a New Window.</a> owns shares of GOOGL. and FB.

Frequently, these calls for cooperation are escape routes for those who prefer to transcend real and important political and policy divides and who yearn to position themselves above the critical but down-and-dirty squabbles that shape this country&#8217;s future. Yet there are times when the pursuit of a common purpose uniting Democrats and Republicans is necessary to advance important policy aims and to demonstrate to the citizenry that the nation&#8217;s capital can function and serve the public interest. And in an era of increasing political rancor, Washington&#8217;s ability to rise to this task is now diminished with the primary defeat of Sen. Dick Lugar, an Indiana Republican.</p> \n\n<p>Lugar was beaten on Tuesday by Richard Mourdock, the tea-party-favored state treasurer. This was not unexpected. Lugar, a <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Richard_Lugar.htm\" type=\"external\">moderate</a> GOPer who had served in the Senate since 1977, was ripe for the defenestration. Tea partiers in recent years had eviscerated other targeted-from-the-right Republican senators, including Bob Bennett of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. (Murkowski was able to retain her seat via an unconventional <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/11/17/murkowski-wins-election-write-candidate-ap-projects/\" type=\"external\">write-in campaign</a>.) And Lugar, unlike John McCain (who successfully beat back this sort of challenge in 2010), did little to protect his right flank in the past two years.</p> \n\n<p>Lugar&#8217;s defeat will be cited by the hand-wringing DC pooh-bahs as another sign of hopelessness. But the loss of Lugar&#8212;as opposed to, say, the loss of Bennett&#8212;will have true policy ramifications, for this Hoosier frequently endeavored to forge bipartisan coalitions to advance national security priorities.</p> \n\n<p>Most notably, as I recounted in my new book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Showdown-Inside-Fought-Against-Boehner/dp/0062107992\" type=\"external\">Showdown: The Inside Story of How Obama Fought Back Against Boehner, Cantor, and the Tea Party</a>, Lugar worked&#8212;that is, conspired with&#8212;the Obama White House to win ratification of the New START treaty reducing the number of US and Russian nuclear weapons. With leading Senate Republicans opposed to the treaty&#8212;mainly, it seemed, because Obama had negotiated it&#8212;Lugar, the senior Republican on the Senate foreign relations committee, collaborated with Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), the chair of that committee, and Vice President Joe Biden to devise a strategy to circumvent his party&#8217;s opposition. This entailed undercutting McCain, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and the GOP&#8217;s chief voice on arms control, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.).</p> \n\n<p>The yearlong effort to achieve ratification&#8212;which was approved on a bipartisan vote as the lame-duck session of 2010 was coming to a close&#8212;was a deftly mounted effort. At one point, Kerry, though he controlled the committee, had Lugar introduce the ratification resolution in order to win over a couple of Republican senators so the White House could claim the treaty had bipartisan backing. And Kerry even complained publicly about Lugar&#8217;s resolution to make it easier for Lugar to sell it to his GOP comrades. It is hard to envision a Democratic White House cooperating as closely with another Republican senator on such a significant matter.</p> \n\n<p>Lugar&#8212;who years earlier had worked in the Senate with Obama to pass <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2008/08/25/28084/rove-obama-lugar/\" type=\"external\">legislation</a> to detect and secure loose nukes overseas&#8212;was not a pushover for Obama. Prior to Obama&#8217;s launching of multilateral strikes on Libya, he told the president he would <a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/morning-joe/42207545\" type=\"external\">not support this action</a>. He also publicly raised questions about US involvement in Afghanistan, <a href=\"http://lugar.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=332665\" type=\"external\">noting</a> in 2011, &#8220;It is exceedingly difficult to conclude that our vast expenditures in Afghanistan represent a rational allocation of our military and financial assets.&#8221; But he was the rare Republican lawmaker who preferred to collaborate than clash with the president.</p> \n\n<p>Lugar was an independent&#8212;and often reasonable&#8212;GOP voice on foreign policy, surviving for decades within a party that often put a premium on extreme and harsh positions. A decade ago, he joined with Joe Biden, then a senator, and fellow Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) to try to slow President George W. Bush&#8217;s rush to war in Iraq. In response to Bush&#8217;s request for legislation authorizing him to attack Iraq at a time of his own choosing, Lugar, Biden, and Hagel pushed an <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=iznyGV9qkjoC&amp;amp;pg=PA127&amp;amp;lpg=PA127&amp;amp;dq=Biden-Lugar-Hagel+bush+war&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=zgWHqPMEIS&amp;amp;sig=lHxGDcXhBg6HC563VpNPUz6WOAg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=4qSpT72BBaaPigLBupHJCw&amp;amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Biden-Lugar-Hagel%20bush%20war&amp;amp;f=false\" type=\"external\">alternative</a> that would permit Bush to initiate a war only for the purpose of destroying Iraq&#8217;s WMD and only after seeking United Nations approval. Absent a UN green light, Bush would have to come back to Congress and demonstrate that the Iraqi weapons threat was so &#8220;grave&#8221; that only military action could eliminate it. (The Biden-Lugar-Hagel effort ended up being derailed by none other than Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, who cut a deal with the Bush White House and essentially accepted the resolution Bush was demanding.)</p> \n\n<p>Lugar was a charisma-challenged Republican. His attempt at <a href=\"http://www.4president.us/websites/1996/lugar1996website.htm\" type=\"external\">a presidential campaign</a> in the 1996 cycle was ludicrous. (During his announcement, he stood alone on a rather big stage and looked quite small.) But he was a policy-minded legislator who did the heavy-lifting on issues far from the spotlight and who was not reluctant to put aside partisanship when policy progress was possible. As Washington&#8217;s centrism fanciers predictably grieve the electoral demise of another member of that endangered breed, the Republican moderate, this is indeed a genuine loss for those who care about arms control, nuclear nonproliferation, and foreign-policy discussions that are serious and deep, not silly and opportunistic.</p> \n\n<p>UPDATE: On Tuesday night, Obama released this statement: &#8220;As a friend and former colleague, I want to express my deep appreciation for Dick Lugar&#8217;s distinguished service in the United States Senate. While Dick and I didn&#8217;t always agree on everything, I found during my time in the Senate that he was often willing to reach across the aisle and get things done. My administration&#8217;s efforts to secure the world&#8217;s most dangerous weapons has been based on the work that Senator Lugar began, as well as the bipartisan cooperation we forged during my first overseas trip as Senator to Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Why Washington Needs Dick Lugar", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2012/05/why-washington-needs-dick-lugar/", "published_at": "2012-05-09", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>&amp;#160; &amp;#160; Hillary Clinton.

Mike Lee of Utah designed to drive down premiums.</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Short said any proposed legislation will retain a stipulation that tax credits cannot be used for abortion funding and will include a one-year ban on federal funding for Planned Parenthood.</p> \n\n<p>Despite long odds, some <a href=\"/topics/senate/\" type=\"external\">Senate</a> Republicans said the <a href=\"/topics/white-house/\" type=\"external\">White House</a> summit gave the repeal-and-replace effort new life.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Sometimes when you are facing defeat and nobody wants to accept it, that prompts people to rethink positions, open up their minds,&#8221; said Sen. Ron Johnson, Wisconsin Republican. &#8220;People talk, another accommodation here or there &#8212; we want to get a result, we all want to fix this problem. We&#8217;re just not giving up.

The tech-heavy exchange was full of companies that tended to reinvest their profits into growth projects rather than returning capital to shareholders. But in recent years, more Nasdaq-listed companies have are looking at dividends as a critical part of their total return success.</p> \n\n<p>Below, we examine the 10 top-yielding dividend stocks in the Nasdaq 100 today, with an eye toward identifying whether any of them give you the combination of income and growth prospects that make them ideal candidates for your portfolio.</p> \n\n<p>Here are the 10 highest-yielding stocks among the Nasdaq 100 as of Aug. 18:</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Data source: Yahoo! Finance.</p> \n\n<p>The most obvious thing about this chart is the huge lead that Seagate Technology has over its Nasdaq 100 brethren. The maker of hard-disk drives and other data storage products has long been on many investors' danger lists in terms of expectations for a dividend cut in the future, especially because the company has been under considerable pressure as the mobile revolution reduces the importance of PCs, with their traditional reliance on hard drives for storage. In addition, Seagate's free cash flow has been less than its dividend payments in the first two quarters of 2016.</p> \n\n<p>Ordinarily, such a high yield would indeed be a danger sign. However, Seagate has actually seen its yield drop from double-digit percentages earlier this year as the stock recovered somewhat from lows below $19 a share, and optimism about the company's prospects are the primary cause. <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/08/05/how-seagate-technology-plc-gained-31-in-july.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Investors were pleased by Seagate's recent restructuring announcements Opens a New Window.</a>, and even though the company expects to reduce production of hard drives, it is looking at focusing more on high-end enterprise applications, which carry higher margins. In addition, efforts to expand its exposure to flash memory and solid-state drives could represent growth opportunities for Seagate as well. Rival Western Digital has also seen some positive movement in its share price, and although its yield also remains high, rays of hope have emerged for the data storage industry.</p> \n\n<p>Another trend you can see in this list of stocks is that it includes many former high-flyers that have come upon tough times. In the semiconductor industry, for instance, Qualcomm and Intel are both going through the pains of adapting to changing conditions in the PC and mobile chip businesses. Cisco has seen similar changes afflict its networking hardware unit. Yet an recently improving tech sector has lifted those stocks and sent their yields lower compared to where they were early in 2016.</p> \n\n<p>Among the stocks above, however, there are some interesting growth candidates. <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/06/corporate-profits-in-britain-could-soar-and-brexit.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Vodafone has struggled due to competitive pressure Opens a New Window.</a> in the European wireless telecom market, but the decline in the British pound could bolster its profits due to favorable foreign-exchange impacts and help send the stock higher. Moreover, expansion efforts in emerging markets in Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region could also add to growth. Even though Vodafone no longer has its exposure to the U.S. market after selling its minority stake in Verizon Wireless, the British telecom arguably has even better prospects because of the potential in many underserved emerging markets.</p> \n\n<p>At the same time, Paychex has exposure to the strong U.S. economy. By offering payroll services to employers, especially small and mid-sized businesses, Paychex keeps its finger on the pulse of American employment trends. As job growth has increased and the economy has recovered from the financial crisis, Paychex has been able to sustaining its own growth. With the U.S. still outpacing its peers overseas economically, Paychex offers not only an attractive yield but also plenty of possibilities for rising share prices.</p> \n\n<p>For dividend investors looking at the Nasdaq as a source of stock ideas, the index's traditional aversion to dividends has almost entirely disappeared. By focusing on the stocks with the best growth prospects, however, you'll ensure that you not only get paid while you wait for companies to reach their full potential but also enjoy share-price appreciation when they succeed in their growth goals. Seagate offers that mix for those who are willing to assume the execution risk of the storage-device maker's turnaround efforts, and both Vodafone and Paychex also have opportunities to expand their respective businesses to give dividend investors even more of what they want in the months and years ahead.</p> \n\n<p>A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The viceroy appointed by George W. Bush, Paul Bremer, had no legal charter from the US Congress and represented no one, having never been elected to anything. He wrote dozens of laws for the Iraqis by fiat. They are still technically the law of the land in Iraq. He used Iraq&#8217;s oil revenue, billions of dollars worth, to run his interim government, even though no Iraqi voted to give it to him for that purpose. In subsequent years the US intervened heavy-handedly in Iraqi political affairs and still does so today. Few complaints of the Founding Fathers against Britain could not be lodged against the United States by Iraq.</p> \n\n<p>All through spring of 2009, US officers in Iraq heavily lobbied the new president, Barack Obama, not to honor the Status of Forces Agreement that George W. Bush had negotiated with the Iraqi parliament during his last months in office. It called for troop reductions. The officers opposed them. It called for US forces to cease actively patrolling major Iraqi cities on June 30, 2009. the officers said that step was foolhardy, and would make it impossible to keep up their collection of intelligence on urban guerrillas. It called for rapid US troop reductions. The officers argued that Iraq would fall back into instability.</p> \n\n<p>Obama stuck to his guns, and the US soldiers stopped patrolling the cities independently on June 30, 2009. In July of that year, the number of attacks by guerrillas and the number of civilians killed both fell by one third. It appears that the patrols were causing violence, not stopping it, since the guerrillas attacked the patrols and ended up killing civilians.</p> \n\n<p>The troop withdrawal also proceeded apace throughout the past year. Although Iraq remains in a low-intensity civil war, the monthly death toll of civilians and security forces averages 300-400 now, compared to 2500 a month in summer of 2006. At the height of the troop escalation or surge there were around 170,000 US troops in Iraq. Today there are about 88,000 and the number is rapidly falling.</p> \n\n<p>Everything the naysayers in the Pentagon alleged about the effect of implementing the SOFA was wrong.</p> \n\n<p>Now unnamed sources in Iraq <a href=\"http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/fighting-but-not-calling-it-combat/\" type=\"external\">are leaking again to the New York Times</a>. They want to insist that the timetable for troop withdrawal in the SOFA is unrealistic. They cannot imagine that US troops will really leave by the end of 2011. They are sure that the SOFA will be renegotiated by the new Iraqi government whenever it is finally formed.</p> \n\n<p>While the SOFA could be tinkered with, there are powerful forces working against that outcome. The Sadrists, fundamentalist Shiites who follow cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, may well be kingmakers of the new government, and they are dead set against any change to the SOFA timetables. The Sadrists are highly politically networked and their relative success in the March 7 parliamentary elections attests to their political strength even today. They could prove spoilers of any attempt by the US to drag its feet on withdrawal, since they can put thousands of protesters and hundreds of guerrillas in the street.</p> \n\n<p>Nor is the threat only of renewed political unrest among Sadrists if the US stays in force. Al-Hayat reported on May 24, &#8220;The local government in Basra announced yesterday its commitment to the security agreement signed by Iraq and the United States for scheduling the US forces&#8217; withdrawal. The announcement came in reply to statements by Al-Sadr Trend in the governorate about preparing its armed wing &#8220;Al-Mahdi Army&#8221; to resume the resistance activity against the remaining forces in the governorate and to wait for orders to do this from Trend Leader Muqtada al-Sadr.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It is true that the 50,000 or so troops that will be left in Iraq as of September may not all be &#8216;non-combat&#8217; units, since there will be some rebranding. And it is true that Iraq will need the US air force for years to come, for logistics purposes. But to say that the timetable will be tinkered with at the request of the Iraqi parliament in any major way is wishful thinking.</p> \n\n<p>The US commanders were expecting to be asked by the Iraqi officers to go on joint patrols in the major cities. They got few invitations, even though they had trained many of the Iraqi officers who now gave them the cold shoulder. The new Iraqi military is perfectly capable of patrolling on its own now in cities such as Baghdad, and of facing down any ordinary threat from militias. The US is not needed for routine security patrols. While the Iraqi troops have not been able to establish order in Mosul or in Diyala Province, the prospect of the dwindling number of US troops doing so is slim to none. Iraq is just going to be a little unstable for a few years, and even if US troops stayed in numbers past the deadlines, it is highly unlikely that they could miraculously lend the place stability. Bush knocked Iraq off balance, and it will likely remain off balance for a good long time. Bush was not authorized by the Iraqi people to destroy the country. He was acting more like his namesake, King George III, than like a president who won an election.</p> \n\n<p>Moreover, as the US military has increasingly focused on Afghanistan, many will realize that they just don&#8217;t have the resources to continue in Iraq.</p> \n\n<p>Iraqi factions are finding it hard to form a government in the wake of the March 7 parliamentary elections. But they have a perfectly good interim government, that of incumbent Nuri al-Maliki, in the meantime. And it took Lebanon 5 months to form a government recently. The Lebanon case is instructive because the national unity government that came out of months of wrangling is fairly representative and seems to have forestalled further trouble of the sort we saw in May 2008. Vice President <a href=\"\" type=\"external\">Biden may or may not succeed in helping the factions make progress during his visit to Baghdad this weekend</a>, but contrary to what some American politicians say, there is no reason the process of government-formation cannot be protracted. Consensus is better in Iraqi politics than up-and-down-votes that cause some faction to lose and to lose face.</p> \n\n<p>For the pragmatic reason that the US cannot afford Iraq, and because it is the right thing to do, the Obama administration should withdraw in a systematic and deliberate manner from Iraq. We owe its people their independence. It is what we used, at least, to stand for.</p>", "title": "On Fourth of July, Let Iraq Go", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://juancole.com/2010/07/on-fourth-of-july-let-iraq-go.html", "published_at": "2010-07-04", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>On Tuesday, President Obama held a ceremony at the White House to announce his use of executive authority to expand the <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/content/ca/en/prog/blm_special_areas/nm/ccnm.html\" type=\"external\">California Coastal National Monument</a> (CCNM) to include the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands on the Mendocino Coast. This is the first land-based addition to the CCNM and permanently protects more than 1,660 acres of beach, bluffs, and the Garcia River estuary. The area is home to rare and endangered species such as coho salmon, steelhead, the Point Arena mountain beaver, and the Behren&#8217;s silverspot butterfly.

For comparison, President Clinton created 19 new monuments and enlarged three others, while President George W. Bush used his power under the Antiquities Act just 5 times.</p> \n\n<p>While Obama has been criticized in the past for his reluctance to declare monuments, there appears to be new momentum in the administration to conserve. Former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/03/25/president-obama-designates-five-new-national-monuments\" type=\"external\">announced five designations</a> before leaving office last year, and in November, his successor Sally Jewell delivered a major agenda-setting speech on conservation that challenged Congress to pass the many backlogged conservation bills that are pending, saying that &#8220;President Obama is ready and willing to step up where Congress falls short.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Obama confirmed this in his state of the Union speech, saying&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;&#8220;I&#8217;ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Even Congress seems to be hearing the message. Although the previous 112th Congress became somewhat notorious as the first in decades not to protect a single new acre of public lands, last Tuesday, Congress passed a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/congress-passes-bill-to-protect-michigans-sleeping-bear-dunes-as-wilderness-area/2014/03/04/89c0dc34-a3ee-11e3-a5fa-55f0c77bf39c_story.html\" type=\"external\">bill to set aside</a> more than 30,000 acres of wilderness at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in Michigan.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The President&#8217;s decision to protect this stunning section of California&#8217;s coastline shows his commitment to helping communities protect the lands and waters they love,&#8221; said Matt Lee-Ashley, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. &#8220;It also sends a clear signal to Congress that&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;as the President has already made clear&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;he is not going to continue to wait while dozens of parks and wilderness bills remain stalled, year after year.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The President is right to use his authority to ensure that America&#8217;s most special places are protected for everyone to experience and enjoy.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Despite the new momentum to conserve, Obama still has a long way to go to establish balance between conservation and fossil fuel development on federal lands. From the beginning of Obama&#8217;s first term through 2013, 7.3 million acres of public lands were leased to oil and gas companies, while just 2.9 million acres were permanently protected.</p> \n\n<p>The newly-designated area has long been considered for special protection. In July, the House <a href=\"http://huffman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/huffman-introduces-first-bill-as-us-congressman\" type=\"external\">unanimously approved</a> Rep. Jared Huffman&#8217;s (D-CA) proposal to add the area to the California Coastal National Monument, but subsequently the bill was left to languish in the Senate.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I am thrilled that President Obama has preserved these pristine and breathtaking coastal lands,&#8221; said Congressman Huffman. &#8220;Thousands of new visitors each year will flock to see this gateway to the Coastal National Monument. As they enjoy some of the best ocean views in Northern California, they will also provide a significant boost to the local tourism industry, already Mendocino County&#8217;s biggest employer. I thank President Obama for bringing this land into permanent protection as a National Monument.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;This is great news for small businesses, because entrepreneurs know protecting our natural assets is one way we can enhance the financial success of small businesses and local economies.&#8221; said John Arensmeyer, Founder and CEO of Small Business Majority. &#8220;Small business owners in the West strongly believe the designation of additional national parks and monuments enhances local jobs and the economy.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks in New Mexico, the Boulder-White Clouds in Idaho and the Greater Canyonlands in Utah are on the top of conservationists&#8217; wish lists for future monument designation.</p> \n\n<p>In response to the president&#8217;s action Rep. Rob Bishop released the following statement. &#8220;The legislation was held up in the Senate so the president could usurp the congressional process,&#8221; said Bishop. &#8220;In other words, the House was punked by the president.

In 2014, simply tweeting and posting Facebook updates isn&#8217;t enough.</p> \n\n<p>Snapchat: What was once an app for sending silly selfies, Snapchat can&#8217;t be ignored when it comes to social media marketing.&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/snapchat-for-business/\" type=\"external\">Businesses can use Snapchat Opens a New Window.</a>&amp;#160;to send deals to customers to help get them in the door. Since the message disappears after a number of seconds, send Snaps to customers with a &#8220;surprise&#8221; discount deal that can only be activated in the store.</p> \n\n<p>More AllBusiness.com:</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.allbusiness.com/top-25-home-based-businesses/16659292-1.html\" type=\"external\">The Top 25 Home-Based Business Ideas Opens a New Window.</a> <a href=\"http://experts.allbusiness.com/slideshows/10-websites-where-you-should-have-your-company-profile-listed/\" type=\"external\">10 Websites Where You Should Have Your Company Profile Listed Opens a New Window.</a> <a href=\"http://experts.allbusiness.com/25-frequently-asked-questions-on-starting-a-business/8225/\" type=\"external\">25 Frequently Asked Questions on Starting a Business Opens a New Window.</a> <a href=\"http://experts.allbusiness.com/50-inspirational-quotes-for-entrepreneurs-startups/\" type=\"external\">50 Inspirational Quotes for Entrepreneurs and Start-Ups Opens a New Window.</a></p> \n\n<p>Twitter Ads: Chances are your business is already on Twitter engaging customers in some aspect, so adding a Twitter ads campaign can only help drive that engagement up and gain additional followers and sales. Twitter Ads allows extremely hyper-targeted ads, which can lead to a fantastic ROI.</p> \n\n<p>Local Networks: Many businesses aren&#8217;t taking advantage of <a href=\"http://societyflorence.com/circle-the-local-network-is-this-new-app-worth-the-time/\" type=\"external\">&amp;#160;local networks such as Circle Opens a New Window.</a>&amp;#160;to facilitate discussion and gain more customers. While this might not be applicable to a national brand, individual chains can participate in local networks to become more authoritative and act as a go-to resource for local information. Other local networks such as Meetey are an under-utilized tool that can be of big value.</p> \n\n<p>2. Crowdsource a Custom Wiki</p> \n\n<p>Crowdsourcing was all the rage in 2013, and in 2014 one can reasonably expect it to be even more relevant when it comes to social networks. Successfully utilizing crowdsourcing can be difficult because it requires an already high level of engagement, but if done correctly it can pay dividends for both businesses and customers alike. Crowdsourcing a custom wiki is essentially asking your past customers to develop content for you to help other customers. It could be anything from testimonials to FAQs to common issues; whatever it is, the content is coming from the customers, meaning it&#8217;s honest. It will also help you as a business get valuable feedback in order to improve and offer better services.</p> \n\n<p>3. Engage Your 21st&amp;#160;Century Coupon&amp;#160;Young Professionals</p> \n\n<p>One of the main demographic users for social networks, they would never clip a coupon out of a magazine and bring it to your establishment. Businesses are using social media to create customized, unique &#8220;eDeals&#8221; to engage and draw in customers. Whether it&#8217;s&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://storify.com/miguelsalcido/is-apple-s-ibeacon-the-wave-of-the-future/\" type=\"external\">harnessing the power of the iBeacon Opens a New Window.</a>&amp;#160;to create GPS targeted deals or offering dedicated customer service agents via Twitter to respond to issues and offer customer retention deals, the 21st&amp;#160;century coupon is a game changer. Each social network offers a somewhat different opportunity relating to how a business could offer a coupon. For example, &#8220;checking-in&#8221; on Facebook or FourSquare could unlock a deal, or tweeting that you&#8217;re at a current location could do the same. The more creative a business is with its social coupons, the higher the likelihood of engagement.</p> \n\n<p>Miguel Salcido is a veteran search marketing executive with a focus on SEO and link building.

While the company had some good news, investors focused more on what the company did not say.</p> \n\n<p>SM Energy actually got the year started off on the right foot, announcing in early January that it had sold its non-operated Eagle Ford shale assets to a unit of private equity firm KKR (NYSE: KKR) for $800 million. That sale will give SM Energy additional flexibility to aggressively grow its Midland Basin assets over the next few years.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Getty Images.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Analysts loved the deal, with both Bank of America/Merrill and Baird releasing bullish commentary shortly after its announcement. BofA, for example, initiated the stock at Buy with a $52 price target citing the company's notable transition after selling $2 billion of assets since 2013 to focus on the Midland Basin. Meanwhile, Baird said the stock was underappreciated and reiterated its buy rating and $49 price target. The analyst thought that the company should benefit from rising oil prices due to its focus on the low-cost Midland Basin.</p> \n\n<p>About a week later SM Energy announced that it had put the rest of its Bakken shale assets up for sale by launching a formal bid process for its Divide County assets. The company hopes to close a transaction by mid-year. That announcement follows an earlier divestiture of Bakken assets to Oasis Petroleum (NYSE: OAS). SM Energy used the proceeds from the Oasis Petroleum transaction to help finance an acquisition in the Midland Basin.</p> \n\n<p>Toward the end of the month, SM Energy received another vote of confidence from analysts after KeyBanc said investors should buy shares before its month-end conference call. The analyst thought that the call would prove to be a catalyst for the stock because it would feature an update on its Midland Basin well results. Unfortunately, that call did not turn out to be a catalyst.

That suggests production growth could come in below what investors were hoping.</p> \n\n<p>SM Energy is still in the early stages of a transition from a diversified shale producer to a company entirely focused on the red-hot Midland Basin. This development is taking longer than investors had hoped. However, that is because SM Energy wants to make sure it gets things right by fully optimizing its acreage in the Midland.

They were shipping in arms under the cover of oil tools.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The BP executive was explaining to me how the CIA, MI6 and British Petroleum engineered a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat, overthrowing a nation&#8217;s elected president who was &#8220;not favorable to BP.&#8221; The corporation&#8217;s former vice president, Leslie Abrahams, is pictured above, holding an AK-47 in front of BP&#8217;s offices in Baku, Azerbaijan. Like most of the other BP executives I spoke with, he proudly added that although he was working for BP, he was also an operative for MI6, British intelligence.</p> \n\n<p>This conversation, which took place in 2010, was far from the weirdest I had in my four-continent investigation of the real story of the Deepwater Horizon.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The BP oil rig blew out on April 20 of that year, four years ago this Sunday.</p> \n\n<p>Last month, the Obama administration officially OK&#8217;d BP&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/20/bp-gulf-of-mexico-leases_n_4996314.html\" type=\"external\">right to resume</a> drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. A few days after lifting the ban, just to assure the company that all is forgiven, the U.S. Department of the Interior gave BP a new contract to drill in the Gulf of Mexico &#8212; right next to where the Deepwater Horizon went down. At the same time, the forgive-and-forget U.S. Justice Department has put the trial of David Rainey, the only BP big shot charged with a felony crime in the disaster, on indefinite hold.</p> \n\n<p>The Deepwater Horizon blowout incinerated 11 men on the rig and poisoned 600 miles of Gulf coastline. What political fairy dust does BP keep in its pocket to receive virtual immunity from the consequences?</p> \n\n<p>To understand what really happened in the Gulf of Mexico, and how BP became a corporate creature beyond the reach of the law, British television network Channel 4 sent me on an investigation through a labyrinthine fun house of bribery, lap dancing, beatings, WikiLeaks, a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat, arrests and oil-state terror.</p> \n\n<p>I found the cause of the tragedy of the Deepwater Horizon 7,000 miles from the Gulf in the ancient city of Baku, the Central Asian caravan stop on the Silk Road.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>For the interview with agent Abrahams and the full story of the Deepwater Horizon, see, &#8220;Vultures and Vote Rustlers,&#8221; the documentary that will be available as a <a href=\"http://www.gregpalast.com/vulturesandvoterustlersfreedownload/\" type=\"external\">download without charge</a> until April 21 courtesy of the not-for-profit Palast Investigative Fund.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The literal source of Soviet power until 1991, Baku has been exporting petroleum for 3,000 years. As the Soviet Union shattered into pieces that year, BP set its sights on the city. It is now the capital of the new nation of Azerbaijan, which sits atop the biggest untapped oil field in the world, right beneath the Caspian Sea.</p> \n\n<p>A coup for BP</p> \n\n<p>In 1992, then-BP Chairman Lord Browne flew into Baku as soon as the young state elected its first president, Abulfaz Elchibey. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher joined him via the &#8220;Iron Lady,&#8221; a plane the corporation outfitted especially for her. At a state dinner, Browne handed Abrahams, a BP vice president at the time, a briefcase and showed him the contents: a check for $30 million. Browne then gave the check to the president of Azerbaijan.</p> \n\n<p>Still, the new president remained &#8220;not favorable&#8221; to BP&#8217;s demand for control of the Caspian oil, so MI6, the CIA and the corporation went into action. The spy agencies armed and empowered former Soviet KGB chief Heydar Aliyev, who in 1993 overthrew Azerbaijan&#8217;s elected government. Once he became dictator, Aliyev named himself president for life and within four months signed a no-bid deal to give the reserves to BP.</p> \n\n<p>BP and MI6 man Abrahams was instructed, he told me, to &#8220;smooth the way&#8221; for the deal by taking Azeri officials to London in Browne&#8217;s jet for weekends of lap dancing and other entertainment. By Abrahams&#8217; own estimation, he paid over $3 million in additional cash bribes to make certain BP would have no trouble.</p> \n\n<p>I should note that Abrahams broke no law: Bribery by a British subject was legal then. BP executives did not deny the payoffs when I questioned them directly, and MI6 officers proudly confirmed the coup&#8217;s purpose of locking in the offshore deal for BP.</p> \n\n<p>Quick-dry, quick-kill cement</p> \n\n<p>What does this have to do with the blowout of the Deepwater Horizon?</p> \n\n<p>This: It is now well established that the disaster occurred when the cement used to cap the well failed, allowing explosive methane gas to fill the rig and transform it into a sinking fireball.</p> \n\n<p>But this was not BP&#8217;s first cement failure and explosion. Just 17 months earlier, BP&#8217;s Caspian Sea Transocean rig had suffered exactly the same fate.</p> \n\n<p>The cause of the two blowouts was identical. In the Caspian as in the Gulf, BP laced its cement with nitrogen gas. The nitrogen bubbles sped up the drying of the mixture, saving BP half a million dollars a day on rig rental charges. But in offshore high-pressure zones, nitrogen-spiked cement can fail. And it did. Twice.Question: Why in the world was BP allowed to use this insanely dangerous &#8220;quick-dry&#8221; cement just after a failure in the Caspian? Answer: A cover-up &#8212; via threats, beatings, arrests, bribery, perjury and the complicity of the U.S. State Department.</p> \n\n<p>I learned of the prior blowout only because of a coded message from the Caspian Sea received from one very nervous eyewitness. To get the evidence, I flew to Baku and headed across the road-less desert to find more witnesses.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Greg Palast and crew under arrest in Azerbaijan. Photo by Palast Investigative Fund</p> \n\n<p>But we had been ratted out. My crew was placed under arrest by Azerbaijan&#8217;s secret police. Although officers demanded our film, I was allowed to keep my pen, which was actually a hidden camera. (I&#8217;ve learned a few things from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pArBEnKcoMw\" type=\"external\">Maxwell Smart</a>.)</p> \n\n<p>How do you keep a monstrous blowout from going public? As one of the arresting cops told us with odd pride, &#8220;BP drives this country.&#8221; It drives it with cash. Robert Ebel, former chief of oil analysis for the CIA, estimates that at least <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Energy-Conflict-Central-Asia-Caucasus/dp/0742500632\" type=\"external\">$140 million in payments</a> by BP for Azeri oil has gone unaccounted for. Where did it go? Notably, the Aliyev ruling family lives like pashas despite the president&#8217;s official salary of $100 a month.</p> \n\n<p>Oil worker advocate Mirvari Gahramanli said she was beaten by police for raising questions. In case I doubted it, she showed me photographs of a dozen cops slamming her with long clubs.</p> \n\n<p>What&#8217;s worse, while I was tossed out of the country (it would have looked bad to throw a TV reporter into a dungeon), my witnesses disappeared.</p> \n\n<p>WikiLeaks and oily lies</p> \n\n<p>Just five months before the Deepwater Horizon spill, Rainey &#8212; BP&#8217;s vice president for Gulf exploration &#8212; testified before the U.S. Congress that the company had drilled offshore &#8220;for the last 50 years in a manner both safe and protective of the environment.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BP&#8217;s testimony was a lie. The Caspian rig had blown out a year earlier.</p> \n\n<p>But the lie was good enough for Congress. Based on Rainey&#8217;s assurances, legislators pressured the Department of the Interior to drop objections to plans for drilling in the Gulf&#8217;s deep waters.</p> \n\n<p>Withholding information from Congress is a felony. But Rainey has one heck of a defense: The U.S. State Department was in on the cover-up.</p> \n\n<p>Deep in the pile of confidential State Department cables released by one courageous U.S. soldier, Pfc. Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning, we have the notes from a secret meeting between the U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan, Anne E. Derse, and the chief of BP&#8217;s Caspian operation.</p> \n\n<p>The hugger-mugger was demanded by BP&#8217;s American partners, Chevron and Exxon. The U.S. oil companies had complained to the State Department that they were no longer getting their piece of the Caspian loot and BP wouldn&#8217;t tell them why. (You&#8217;ll remember that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was a member of Chevron&#8217;s board.)</p> \n\n<p>In the memo, which you can see in our film &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.palastinvestigativefund.org/?id=65\" type=\"external\">Vultures and Vote Rustlers</a>,&#8221; the U.S. ambassador provides the details of the blowout of the bad cement on the BP rig.</p> \n\n<p>The State Department kept schtum (quiet) about it, not even warning U.S. safety regulators. And Exxon and Chevron&#8217;s chiefs joined BP&#8217;s Rainey in the mendacious sales pitch to Congress, testifying, despite their knowledge, that their offshore drilling methods were as safe as a game of checkers.</p> \n\n<p>Justice is not always abused: Rainey was indicted on a felony charge of obstruction of Congress. However, the charge centers on a relatively minor falsehood: his alleged understatement of the amount of oil bursting into the Gulf. Neither Rainey nor BP will be tried for the deadlier lie to Congress &#8212; the prior blowout caused by the penny-pinching quick-dry cement &#8212; because the U.S. government is itself complicit in the cover-up.</p> \n\n<p>Blowbacks and blowouts</p> \n\n<p>And that&#8217;s why we are seeing the red carpet rolled out for BP in the Gulf once more.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The Deepwater Horizon rig in flames. Photo by Palast Investigative Fund</p> \n\n<p>When the U.S. government participates in the corruption of other democracies, when it authorizes bribery and ignores police-state tactics to benefit from business deals, the sins of empire can come back to haunt the nation. In the CIA&#8217;s world this is called &#8220;blowback.&#8221; What was covered up in Baku has killed Americans in the Gulf, and it will likely continue to kill.</p> \n\n<p>And bribery does not simply stay &#8220;over there.&#8221; American officials are not as different from the Baku bandits as they may like to believe. The agency in charge of regulating BP&#8217;s drilling in the Gulf, the U.S. Minerals Management Service, was rife with watchdogs who, like their Azeri counterparts, took backhanders and payouts from BP. And when I say BP was in bed with the regulators, that is not a metaphor: A BP lobbyist was reportedly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/washington/11royalty.html\" type=\"external\">sleeping with</a> a chief of the agency.Don&#8217;t bother sending Rainey a file in a cake: The BP man won&#8217;t get two minutes of jail time. His trial has been suspended indefinitely.</p> \n\n<p>Immunity from law is not new to BP. As I <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">reported</a> last month, BP was the main culprit in the disaster caused by the Exxon Valdez grounding. The company walked away without paying a dime to the victims. In the case of the Deepwater Horizon, a few tenacious attorneys have ensured the corporation pays some compensation in the Gulf. But that money comes nowhere close to the damage it caused and will do nothing to harm the company&#8217;s bottom line.</p> \n\n<p>The oil is still there</p> \n\n<p>Today BP has declared Gulf waters clean, as if Mother Nature were just a toilet you can poop in and flush.

CEO Satya Nadella continues to put his stamp on the company, announcing Wednesday an executive shuffle that involves the departure of former Nokia Corp. chief Stephen Elop.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Elop was the biggest surprise departure in the executive shuffle. Two other Microsoft executives, Kirill Tatarinov and Eric Rudder, will, like Mr. Elop \"leave Microsoft after a designated transition period,\" the company said in a news release. Separately, Mark Penn, who had served in a senior strategist role, is leaving Microsoft as well.</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Elop's departure is the latest sign Microsoft is hitting the reset button on its struggling smartphone hardware business. The more than $9 billion purchase of Nokia's handset business--a deal struck by Mr. Nadella's predecessor Steve Ballmer in late 2013--was supposed to make Microsoft a relevant player in smartphones.</p> \n\n<p>Microsoft declined to make Mr. Elop available for an interview.</p> \n\n<p>Instead under Mr. Elop's leadership at Microsoft, the company's Windows smartphones lost market share and bled red ink. The company recently said it planned to further cut costs at the smartphone business and other hardware units. Nokia already was targeted for thousands of job cuts in the biggest layoffs in Microsoft's history, announced last year.</p> \n\n<p>Last July, in an email that rankled some with an introduction of \"Hello there,\" Mr. Elop outlined 12,500 Microsoft job cuts and underlined the challenges the unit was facing.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>\"It is particularly important to recognize that the role of phones within Microsoft is different than it was within Nokia,\" he wrote. \"Our device strategy must reflect Microsoft's strategy and must be accomplished within an appropriate financial envelope. Therefore, we plan to make some changes.\"</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Elop had been viewed as a potential successor to Mr. Ballmer, and his return to the company was seen as setting the table for him to win respect in Microsoft's board room as directors searched for a new CEO. In February 2014, Mr. Nadella was appointed to the job.</p> \n\n<p>Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets, said Elop's exit \"speaks to Microsoft's view that Nokia and the overall mobile strategy was clearly not heading down the right path.\"</p> \n\n<p>Microsoft's hardware devices businesses, which Mr. Elop ran, will now be folded into a new division with Microsoft's operating systems group. Terry Myerson, also an executive vice president, will lead the division.</p>", "title": "Key Executive Changes Shake Up Microsoft", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2015/06/17/key-executive-changes-shake-up-microsoft.html", "published_at": "2016-03-04", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>This article is being republished as part of our daily reproduction of WSJ.com articles that also appeared in the U.S. print edition of The Wall Street Journal (October 4, 2017).</p> \n\n<p>Broadcast television networks and metro newspapers are about to get a boost from an unexpected but familiar source: Big Tobacco.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>It's an old media buy to resolve an old fight. Starting as soon as next month, Altria Group Inc. and British American Tobacco PLC will begin running court-mandated ads to put to rest a lawsuit brought nearly two decades ago by the U.S. Department of Justice over misleading statements the industry had made about cigarettes and their health effects.</p> \n\n<p>The television spots, between 30 and 45 seconds long, will run in prime time five days a week for 52 weeks, and will appear mostly on ABC, CBS or NBC, Altria said. They won't have the graphic images of a typical antismoking public service announcement. Instead, these ads will be reminiscent of the disclosure statement at the end of a pharmaceutical ad, displaying court-mandated text in black on a white screen with a voice narration.</p> \n\n<p>\"Altria, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard, and Philip Morris USA intentionally designed cigarettes to make them more addictive,\" one ad will say. Another reads: \"More people die every year from smoking than from murder, AIDS, suicide, drugs, car crashes, and alcohol, combined.\"</p> \n\n<p>Although the starkness of the black-and-white text ads could be persuasive because they are so out of the ordinary, ad executives said, it is unclear how effective they will be in an age when fewer young people are watching broadcast TV or reading newspapers.</p> \n\n<p>\"The good news for the tobacco companies is they'll avoid a lot of their younger audience\" who would be more likely to see a video ad on Facebook than a prime-time TV ad, said John Boiler, co-founder of 72andSunny, an agency that does work for the antitobacco nonprofit Truth Campaign. \"I think they're getting off kind of lightly.\"</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Marlboro maker Altria, which owns Philip Morris USA, estimates that it will spend $31 million to broadcast and publish the statements on TV, in newspapers, on company-owned websites and in pamphlets tucked inside the cellophane wrappers on cigarette packs. A spokesman for BAT's U.S. subsidiary Reynolds American, which makes Camels and acquired Newport maker Lorillard in 2015, declined to say how much the company expects to spend.</p> \n\n<p>All the defendants named in the Justice Department's 1999 lawsuit are now owned by either Altria or BAT.</p> \n\n<p>Full-page print ads will appear in at least 45 newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal, starting as soon as Nov. 26, according to a document filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Monday evening by attorneys for Altria, BAT and the Justice Department, outlining their agreement. The print ads will run on five weekends spread over about four months, according to the court filing. Ads will also appear on the newspapers' websites.</p> \n\n<p>Tobacco companies used to be a staple of Madison Avenue ad agencies with figures like the Marlboro Man and Joe Camel, but they have sharply curbed their advertising spending in the U.S. They are no longer allowed to advertise their products on television or billboards, and their legal settlements have funded more than $1 billion dollars in antismoking campaigns.</p> \n\n<p>\"This industry has changed dramatically over the last 20 years,\" Altria's General Counsel Murray Garnick said in a statement, noting that the company supported the 2009 law that gave the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate tobacco. \"We're focused on the future and... working to develop less risky tobacco products.\"</p> \n\n<p>The FDA recently unveiled plans to overhaul how it regulates tobacco, aiming to reduce nicotine in cigarettes so they're no longer addictive and encourage cigarette smokers to switch to less harmful alternatives.</p> \n\n<p>Write to Jennifer Maloney at jennifer.maloney@wsj.com</p> \n\n<p>(END) Dow Jones Newswires</p> \n\n<p>October 04, 2017 02:47 ET (06:47 GMT)</p>", "title": "Big Tobacco's New U.S. Ads Will Be Critical of Smoking -- WSJ", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2017/10/04/big-tobaccos-new-u-s-ads-will-be-critical-smoking-wsj.html", "published_at": "2017-10-04", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Blackwater&#8217;s recent troubles (the alleged indiscriminate killing of Iraqi civilians by the company&#8217;s &#8220;independent contractors&#8221;) have led to speculation that Erik Prince, Blackwater&#8217;s founder and president, may seek to lead his company into new and perhaps less controversial lines of business.

Politicians from the President on down state that creating jobs for American workers is their top priority. Often any jobs, as with the low-wage jobs that Texas Governor Rick Perry brags he &#8220;created.&#8221; Sometimes they want to create &#8220;good paying&#8221; jobs. But in this discourse having a job is everything, because it allows one to pay the bills and avoid poverty.</p> \n\n<p>Those who worked with Jean Alonso making missiles in a Massachusetts defense plant &#8211; referred to as American Missile and Communications Corporation but sounding suspiciously like Massachusetts-based Raytheon &#8211; knew how important it was to have a job in this society. But they also recognized that &#8221;good jobs&#8221; should mean far more than good-paying ones. And they knew, from their own bitter experience, that many jobs can be toxic, destroying the mind and soul, and sometimes the body as well of those who work them.</p> \n\n<p>Alonso&#8217;s book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1463538812/counterpunchmaga\" type=\"external\">The Patriots: An Inside Look at Life in a Defense Plant</a> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1463538812/counterpunchmaga\" type=\"external\">&amp;#160;</a> begins as the missiles fly at the start of the first Gulf War. The fragile community in the plant is strained by tensions between the patriotic workers and Alonso with her antiwar views and activities. Alonso copes with her own anguish by conducting an informal survey of how her coworkers feel about their work. She learns that these coworkers are filled with a profound sense of hopelessness and despair:</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I feel like a zero.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Inferior.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Empty.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Helpless.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very depressed and anxious.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so unhappy here I get aches and pains from it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Apathetic. I can&#8217;t do anything at home anymore but watch TV.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I was a musician, you know, so I still need to write everyday &#8211; if you don&#8217;t you have no soul. But I go home and I&#8217;m too tired.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I feel like there&#8217;s something crushed inside &#8211; I feel really defeated. It&#8217;s like giving up on your whole self in order to make a living &#8211; you can&#8217;t figure a way out.&#8221; (pp. 10-11).</p> \n\n<p>These responses, expressing feelings that had never been spoken among these workers, start Alonso and a small group of coworkers on a journey to make sense of what was happening to them at work and why. Through monthly meetings buttressed by Alonso&#8217;s library research, they explore the deadening effects of repetitive work accompanied by social powerlessness in the workplace. They try to understand Alonso&#8217;s realization that &#8220;something in this work is changing us, as if we were living by Love Canal&#8221; (p. 37).</p> \n\n<p>Over the next couple of years this group of defense plant workers examine their dashed hopes and dreams as well as an extensive body of social science literature, in an attempt to figure out just how the work was changing them. They confessed to each other that their ability to reason had diminished after years in the plant. The lack of mental stimulation was reducing their very intelligence. And, indeed, as Alonso learned from her reading, a German researcher had found that IQ declines following years of unskilled labor. This cognitive decline didn&#8217;t seem so surprising to the workers when one of them recalled being told by a supervisor, &#8220;You don&#8217;t get paid to think.&#8221; These workers discovered through their own experience that mindless work induces mindlessness.</p> \n\n<p>Alonso later realized that the experience of the American Missile workers wouldn&#8217;t have seemed strange to Adam Smith, who in 1776 wrote of the mind-destroying effects of unskilled work as an unfortunate but inevitable consequence of the then new industrial system:</p> \n\n<p>The understanding of the greater part of men is necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man&#8217;s whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations and he naturally loses, therefore, the habit [of solving problems] and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become&#8230; But in every improved and civilized society this is the state into which the laboring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall (p. 180).</p> \n\n<p>In addition to cognitive problems, the plant workers confronted elevated depression, anxiety, and apathy. Alonso&#8217;s research convinced her that these symptoms were similar to those experienced by victims of what psychologist Judith Herman called &#8220;complex chronic post-traumatic stress syndrome&#8221; or CCPTSD. She quotes Herman as saying that those suffering from CCPTSD &#8220;have a history of subjection to totalitarian control over a prolonged period of time&#8221; (p. 125).</p> \n\n<p>The shop floor environment that Alonso and her fellow workers experienced daily was, indeed, totalitarian. Every motion was monitored. Bathroom breaks were strictly regulated.&amp;#160; Supervisors yelled at workers as if they were disobedient children. Conversations were monitored and often forbidden. Escape, while not impossible, became ever more difficult as years in the plant went by and economic chains bound the workers.</p> \n\n<p>In her efforts to better understand the totalitarian aspects of her work environment, Alonso studied military culture and found many similarities to the culture at American Missile. The similarities were not accidental. She realized that the company deliberately sought out supervisors with military backgrounds. The fact that the company was part of the military-industrial complex, producing missiles for US wars, probably made military culture especially desirable to management.</p> \n\n<p>At the time that Alonso writes about, relations between workers in the plant were especially stressed as many of the workers sought a sense of meaning and community through patriotic identification with the company&#8217;s missile-producing mission and with the war in progress and became less tolerant of those questioning the war. Pressure to not rock the boat increased as demand for the missiles rose.</p> \n\n<p>Like many manufacturing companies, American Missile had a union. Unfortunately, this was as much a part of the problem as part of the solution. Union officials refused to pursue cases of sexual abuse, wouldn&#8217;t recognize the women&#8217;s committee founded by Alonso and others, and systematically harassed militants. Thus, much of the energy to improve the workplace was channeled into often futile attempts at union reform.</p> \n\n<p>Throughout The Patriots: An Inside Look at Life in a Defense Plant Alonso weaves her personal account of nearly two decades in the factory with an account of the research into the effects of the work environment on workers. The result is one of the most thought provoking books you will find to read this year. As the politicians talk endlessly about &#8220;jobs&#8221; while providing few, Alonso reminds us that a good society will provide not just jobs, or even well-paying jobs, but jobs that enhance the spirit and development of those who work them.</p> \n\n<p>Surely today, 235 years after Adam Smith described the mind-destroying nature of unskilled work, an &#8220;improved and civilized society,&#8221; &#8211; as Smith described the new industrial capitalism &#8211; should be one that proves him wrong. Such a society would be one in which all who work find that their jobs enhance their thinking, spirit, and sense of humanity. Such a society would be one in which workers are not merely the tools of the already wealthy and powerful, but makers of a more decent world for themselves, their fellow workers, and the rest of society. While the politicians beholden to the powerful are not likely to be concerned with this goal, surely the vast majority of us ought to be.</p> \n\n<p>What did you learn in the morning? How much did you know in the afternoon? Were you content in the evening? Did they teach you how to question when you were at the school? Did the factory help you grow, were you the maker or the tool?

George Lucas, heady with the success of American Graffiti in 1973, conceived the series two years later. It was to be the story of Anakin Skywalker&#8217;s rise, fall and ultimate redemption. Since the story was too large for one film, he divided it into two trilogies and decided (for reasons best known to him) to make the second trilogy before the first one.</p> \n\n<p>He offered the science fiction concept to Universal Studios, who had produced American Graffiti. In a decision they would regret badly in the years to come, Universal passed on it because they dismissed the story as &#8220;unfathomable and silly.&#8221; In fact, every single studio in Hollywood passed on it except for 20th Century Fox.</p> \n\n<p>The first film in the series was released in 1977. By the end of its first theatrical run, it had become the most successful in the history of cinema and turned Lucas into a multi-millionaire. In the decades to come, the Star Wars brand would acquire a cult following equally among the young and the old. Some would be drawn to it because of the lure of space travel. Others would love the stunning special effects that became its hallmark. And many would love its portrayal of war between good and evil. Located in a &#8220;galaxy far, far away,&#8221; war seemed glorious.</p> \n\n<p>However, it you strip the exotic location and the stunning special effects, the film is a gripping portrayal of the arrogance, anger and hostility that drive people to make war on planet Earth. By not calling it &#8220;Earth Wars,&#8221; Lucas ensured that millions of people seeking to escape the real wars going on around them would become moviegoers.</p> \n\n<p>Addressing the Asian defense ministers in Singapore earlier this month, an indignant US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld asked why China was increasing its defense spending in consecutive years by double-digit percentages since it faced no immediate threats. He said such high spending rates could destabilize the Asian military balance. One may, of course, ask the same question of Rumsfeld. The only known enemies of the US are non-state actors that hardly justify the type and level of military spending that it is engaged in.</p> \n\n<p>While accounting for only 5 percent of the world&#8217;s population, the US accounts for half of global defense spending, according to figures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. For the first time since the end of the Cold War, global military spending topped a trillion dollars last year. This amounts to 2.6 percent of the world&#8217;s gross domestic product and represents an expenditure of $162 for every man, woman and child on the planet.</p> \n\n<p>In addition to spending $500 billion annually on its military, the US has allocated $238 billion to prosecute the global war on terror since 2003. As Jeffrey Sachs of the Earth Institute argues in his new book, &#8220;The End Of Poverty,&#8221; the US has unfortunately neglected the deeper causes of global instability that lead to terror. Its spending on extremely poor people who live on a daily income of less than a dollar a day is about 3 percent of its defense budget. These people are chronically hungry, ill, and uneducated. They lack basic housing and clothing. Today, there are 1.1 billion such people in the globe, all in danger of being killed by poverty.</p> \n\n<p>Yet a callous world continues to increase military spending. No where is this more evident than in South Asia, where defense spending grew by 14 percent last year, compared to a global average growth rate of 5 percent.</p> \n\n<p>While always arguing that it is not engaged in an arms race with India, Pakistan has just raised its defense spending by 16 percent to $3.8 billion. The saving grace is that in the same budget, the government has announced it will raise infrastructure development spending by almost 35 percent to $4.6 billion. Higher economic growth rates in the 6 to 8 percent range have made it possible to raise spending on both defense and development. However, this should not be taken to mean that there is no trade-off between spending on development and defense. If there is any ironclad law in economics, it is that there is no free lunch.</p> \n\n<p>Peace economist Kanta Marwah and Nobel laureate Lawrence Klein have published an analysis of the impact of defense spending on economic growth, drawing upon data from five Latin American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Peru. During the 1970s and 1980s, these countries spent on average 3.3 percent of their GDP on defense, which translated into an annual military expenditure of $7.4 billion (measured in 1990 US dollars). Marwah and Klein quantify the &#8220;hidden cost&#8221; of defense spending during this period, by assessing how much it lowered the rate of economic growth.</p> \n\n<p>Applying econometric methods to annual data over the 1970-91 time frame, they find that military spending had a negative impact on economic growth in all five countries. The worst affected country was Paraguay and the least affected was Bolivia. To determine the impact of the defense burden, they simulated what would have happened had the burden been reduced to 1 percent of GDP, emulating the spending cap set by the Central American nation of Costa Rica.</p> \n\n<p>Marwah and Klein find that high military spending caused Argentina to lose nearly 2 percentage points in its annual economic growth rate during the 1976-81 period. It was during this time that the generals in Argentina waged a &#8220;dirty war&#8221; after having overthrown the civilian government of Isabel Peron.</p> \n\n<p>Similarly, Chile lost annually 1 to 1.5 percentage points in its economic growth rate between 1974 to 1988, when the military government of August Pinochet held sway, after having overthrown the government of Salvadore Allende. For the five countries collectively, excessive military spending took off 1.5 percentage points of the annual rate of economic growth.</p> \n\n<p>The findings of this exercise in revisionist history are very revealing and worth pondering over by governments in all developing countries who are seeking a brighter future for their citizens. In particular, they should be of interest to the leaders of South Asia, which is home to a third of the world&#8217;s poor.</p> \n\n<p>Pakistan and India need to take the lead in reducing the defense burden on their populations, especially now that their longstanding tensions seem to be dissipating. Capping (and eventually reducing) military spending would be the ultimate confidence building measure on the road to peace.</p> \n\n<p>AHMAD FARUQUI is a member of <a href=\"http://www.epsusa.org/\" type=\"external\">Economists for Peace and Security</a> and can be reached at <a href=\"mailto:faruqui@pacbell.net\" type=\"external\">faruqui@pacbell.net</a>.</p> \n\n<p>This article was first published in Daily Times, Pakistan.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "Star Wars or Earth Wars?", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2005/06/18/star-wars-or-earth-wars/", "published_at": "2005-06-18", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Shares of Papa John's International Inc. fell more than 3% late Tuesday as the pizza chain reported quarterly sales below Wall Street expectations.

All nine banks about to get a total equity capital injection of $125 billion, courtesy of phase one of the bailout plan, reserved $108 billion during 2008 in order to pay for compensation and bonuses ( <a href=\"http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20081028142433.pdf\" type=\"external\">.pdf</a>). Guess who&#8217;ll end up footing the bill?</p> \n\n<p>Helping to pay these awards was not supposed to be part of the bailout plan. On the contrary, when the Senate, including Obama, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;amp;session=2&amp;amp;vote=00213\" type=\"external\">approved</a> the $700 billion package in October, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson called this package one that would loosen the credit markets. The idea was that banks would start lending to each other again, as well as to citizens and small businesses.</p> \n\n<p>That hasn&#8217;t happened, which is why it&#8217;s particularly offensive that this no-strings-attached money is going to line the pockets of the biggest executives on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs, the country&#8217;s top investment bank (which since September 21 calls itself a bank holding company), set aside $11.4 billion during the first nine months of this year to cover bonus payments for its 443 senior partners and other employees. That&#8217;s one-third less than last year&#8217;s amount, but only slightly more than the firm&#8217;s $10 billion US government gift. Economic woes notwithstanding, those partners are still <a href=\"http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/wall-streets-bonus-hopes-linger-despite-losses/?hp\" type=\"external\">expected to make</a> at least $5 million each. While Wall Street may not believe in higher taxes for the richest citizens, it does believe in higher bonuses for top executives. The bulk of bonus money on Wall Street concentrates there, after ferocious internal discussions about how much each person&#8217;s contribution to the firm is worth, no matter what the market conditions are on the outside. Trust me, I witnessed too many of these during my time on Wall Street. They are exercises in pure, unadulterated whines of entitlement.</p> \n\n<p>Goldman&#8217;s CEO, Lloyd C. Blankfein, bagged a record bonus last year of $67.9 million, including $26.8 million in cash. That amount was nearly double the $38 million that Hank Paulson made at the firm in 2005, the year before he became the treasury secretary, a post for which he received <a href=\"http://www.ustreas.gov/organization/bios/paulson-e.html\" type=\"external\">unanimous approval</a> from the Senate in 2006.</p> \n\n<p>Last year, when the financial crisis was just in brewing mode, the top five investment banks paid themselves $39 billion in compensation and bonuses, up 6 percent from 2006. Two of those firms, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, went bankrupt this year. Bank of America is acquiring a third, Merrill Lynch. The remaining two, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, have seen their stock values plummet more than 60 percent.</p> \n\n<p>Yet that didn&#8217;t stop their election money from pouring out. Goldman was Obama&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;amp;cid=N00009638\" type=\"external\">largest corporate campaign contributor</a>, with $874,207. Also in the Obama top 20 were three other recipients of bailout capital injections: JPM, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley. In the spirit of not sacrificing Main Street for Wall Street, this shouldn&#8217;t matter.</p> \n\n<p>Last week ( <a href=\"http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20081028142314.pdf\" type=\"external\">.pdf</a>), House Oversight Committee chairman Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) gave the bailout capital recipient firms until November 10 to come up with some darn good reasons to be paying themselves so much. Specifically, he requested detailed information on the total and average compensation per year from 2006 to 2008, the number of employees expected to be paid more than $500,000 in total compensation, and the total compensation projected for the top 10 executives.</p> \n\n<p>Similarly, New York state attorney general Andrew Cuomo demanded information about this year&#8217;s bonuses, requesting a detailed accounting of expected payments to top management, including the size of the firm&#8217;s expected bonus pool both before and after knowing that it would be a recipient of taxpayer funds.</p> \n\n<p>As Cuomo told the firms, &#8220;The American taxpayer has provided substantial funds to your firm; the preservation of those funds is a vital obligation of your company. Taxpayers are in many ways now like shareholders of your company, and your firm has a responsibility to them ( <a href=\"http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2008/oct/bank_letter.pdf\" type=\"external\">.pdf</a>).&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>House Financial Service Committee chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) concurred. &#8220;Any use of the these funds for any purpose other than lending&#8212;for bonuses, for severance pay, for dividends, for acquisitions of other institutions, etc.&#8212;is a <a href=\"http://www.house.gov/frank/tarp103108.html\" type=\"external\">violation of the terms</a> of the [Troubled Assets Relief Program] Act.&#8221; Next week, his committee will hold oversight hearings on the matter.</p> \n\n<p>To combat these inquires, Wall Street has gone into its best defense mode, projecting an aura of being accommodating and self-deprecating (because it is shedding jobs, too), in order to remain in its status-quo state of self-regulation. Banks are going to tell Congress that of course they won&#8217;t use that $125 billion for bonuses&#8212;it will go to shoring up balance sheets and for acquisitions just like they promised, whereas the bonus money will come from earnings, as it always does.</p> \n\n<p>If that sounds like accounting prattle, it&#8217;s because it is. It doesn&#8217;t matter where in the balance sheet capital comes from or goes; the point is, there&#8217;s more of it because of taxpayer redistribution in the wrong direction than there would have been otherwise, and that is not just.</p> \n\n<p>According to Gar Alperovitz, economist and coauthor with Lew Daly of the book <a href=\"http://www.thenewpress.com/index.php?option=com_title&amp;amp;task=view_title&amp;amp;metaproductid=1741\" type=\"external\">Unjust Deserts</a>, that beautifully explains why too much money goes to those whose contributions are marginal compared to the historical contribution of others before them. &#8220;We&#8217;re making homeowners take a big hit, and if there&#8217;s any justification for any of these bonuses, which is dubious, sharing that burden is important.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>That&#8217;s not quite the sharing that Wall Street wanted from the bailout package, but if &#8220;change has come to America,&#8221; as per Obama&#8217;s promise, then it&#8217;s time for Wall Street to shoulder its share. Taxpayers will not be getting a personal return on their capital from Goldman Sachs partners. Getting involved in decisively saving taxpayer money from being distributed to the likes of Lloyd Blankfein before these payments are made would be an excellent way for Obama to invoke immediate change.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "And Now, Back to the Economy", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2008/11/and-now-back-economy/", "published_at": "2008-11-07", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Gov.

The first is the rather obvious truism that candidates really do matter come election time. George W. Bush, of course, captured a near-historic percentage of the Hispanic vote, 40 percent in 2004. But he did this in part by distancing himself from the negative perceptions that Hispanics had of the Republican Party in general. Only 18 percent of Hispanics consider the GOP to be &#8220;accepting of different cultures&#8221;&#8212;indeed, the Democratic Party has a 40 point lead on the issue&#8212;but 30 percent thought the same of Bush himself. 30 percent is nothing to brag about in tolerance contests, but difference came in handy on election day. Unfortunately for the GOP, no other presidential name for 2008 seems to carry a similar personal advantage.</p> \n\n<p>Now as to why Kerry did relatively poorly among Hispanics, some 39 percent claimed that they had no idea &#8220;what he stood for.&#8221; Yeah, well, so it goes, we&#8217;ve heard this ad infinitum and it&#8217;s not clear what Democrats can do about this besides, perhaps, run a more comprehensible candidate (Hispanics give Bill Clinton, for instance, an overwhelmingly warm personal rating). Anyway, the second reason&#8212;28 percent&#8212;had to do with Kerry&#8217;s &#8220;permissiveness on abortion and gay marriage,&#8221; which would appear to give &#8220;centrist&#8221; Democrats <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0121/p03s01-uspo.html\" type=\"external\">yet another excuse</a> to sacrifice abortion rights in order to reclaim swing voters. But if you look a bit farther down, a pro-life Democrat would run only slightly better than a pro-choice Democrat, and support for stem cell research pretty much swamps any edge an abortion foe could bring. (Obviously a pro-life, pro-stem cell candidate would do best, but Bill Frist&#8217;s delusions of the White House aside, there aren&#8217;t many presidential contenders who take this view.)</p> \n\n<p>Meanwhile, one should note that Hispanic voters under 30 and Hispanic voters with a college education are overwhelmingly pro-choice (60 and 62 percent respectively). So Bush may have won himself a slight advantage in 2004 on the issue, but over time&#8212;given changing demographics and, one would hope, a greater proportion of Hispanics going to college&#8212;abortion will turn into a much less successful wedge issue for Republicans to wield.

Labor Notes interviewed two activists about the executive order and what&#8217;s next in the fight for immigrant rights.</p> \n\n<p>Arianna Salgado is a Chicago-based immigrant and education activist and member of the <a href=\"http://www.iyjl.org/\" type=\"external\">Immigrant Youth Justice League</a>.&amp;#160;Guillermo Perez is the President of the Pittsburgh Labor Council on Latin American Advancement (LCLAA), a member activist in the steelworkers union (USW) local 3657, and a member of the Labor Notes policy committee.</p> \n\n<p>Tell us about your experience in the immigrant rights movement.</p> \n\n<p>Arianna Salgado:&amp;#160;I&#8217;m undocumented but I have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival [DACA], which provides me with a work permit and Social Security number and protection against deportation. I&#8217;ve been involved in the immigrant rights movement since 2010 or 2011&#8230; through the issue of access to education for undocumented students.</p> \n\n<p>Eventually I got involved in the fight against deportations and detentions. We were trying to highlight the reality that people who are in detention or who are facing deportation aren&#8217;t these criminals that we&#8217;re often times made to believe.</p> \n\n<p>Guillermo Perez:&amp;#160;I&#8217;ve been involved in the fight to reform the immigration laws for 15 years. My involvement came from representing undocumented workers who were in the union that I was working for. I really see the fight for immigration reform as a labor fight, because I think that the question of immigration is fundamentally a labor question.</p> \n\n<p>The thing that we were fighting for all along was to achieve something in the way of protections for people so that they could become full-fledged participants in our society, without any regard to whether they had papers or not. In LCLAA we say,&amp;#160;&#8220;las luchas obreras no tienen fronteras,&#8221;&amp;#160;&#8220;workers&#8217; fights don&#8217;t have borders.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Obama&#8217;s announcement centered on the creation of a new immigrant status called Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA). What do you think of this new status for undocumented parents of children who are citizens or permanent residents?</p> \n\n<p>GP:&amp;#160;I think it&#8217;s an important achievement. It&#8217;s the product of tremendous struggle on the part of immigrant rights activists who really put pressure on this president to do something about the situation. As a victory we have to take it, and we have to build on it.</p> \n\n<p>The White House claims that over 5 million immigrants could be eligible for the new and expanded statuses, out of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Immigrants cannot yet apply for DAPA or the expanded DACA. The changes are expected to happen incrementally in the coming months, unless they are somehow blocked by Congress.</p> \n\n<p>There are 5 million people eligible for DAPA and this now expanded DACA program. The challenge is getting those folks to apply, get them legal status, and make sure that they never lose it. If we don&#8217;t get enough people into the program, then it&#8217;s more likely that it could be taken away.</p> \n\n<p>AS:&amp;#160;I think it&#8217;s definitely a step towards the right direction. We&#8217;re very well aware of the fact that it doesn&#8217;t cover even half of the people in our community. But we understand how it may be significant to those that it does cover.</p> \n\n<p>The much-accepted narrative is that if an individual is in detention or deportation proceedings then they must have done something really bad to get there. But what we find is that these are individuals who were just picked up, sometimes on routine traffic checks. Even though President Obama has announced DACA and DAPA, the reality is that the deportations will not decrease. This announcement doesn&#8217;t really impact that.</p> \n\n<p>What do you think of Obama&#8217;s claim that DAPA will allow millions of undocumented immigrants to &#8220;come out of the shadows?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>AS:&amp;#160;It&#8217;s important to highlight that this whole concept of &#8220;coming out of the shadows&#8221; is&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://labornotes.org/blogs/2014/03/no-papers-no-fear\" type=\"external\">something that comes from the grassroots</a>; it doesn&#8217;t come after a politician provides some sort of announcement. The concept of &#8220;coming out of the shadows&#8221; is something that people who are undocumented have been doing since about 2010.</p> \n\n<p>I can only speak to DACA, because that&#8217;s the only one that has a process right now, but that might give us some insight into how people might react to DAPA. Individuals who have applied to DACA understand that it doesn&#8217;t provide us a pathway to permanent legalization, but also understand that it does provide us with some new resources. Before, we weren&#8217;t able to work legally, we didn&#8217;t have the ability to consider different employment options because we didn&#8217;t have a Social Security number.</p> \n\n<p>Something that DAPA may bring is the ability to have more employment options other than just what individuals have had access to, which is usually really low-wage jobs. I&#8217;m not saying that all of a sudden people are going to have access to great jobs and pay and benefits, but at least it does provide a bit more opportunity than what people had before.</p> \n\n<p>GP:&amp;#160;I think that it&#8217;s vitally important that we convince people that it&#8217;s worth doing. In some ways it&#8217;s no different than an organizing campaign that we wage. When we talk to workers and they say, &#8220;Can I get fired for joining the union?&#8221; Yeah, it&#8217;s a possibility, but if you don&#8217;t join then nothing&#8217;s ever going to change.</p> \n\n<p>Some have criticized DAPA&#8217;s eligibility requirements (high fees, criminal background checks, five years&#8217; proof of residency in the U.S., a citizen or permanent resident child). How would you respond?</p> \n\n<p>AS:&amp;#160;It does require you to prove your continued presence in the Untied States. For those individuals who don&#8217;t have access to all the documents that are required, it will be a challenge.</p> \n\n<p>I can speak to the experience of some of my friends who have had to move since they&#8217;ve been in the country. They haven&#8217;t had the opportunity to collect documents that prove that they&#8217;ve been here since they were six. They&#8217;re now 20. That&#8217;s a problem.</p> \n\n<p>The announcement doesn&#8217;t do anything to address detention or deportation.</p> \n\n<p>We can also see how the U.S. citizen or resident child requirement may be challenging for LGBTQ families who may not be able to adopt children [or may only have one parent considered a legal guardian and therefore eligible for DAPA]. It leaves out people who don&#8217;t have U.S. citizen or resident children, even if they qualify under all the other requirements.</p> \n\n<p>What do you make of Obama&#8217;s announcement that he will end the&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/opinion/the-secure-communities-illusion.html?_r=0\" type=\"external\">much-criticized Secure Communities</a>&amp;#160;program?</p> \n\n<p>GP:&amp;#160;If there&#8217;s a certain amount of cynicism being expressed when it comes to this part of the executive action, I think it&#8217;s warranted. It&#8217;s a victory in a sense, but it&#8217;s like a contract victory. You fight like hell, you win something in a contract, but enforcement is everything. Is ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] really going to comply? The president&#8217;s record on this has not been great in the past, so people have every reason to be concerned. But that&#8217;s our job as activists: to bring it up and to give him grief if they&#8217;re not complying with what was supposed to be done.</p> \n\n<p>Employers are known to collude with ICE to retaliate against workers who are organizing by using I-9 audits&#8212;sometimes called&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.defendingdissent.org/now/news/immigration-enforcement-a-tool-to-silence-workers/\" type=\"external\">&#8220;silent raids&#8221;</a>&#8212;to intimidate and punish workers. Will Obama&#8217;s announcement have any effect on this workplace intimidation?</p> \n\n<p>GP:&amp;#160;I actually think the executive action could be a huge help. I think it will help us in organizing workplaces where there are substantial numbers of undocumented people who now will have some form of legal status.</p> \n\n<p>AS:&amp;#160;That&#8217;s one hope that I do have for this. Both of my parents qualify under our current understanding of the announcement. My mother has faced very bad work environments. When she tried to organize she was immediately fired, and struggled for a bit to find employment after that.</p> \n\n<p>Her employer was very well aware of the fact that she is undocumented. She had been there for 10 years. He said, &#8220;if I fire you, I know it&#8217;s going to be hard for you to find employment because you don&#8217;t have a Social [Security number].&#8221; So he knew that my mom was at a disadvantage, and that getting rid of her would stop a lot of the organizing that she was trying to create there. I&#8217;m hoping that, with access to these new resources, some of the fear will go away.</p> \n\n<p>How have you responded to Obama&#8217;s announcement?</p> \n\n<p>AS: I was one of the individuals&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/25/obama-heckled-immigration_n_6222256.html?utm_hp_ref=politics\" type=\"external\">who interrupted President Obama here in Chicago</a>&amp;#160;[in December]. We decided to take that action because we were with a family in which the father is in deportation proceedings. When we heard President Obama say that his priority was criminals, we felt the need to make sure that everyone understood that this is not true&#8230; This father does not match up with Obama&#8217;s description of a criminal, and yet he&#8217;s in deportation proceedings. Obama&#8217;s announcement isn&#8217;t going to help him.</p> \n\n<p>How can activists support immigrants in the ongoing struggle?</p> \n\n<p>GP:&amp;#160;I&#8217;d love to see union halls all over the country opening up and serving as places where people can come to get good information to apply. That would be beautiful. And that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re working towards in LCLAA.</p> \n\n<p>If you really support the immigrant rights movement and want to do something to address the fight of the undocumented, then find an organization that&#8217;s doing this work, give them money, volunteer your time, and also be out there on the street when they mobilize people to put pressure on politicians.</p> \n\n<p>This interview was first published at&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://labornotes.org/2014/12/interview-what-do-new-immigration-rules-mean\" type=\"external\">Labor Notes</a>.</p>", "title": "What Do Obama\u2019s New Immigration Rules Mean for Immigration Activists?", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/17503/what_do_obamas_new_immigration_rules_mean_for_immigration_activists", "published_at": "2015-01-05", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Watford has been fined nearly 4 million pounds ($5.1 million) for supplying falsified financial information to allow Italian businessman Gino Pozzo to become the club's owner.</p> \n\n<p>Watford pleaded guilty to submitting a forged bank letter to provide proof that Pozzo had enough funds to take over the club before the 2014-15 season.

For almost two years, I&#8217;ve been working as a cultural trainer to the U.S. military, teaching that the U.S. must know the heartland of Pakistan, from Karachi, a teeming city where so many operatives hide, to places such as southern Punjab, the heart of the country and home to the &#8220;Punjabi Taliban&#8221; and the foot soldiers involved in Pearl&#8217;s kidnapping. As a journalist, I choose to do the cultural training, because I&#8217;ll never forget the name Pearl put on the last picture I have with him. We were in Karachi, and he called it, &#8220;Clueless in Karachi.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>To know where so many men on the U.S. Most Wanted list have hidden is to know the geography of Pakistan&#8212;and not just the wild, wild west of the country&#8217;s border region with Afghanistan, but in its heartland and some of its finest neighborhoods, including military cantonments like the one near which bin Laden was killed. I created a Google map outlining cities where <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=209329569017179450454.0004a2442e4e34d5941a7\" type=\"external\">al-Qaeda operatives</a> have been picked up.

I&#8217;ve driven not far from it on the highway to Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a magical land that writer Rudyard Kipling traveled and wrote poetic prose about.</p> \n\n<p>Located on the Silk Road, known as the Korakoram Highway, it&#8217;s no outpost outside central government authority, like the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where so much U.S. military strategy and media attention has been focused. It&#8217;s home to the Pakistan Military Academy, the equivalent of Pakistan&#8217;s West Point. It&#8217;s also got an important military cantonment as the headquarters of a brigade in the Second Division of Pakistan&#8217;s Northern Army Corps.</p> \n\n<p>The namesake for Abbottabad, British Army Major James Abbott, founded the town in 1853, the &#8220;abad&#8221; in its name meaning &#8220;a place of living&#8221; in Urdu. Abbott wrote a poem called Abbottabad, enshrined in a <a href=\"http://www.panoramio.com/photo/21593241\" type=\"external\">city plaque</a>, that has an eerie ring today: &#8220;I remember the day when I first came here/And smelt the sweet Abbottabad air/The trees and ground covered with snow/Gave us indeed a brilliant show/To me the place seemed like a dream/And far ran a lonesome stream/The wind hissed as if welcoming us/The pine swayed creating a lot of fuss/And the tiny cuckoo sang it away/A song very melodious and gay/I adored the place from the first sight/And was happy that my coming here was right/And eight good years here passed very soon/And we leave our perhaps on a sunny noon/Oh Abbottabad we are leaving you now/ To your natural beauty do I bow/Perhaps your winds sound will never reach my ear/My gift for you is a few sad tears/I bid you farewell with a heavy heart/Never from my mind will your memories thwart.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Bin Laden is no longer a threat to the U.S., but a deeper problem remains: Pakistan&#8217;s safe harbor for men intent on harming the U.S.</p> \n\n<p>Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.</p> \n\n<p>A speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).</p> \n\n<p>In much the same whimsy, we act as if Pakistan has just had a simple &#8220;friendship&#8221; in America&#8217;s fight against al Qaeda, but the truth is that its role as a safe space for ideologues dates back to 1979. That year, an Islamist movement came to Pakistan under a military dictator, Gen. Zia ul Haq. Pakistani intelligence began supporting the mujahideen, or &#8220;freedom fighters.&#8221; In the years after, men from bin Laden to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) found an ideological and operational base in Pakistan. As a nation, we turned a blind eye because the freedom fighters were battling the U.S. enemy, the Soviet Union, after its 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. In 1989, the Soviets were defeated, and ideologues, including bin Laden, turned their eyes to attacks on the U.S.</p> \n\n<p>Since then, bin Laden&#8217;s killing is the latest in a long string of bad guys found, killed, or snatched in Pakistan. In 1993, we had our first attack on the World Trade Center, and on Feb. 17, 1995, according to media reports, U.S. officials raided room number 16 in the Su-Casa Guest House in the city of Islamabad and captured the operational leader of the 1993 World Trade Center attack, Ramzi Yousef, before he headed off for the border city of Peshawar. He was a Pakistani, and he was the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.</p> \n\n<p>In 1994, British-Pakistani Muslim militant Omar Sheikh was arrested in India for allegedly kidnapping an American in New Delhi. On Dec. 31, 1999, he was freed in exchange for prisoners taken captive on an Indian Airlines jet hijacked from Kathmandu, Nepal, and diverted to Kandahar, Afghanistan, the headquarters for the Taliban in their emergence to power in Afghanistan. At the airport to give the men a welcome home party, according to Sheikh&#8217;s FBI report: bin Laden, who was a guest of the Taliban in Kandahar. From Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, Omar Sheikh slipped easily into Pakistan, was feted at a party in the coastal city of Karachi and then settled down, marrying and welcoming a son, in the Punjab province capital of Lahore. He moved freely in Pakistan, though the U.S. pressed for extradition on the 1994 kidnapping charge. In early January 2002, Sheikh met Wall Street Journal reporter Pearl at the Akbar Hotel in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, outside Islamabad, and hatched his plot to kidnap him. On Feb. 5, 2002, Sheikh turned himself into Pakistani intelligence in the city of Lahore, and the ISI secretly held him for a week before telling the FBI and the CIA.</p> \n\n<p>The next month, in March 2002, FBI agents and CIA officials raided a safehouse in the city of Faisalabad, also in the province of Punjab, and picked up a senior al-Qaeda operational leader, Abu Zubaydah, who offered the U.S. its first clues that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the mastermind behind 9/11. He disclosed something we hardly ever acknowledge: al-Qaeda operatives, from &#8220;shoe bomber&#8221; Richard Reid to failed &#8220;dirty bomber&#8221; Jose Padilla, freely traveled the roads through Pakistan to get operational instructions from KSM in Karachi.</p> \n\n<p>That spring, KSM and another senior al-Qaeda operational leader Ramzi bin al-Shibh secretly gave an audacious interview to al Jazeera reporter Yosri Fouda, taking credit for 9/11. The interview aired on the first anniversary of 9/11, and, sure enough, on Sept. 11, 2002, U.S. officials picked up Ramzi bin al-Shibh in a safehouse in the posh Defence Housing Authority neighborhood of Karachi, not far from where I had rented a home months earlier.</p> \n\n<p>The next year, on March 1, 2003, where did CIA officials pick up Khalid Sheikh Mohammed? A comfortable home in a military cantonment in the city of Rawalpindi. The list goes on and on. It&#8217;s not shocking to me that bin Laden was killed in the heart of Pakistan. As a Muslim dedicated to defeating the ideology of men like bin Laden, I said to myself what it is we are taught to say as Muslims whenever anyone dies: \"Innalilahi wa inna ilayhi rajioon.\" It means: &#8220;To God we belong and to Him we will return.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Bin Laden is no longer a threat to the U.S., but a deeper problem remains: Pakistan&#8217;s safe harbor for men intent on harming the U.S. What matters now is that the U.S. stop enabling this very serious problem of Pakistan&#8217;s culture of denial for its base as a safe space for militants and al-Qaeda operatives. &#8220;Never from my mind will your memories thwart,&#8221; Major Abbott said of the city where, about 150 years later, Osama bin Laden, America&#8217;s No. 1 enemy in the world, was killed.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.asranomani.com/\" type=\"external\">Asra Q.

For example, Senator Jeff Merkley found himself on the receiving end of an <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">earlier Moron Alert</a> for claiming that the Supreme Court vacancy was a \"stolen seat,\" thus justifying a filibuster of Gorsuch's confirmation.</p> \n\n<p>Since then, news of Gorsuch has been relatively quiet. However, senior United States senator from New Mexico Tom Udall met with Gorsuch today. While he did not explicitly suggest whether he would vote for or against him, he gave the following idea to the press: Nominate Gorsuch and former Obama nominee Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court at the same time.</p> \n\n<p>Here was Udall's full comment:</p> \n\n<p>You had President Trump saying, &#8216;I want to unite the country, I&#8217;m a deal-maker, I&#8217;m going to bring people together. Well, the deal right now for President Trump, if he wanted to do it, would be to put Gorsuch and Merrick Garland on the court at the same time.</p> \n\n<p>Here was how Politico <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/tom-udall-neil-gorsuch-merrick-garland-235442\" type=\"external\">described</a> Udall's justification for his ludicrous idea to place ten justices on the Supreme Court:</p> \n\n<p>Trump would discuss the option with one of the three Supreme Court justices often mentioned as retirement prospects in the coming years &#8211; Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer or Anthony Kennedy &#8211; and secure a resignation letter from one of them, contingent on Garland getting nominated and confirmed as their replacement.</p> \n\n<p>This entire idea is ridiculous for a handful of reasons:</p> \n\n<p>First, the Supreme Court has consisted of nine justices ever since Congress <a href=\"http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/landmark_10.html\" type=\"external\">passed</a> the Judiciary Act of 1869. The law <a href=\"https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;amp;fileName=016/llsl016.db&amp;amp;recNum=79\" type=\"external\">states</a> the following and it has not been amended since:</p> \n\n<p>That the Supreme Court of the United States shall hereafter consist of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom shall constitute a quorum</p> \n\n<p>Second, the last attempt to increase the number of Supreme Court justices came from President Franklin Roosevelt in an <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-franklin-roosevelt-clashed-with-the-supreme-court-and-lost-78497994/\" type=\"external\">attempt to pack the court</a> in response to the Court's continuous rejection of his unconstitutional New Deal laws. That was seen as a considerable constitutional crisis where FDR intended to use the legislature to force his agenda down the throat of the judiciary.</p> \n\n<p>Third, Udall's stroke of \"genius\" only represents a final attempt to bring another judicial <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/commentary/2016/03/judge-merrick-garland-a-moderate-a-centrist-not-hardly\" type=\"external\">\"moderate\"</a> into the Supreme Court to undermine conservatives' hopes of putting additional originalists on the bench. Obama and the Democratic Party lost their privilege to nominate Supreme Court justices and federal judgeships the moment Donald Trump swore his oath to the Constitution on January 20, 2017.</p> \n\n<p>Fourth, and far more substantially, it justifies giving the President power to force the resignation of a Supreme Court justice in order to promulgate an agenda. It was an issue when FDR, Lyndon Johnson, or Richard Nixon attempted to do so during their respective presidencies and it should not be a normalized practice under Trump or any other administration. It is also a gross abuse of power for the executive to directly toy with the make-up of the judiciary to ensure that the Court may rule in his favor in the event of constitutional misconduct.</p> \n\n<p>Nevertheless, Udall believes that any \"true\" attempt to unite the country surrounds the nomination and the confirmation of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court even if it violates nearly 150 years of precedent and if it means undermining the will of the American people <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/poll-majority-of-americans-want-supreme-court-to-interpret-the-constitution-as-originally-written/article/2611261?custom_click=rss\" type=\"external\">who want to see more originalists on the Supreme Court</a>. Such pie-in-the-sky thinking completely ignores the laws of the land, undermines the judiciary, and presents itself as the last act of desperation of a party that refuses to accept that Obama is no longer the President of the United States.</p> \n\n<p>Politico also stipulated the following for Udall's radically moronic idea:</p> \n\n<p>Udall&#8217;s proposal also mirrors an episode from the fifth season of &#8220;The West Wing,&#8221; when staffers for fictional President Jed Bartlet &#8212; faced with a high court vacancy following the death of an associate justice &#8212; persuade the show&#8217;s chief justice to also resign so Bartlet could announce a pair of nominees who wouldn&#8217;t change the ideological balance of the court.</p> \n\n<p>As if anything that comes out of a fictional television show should act as basis for real-life policy.</p> \n\n<p>You cannot make this stuff up.</p> \n\n<p>Follow Elliott on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElliottRHams\" type=\"external\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ElliottRHams/\" type=\"external\">Facebook</a>.</p>", "title": "MORON ALERT: Senator Tom Udall Says Gorsuch And Garland Should Be Confirmed Simultaneously", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://dailywire.com/news/13922/moron-alert-senator-tom-udall-says-gorsuch-and-elliott-hamilton", "published_at": "2017-02-27", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>After the murderous assault on Dallas police officers on Thursday night in which five policemen were slain and six others wounded, Dallas Police Chief David Brown issued a brief, eloquent statement:</p> \n\n<p>Dallas Police Chief David Brown: <a href=\"https://t.co/gbG3UfPlGw\" type=\"external\">pic.twitter.com/gbG3UfPlGw</a></p> \n\n<p>Brown, who began his tenure as police chief in 2010, is no stranger to tragedy, as The Washington Post reports.

Earlier this month, the Census Bureau updated the public on changes it has made to improve the survey's results, and in that report, it included intriguing new insight into Americans' net worth. Specifically, U.S. households' median net worth reached $80,039 in 2013. Are you keeping pace?</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>The Census Bureau's estimate of household net worth comes from its 2014 survey, which reflects changes that more accurately show where net worth is coming from. The 2014 survey now includes questions on subjects such as annuities, passive business ownership, education savings accounts, and the cash value of life insurance. According to the Census Bureau, without including these new questions, the median net worth of households could have been reported to be as low as $74,083.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Getty Images.</p> \n\n<p>The biggest contributor to Americans' net worth is home equity. Overall, 63% of the survey's respondents say they have equity in their home, and the bureau reports that, across all respondents, equity represents about one-third of the median $80,039 in net worth.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>If you're a home owner, and you're curious how your equity compares to that of other homeowners, the median value of home equity that was reported was $81,000.</p> \n\n<p>A 401(k) plan or a thrift savings plan, a type of defined contribution plan that's offered to government employees, was the second-biggest contributor to U.S. household net worth. Overall, 40.7% of respondents say they have one of those plans, and that the median value of their account is $46,000.</p> \n\n<p>Individual retirement accounts and Keogh accounts are also popular, with 28% of people surveyed saying they have one, with a median balance of $40,000.</p> \n\n<p>Americans' assets also commonly include the cash value of a life insurance plan, and stocks or mutual funds. About 19% of people report a median $12,000 in cash value of life insurance, and 20% say they have a median $32,500 in stocks or mutual funds.</p> \n\n<p>Student loans and credit card debt were the biggest unsecured liabilities weighing down net worth. Mortgages and auto loans were included in the asset column, because on average, home and car owners reported having equity in them.</p> \n\n<p>More than half of households owe debt that is unsecured by collateral, and over 40% report owing money on credit cards and store bills. The median amount that's owed on credit cards is only $3,000, so student loans that are the biggest drag on U.S. net worth. Almost 20% of Americans owe a median $18,000 in student loans or other education-related debt.</p> \n\n<p>Americans' biggest assets are their home and retirement plans, so if you're on the fence about buying a home, or increasing your contribution rate to your 401(k) plan, those two moves could be your best options for increasing net worth over time.</p> \n\n<p>If you already own your home, making an additional mortgage payment every year can help you quickly build up home equity, and it can save you thousands of dollars in interest payments at the same time. A smart and budget-friendly way to increase your contributions to your 401(k) is to boost your contribution annually by the amount of your pay raise.</p> \n\n<p>On the liabilities side of your ledger, revolving credit card debt is a big no-no because credit card interest rates can be high, and money that's used to make monthly credit card payments can be better used if it's invested in your IRA.</p> \n\n<p>Overall, set reasonable goals for increasing your net worth, and check in annually on your progress toward those goals. Remember, however, that most of your net worth comes from homes and investments, and returns on those assets can vary widely in the short term, so make sure you set your goals with a long-term mindset.</p> \n\n<p>The $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

Road trips are one of those mysterious things families feel compelled to do but no one knows why, like camping in the Mojave Desert or supporting the career of Miley Cyrus. I predict in the end it won&#8217;t be gay marriage that brings about the destruction of the American family. It will be the road trip.</p> \n\n<p>After getting the kids settled into the back seat of our Honda Odyssey with their DVD players and movies, we hit the freeway. Once out of L.A., I was finally able to sit back, pop open my laptop, and begin jotting down a few ideas for this column. That&#8217;s when Kelly woke from his nap and grabbed the steering wheel from me, babbling some nonsense about &#8220;safety&#8221; and not using my computer while driving. So we switched seats.</p> \n\n<p>Relocated to the passenger side, &#8220;safely,&#8221; I narrowed my list of possible topics to two: &#8220;Surviving Your Child&#8217;s K-Mart Taste&#8221; and &#8220;Parents I Hate.&#8221; Then suddenly &#8212; at 70 miles per hour &#8212; the transmission on our car blew out. And a column was born.</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;m an American, a proud gay American who was raised to believe that bad things don&#8217;t happen to Hondas. Yet ours has blown two transmissions in five years.</p> \n\n<p>As we decelerated, the plume of smoke belching from underneath our hood began to panic my unflappable daughter. I tried to calm her as Kelly looked for a place to get off the road. &#8220;Think of it as an adventure, honey! We&#8217;re inside a fire-breathing dragon who just lost a leg!&#8221; She began to cry.</p> \n\n<p>Somehow we managed to limp across four lanes of traffic to the next exit and turn down a hill into the welcoming parking lot of a visitors center that overlooked a picturesque lake. A visitors center with bathrooms and vending machines and other kids to play with. A visitors center we soon noticed had a chain-link fence around it and a propped-up sign gloating, &#8220;Closed for Renovations.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Look, an abandoned castle!&#8221; I tried, failing.</p> \n\n<p>We called AAA Roadside Assistance and waited. Turkeys cook faster. An hour and 40 minutes passed as my iPod faded from Gaga to gone and the sun sank deep into the lake. The battery on our cell phone now dead, our world turned pitch black and eerie quiet.</p> \n\n<p>When our Triple-A savior finally arrived on the scene, I could have jumped for joy. Instead, I froze. The white knight who showed up for our rescue turned out to be a physical composite of every high school bully I ever suffered: a tattooed skinhead-type, complete with soul-deadening stare and missing front tooth.</p> \n\n<p>I hesitantly approached the massive flatbed tow truck idling before me and handed up my membership card through the cab window. Barely looking up, he grunted, &#8220;You know we only tow free for seven miles. After that it&#8217;s 10 bucks a mile. You got about 15 miles to the next town.&#8221; I asked if he could fit a family of four in his cab. His shrug said he&#8217;d manage.</p> \n\n<p>After finishing his paperwork in silence, he finally lumbered down from his cab and stopped, getting his first, long look at my family. He stared at Kelly, then at me, then at our kids, finally speaking in the slow, guttural tones of a wife beater:</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;These kids y&#8217;all&#8217;s?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>We answered that yes, they were.</p> \n\n<p>Traveling as a two-dad family can have its challenges. Twice a year we visit my parents in South Carolina, a state so welcoming that its constitution bans not only same-sex marriage and civil unions but birth control and bagels. On its face, California might seem an improvement, until you find yourself stranded in the dark off I-5 in one of those counties where Prop 8 passed with 98 percent of the vote.</p> \n\n<p>This man, whom I had now cast as the bastard love child of Ned Beatty and his horny hillbilly in the sequel to Deliverance, stared at us for what seemed a heart-thumping forever. Then he moved off. He spent the next few minutes hauling out huge, heavy chains with giant metal hooks. In my mind I pictured him encircling them around Kelly and me after he&#8217;d shot us, to more easily sink us to the bottom of that all-too-convenient lake.</p> \n\n<p>After attaching the giant hooks to our Odyssey &#8212; of course, to complete our family portrait and ensure our suspect status, we were two men driving a minivan &#8212; he moved to the side of his flatbed and began pulling mysterious levers that caused his vehicle to groan as it slowly tipped its flatbed to meet our homosexual automobile.</p> \n\n<p>This was too much for our youngest, James, a boy so Bam-Bam butch that for years we&#8217;ve referred to him as God&#8217;s joke on the gay daddies. By now he truly was jacked up by the adventure of it all. Biologically drawn to the smell of metal and grease like a moth to a blowtorch, James pushed forward and started peppering our AAA guy with questions: &#8220;Is our car dead?&#8221; &#8220;Do you have a bathroom in your truck?&#8221; &#8220;Who knocked out your tooth? Was it Batman?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>At this point Kelly intervened: &#8220;James, stay back so he can do his work.&#8221; Mr. Triple-A stopped what he was doing and looked at us. &#8220;His name&#8217;s James? I got a boy named James.&#8221; He had six kids, he informed us, all named after famous people in the Bible. Of course you do, I thought. A home movie began unspooling in my mind, starring a toddler Moses and barefoot Bathsheba helping their brother Goliath blow up frogs by sticking firecrackers up their butts.</p> \n\n<p>Then he did something unexpected, something&#8230; perfect. This man whose menacing silence and sidelong glances had me rattled took off his work gloves and asked James to hold out his hands. He then began to gently pull the huge, oil-stained gloves over our son&#8217;s tiny fingers. Next he asked if James wanted to help him work the levers on the side of the flatbed so that he could haul our minivan up onto the truck. Mute with awe, James could only nod. As the chains grew taut and our car began to make its slow ascent up the ramp, James&#8217; eyes widened to the size of the moon that had finally peeked through the clouds overhead.</p> \n\n<p>Before long we were all crowded into the cab of the tow truck for the ride to the nearest town. I never would have thought it possible, but somehow the five of us fit. My family was safe. Jesse &#8212; he had a Biblical name, too &#8212; pulled out his phone and handed it to us so we could see pictures of his family. As the glow from the faces of his wife and kids lit up the inside of the truck, he looked at Kelly and me and said, &#8220;So&#8230; did you guys get married when y&#8217;all had that little window a few years back, before the Prop 8 thing?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>We said that we did. &#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My mom did, too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She called up me and my brother and sister and told us, &#8216;Me and Maggie&#8217;s gonna have a wedding. You got a week and a half to figure out a way to get here.&#8217;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>From there on out, this man I was so sure I had pegged continued to upend my preconceived notions. When he learned we live in Hollywood, he told us that as a teenager he&#8217;d been bused in from the suburbs, commuting 20 hours a week to attend the Hollywood High magnet program in theater arts. Theater arts?</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Yep, it was great. For P.E. we took dance. Spent English readin&#8217; Shakespeare. Instead of shop, we built sets for musicals. I loved it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He never charged us the $80 he should have for the extra mileage. Instead, he directed us to the one motel in that truck-stop town that had a swimming pool for the kids. Then he advised us which mechanic to see the next morning and which taco stands to avoid. And before lowering our big, gay minivan into the parking lot of the auto shop, he stopped to put his gloves on our daughter so she could work the levers this time, sending her into a spiral of rapture. After that he offered to drive us to our motel.</p> \n\n<p>After we&#8217;d said our goodbyes and settled into our room, we made sure to sit the kids down and tell them how lucky our family had been that Jesse was the one sent to help us. Being kids, they got it: somehow the five of us fit.</p> \n\n<p>After Kelly and the kids fell asleep, I got curious and Googled the name Jesse. Turns out it&#8217;s Hebrew for &#8220;God&#8217;s gift.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Spilled Milk chronicles Bill&#8217;s misadventures in Daddyland.

What law had it existed at the time would have prevented this mass killing or another mass killing. What law, but for its lack of implementation could have prevented this. That&#8217;s one question.

This means that construction in the 149 existing Israeli settlements throughout the West Bank that are strangling Palestinians, including the settlements on our village&#8217;s land, will continue unchecked. Olmert&#8217;s cynical announcement underlines our fear that Israel, with US support, will insist on retaining most West Bank settlements in the upcoming negotiations, locking Palestinians into a &#8220;separate but unequal&#8221; position.</p> \n\n<p>When United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice&#8217;s visited the Middle East a few weeks ago, people from our small village of Bil&#8217;in joined neighboring villages to send her a message. We protested peacefully against a West Bank highway near us that is reserved for Jewish Israeli settlers, and off-limits to Palestinians, though it was built on Palestinian land. Our banner read: &#8220;Condi, What would Rosa Parks do?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>We know that Dr. Rice experienced the bitter taste of discrimination growing up in the South during the US civil rights struggle. In Bil&#8217;in, we&#8217;ve drawn inspiration from the US civil rights movement as we&#8217;ve carried out a three year nonviolent resistance campaign against the discriminatory policies of Israel&#8217;s military occupation.</p> \n\n<p>We share Dr. Rice&#8217;s admiration for the courage of Rosa Parks who was arrested in Alabama, Rice&#8217;s home state, for refusing to give her bus seat to a white man. As Palestinians we aren&#8217;t even allowed in buses on many roads in our own country, because 200 miles of the best West Bank roads are reserved for Israeli Jewish settlers.1 The color of Palestinian license plates is different from the licenses of Israelis. Palestinian plates are not allowed on most of the highways crisscrossing the West Bank, many of which were built with US government funding. Palestinians have been banned for five years now from Highway 443 where we protested.</p> \n\n<p>According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), there are 561 physical obstacles and checkpoints inside the West Bank restricting Palestinian movement within the West Bank2, in comparison with only eight checkpoints which separate the West Bank from Israel proper. Nearly all the obstacles and checkpoints are located along the West Bank roads reserved for Israelis. This makes getting to the hospital, school and work or visiting relatives painstakingly difficult or impossible for us. This fragmentation of the West Bank has devastated our economy.</p> \n\n<p>For Palestinians, accepting a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on just 22% of our historic homeland was already a dramatic compromise. But President Bush promised Israel in 2004 that in any negotiated agreement with the Palestinians Israel would retain its &#8220;already existing major population centers&#8221; in the West Bank.</p> \n\n<p>However, all Israeli settlements are illegal under international law. By annexing to Israel strategically located clusters of settlements, or &#8220;settlement blocs&#8221;, and their highways which carve Palestinian areas into isolated enclaves, Israel will gain permanent control of our movement, borders, water, and cut us off from Jerusalem.</p> \n\n<p>The Israeli organization Peace Now reported a few weeks ago that the population growth rate in the settlements is three times the growth rate within Israel.3 We&#8217;re experiencing such rapid settlement construction around Bil&#8217;in and throughout the West Bank that I can&#8217;t even find an accurate map of the West Bank for my son.</p> \n\n<p>In 2001, Israeli developers began building settlement homes on land seized from Bil&#8217;in, calling them a neighborhood of the Modi&#8217;in Illit settlement bloc. Four years later, Israel&#8217;s segregation wall separated Bil&#8217;in from 50% of our agricultural land under the pretext of protecting this new settlement. In response, we held over 200 nonviolent protests together with Israeli and international supporters.</p> \n\n<p>Hundreds of us were injured and arrested. After our protests, Israel&#8217;s Supreme Court ruled that the wall&#8217;s route in Bil&#8217;in must be changed to return around half of our seized land. Though we celebrated this success, Israel continues to build on our land that wasn&#8217;t returned and plans to annex it as part of the Modi&#8217;in Illit settlement bloc.4</p> \n\n<p>Israel has already de facto annexed the 10.2% of the West Bank that lies between the Green Line and the segregation wall, including the major settlement blocs and 80% of Israel&#8217;s 450,000 settlers. The segregation wall, settlements and settlement roads carve Palestinian areas into isolated enclaves.</p> \n\n<p>We pray that our children will not spend their lives under Israeli military occupation. We hope that the Annapolis meeting will bring our dreams of freedom closer to fulfillment. But we are concerned that if Israel is allowed to keep most of its settlements and the roads that connect them, then the existing system of &#8220;separate but unequal&#8221; will be cemented in place in a Palestinian state.</p> \n\n<p>MOHAMMED KHATIB is a leading member of Bilin&#8217;s Popular Committee Against the Wall and the secretary of its village council.</p> \n\n<p>[1] <a href=\"http://imeu.net/engine/uploads/forbidden_roads_-_israels_discriminatory_road_regime_in_the_west_bank.pdf\" type=\"external\">Forbidden roads: The discriminatory West Bank road regime</a>, B&#8217;Tselem.

It's surprising, therefore, to learn that roughly 1 million taxpayers are set to forgo refunds from the 2013 tax year. According to a March 1 statement, the Internal Revenue Service is sitting on as much as $1 billion in total refunds for unfiled 2013 returns. If you're among the million Americans who stand to collect, now's the time to get that old return in -- before it's too late.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Generally speaking, you're supposed to file a tax return each year in time for the deadline, which, for 2017, is April 18. (Yes, you get a few extra days this year.) That said, you technically have a three-year window to claim a refund, which means that if you've yet to file your 2013 return, you still have over a month to do so. Once that April 18 deadline passes, however, you'll no longer have an opportunity to get at that money, at which point it will go straight to the U.S. Treasury instead.</p> \n\n<p>IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.</p> \n\n<p>All in, the IRS says it could owe up to $1 billion in total refunds for the 2013 tax year. Though the median estimated refund varies by state, it ranges from $619 in Idaho to $917 in Alaska. (Note that these figures apply to federal, not state, refunds.)</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Now if you're worried that filing your 2013 tax return three years late will result in a penalty that wipes out any potential refund and then some, fear not. There's no penalty for filing a return after the deadline if the IRS owes you money. Rather, it's the opposite situation you need to worry about.</p> \n\n<p>If you owe the IRS money and are late filing your return, you could face a penalty equal to 5% of the taxes you owe for every month your return is late, up to a maximum of 25%. And if you owe money and file your return more than 60 days after the deadline, you'll face a minimum penalty of $135 or 100% of your unpaid tax bill, whichever is smaller. But again, if you're the one who's owed money, you won't be penalized for getting your return in late.</p> \n\n<p>Now keep in mind that if you've also yet to file your 2014 and 2015 returns, your 2013 tax refund may be withheld by the IRS until you get those forms in. Additionally, if you're due a refund from 2013 but owe the IRS money from another tax year, that 2013 refund will first be applied to whatever balance you have outstanding. The same holds true if you're delinquent on a federal student loan or child support payment -- you won't get that money in hand, but instead, it will be used to offset your obligations. But if it's just that 2013 return you neglected to file and you are due a refund, you should have no problems collecting your money in full.</p> \n\n<p>Failing to file a tax return at any time could mean losing out on a pretty sizable refund, and this especially holds true if you're a lower earner. Each year, an estimated 20% of eligible filers miss out on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which this year could be worth up to $6,318 depending on your earnings and the number of qualifying children in your household.</p> \n\n<p>Back in 2013, the EITC was worth as much as $6,044, and the income thresholds to qualify were as follows:</p> \n\n<p>DATA SOURCE: IRS.</p> \n\n<p>Note that these limits have since increased, which means that if you currently earn slightly more than what you're seeing above, you may still qualify for the 2016 tax year.</p> \n\n<p>If you're among the many Americans who failed to submit a 2013 return (or a 2014 or 2015 return, for that matter), you should know that it isn't too late to file those forms and get your hands on some much-needed cash. It's a far better alternative than donating that money to the U.S. Treasury and permanently kissing it goodbye.</p> \n\n<p>The $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

Look no further than the document above, a letter from Earhart to her future husband George Putnam.</p> \n\n<p>You&#8217;ll remember Earhart became famous as the first female aviator to fly a solo transatlantic flight, redefining expectations of women along the way. Then, she tragically disappeared during a flight in 1937 (only to reappear in a <a href=\"http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/movies/23amelia.html?_r=0\" type=\"external\">&#8220;carefully scrubbed&#8221;</a> <a href=\"http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/movies/23amelia.html?_r=0\" type=\"external\">and &#8220;exasperatingly dull&#8221; movie</a> in which she was played by Hilary Swank, but that&#8217;s for another post).</p> \n\n<p>Of course, we love her anyway for her courage and fierceness, and even moreso having stumbled upon this priceless prenup agreement. Reading through the document, one thing becomes very clear: this woman had a clear sense of what she wanted out of a marriage. And I find much of her marital vision compelling, even today.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Earhart first expresses some trepidation about getting married at all (&#8220;You must know again my reluctance to marry&#8230;&#8221;) for fear of derailing her career, which &#8220;means most&#8221; to her. Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but this kind of agonizing over work-life balance sounds like a <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-cant-have-it-all/309020/\" type=\"external\">distinctly familiar dilemma</a> to the modern feminist. Earhart goes on to give the rough outline of an open marriage (&#8220;I shall not hold you to any midaeval [sic] code of faithfulness&#8221; and emphasizes rather than monogamy a goal of &#8220;finding happiness together&#8221;, on which she finds the marriage to be contingent.</p> \n\n<p>Surely there are a lot of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/24/feminist-wedding-jessica-valenti\" type=\"external\">modern day feminists</a> who can relate to Earhart&#8217;s sentiments about marriage. But while her vision is forward-thinking, the well-reasoned perspective laid out in these papers is strangely reassuring to me, in that it&#8217;s a good reminder that ours is hardly the first, second, or even third generation to struggle to define what it means to be an independent, feminist, and successful while also being a loving and supportive partner and perhaps spouse.</p> \n\n<p>For those who are wondering if this little piece of history could be too good to be true, I share and respect your internet skepticism.

Most Americans are insured either through the government or through their employer. The individual market is where everyone else purchases health insurance, and does so on their own. And this is the market most affected (and decimated) by ObamaCare.</p> \n\n<p>On and off, throughout the last 15 years, it has been through the individual market that I have purchased my own health coverage. This means that I am quite familiar with the damage ObamaCare has done to those stuck in this market, most of whom are not poor enough for Medicaid -- which means they come from the working and middle class. Boiled down, ObamaCare has become a cruel tax on working people, who are now forced by their government to pay an enormous sum of money for what is now a nearly useless product.</p> \n\n<p>Prior to ObamaCare the individual market was far from perfect. You could be denied coverage for any number of reasons, including a pre-existing condition. I was once denied coverage for refusing to take a prescription drug with flu-like side effects.</p> \n\n<p>Even before ObamaCare, one of the individual market's biggest setbacks was a lack of competition. Because our government is corrupt, insurers were and are still not allowed to sell their product across state lines (Trump wants to remedy this, God bless him). This dramatically shrinks the market to within the individual state, which in turn means less competition for insurers, which in turn means higher prices and an increased amount of dickish corporate behavior.</p> \n\n<p>Nevertheless, despite its wild imperfections, I was always able to purchase coverage at a reasonable price. Other than a bad lower back, for a 50 year-old guy I'm in good health. For this reason, I would always purchase what was called a \"catastrophic plan\" -- a policy with a $6000 to $10,000 deductible for anywhere from $150 to $225 a month.</p> \n\n<p>Catastrophic plans were not just good for me personally, they were good for the entire health care system. What you had were millions of people insured in case of a dire health emergency, like a car crash or cancer, but otherwise doing something no one else does: treating the healthcare industry like a free market.</p> \n\n<p>Somewhere around 90% of insured Americans do NOT treat the health care industry like a free market. Because someone else is paying for their health services (an insurance company), no one prices anything. Therefore, unlike every other product and service in America, health care providers are not under any pressure from customers when it comes to cost.</p> \n\n<p>The perfect example of this is to look at the respective cost curves of medical procedures that are and are not covered by insurance. It is no secret that overall health care costs have exploded, and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/06/21/health-care-rising-costs/\" type=\"external\">done so well ahead of inflation</a> (this is another broken ObamaCare promise). And yet, like plasma televisions and Bluray players, the cost of medical procedures not covered by insurance, like Lasik and plastic surgeries, have decreased. I can also tell you from personal experience that eye exams and glasses are much cheaper than they used to be. My annual flu shot, which is now available at the local CVS or Walgreens, is a mere $25, or about 1/10th of what a doctor visit for a flu shot would cost your insurance company.</p> \n\n<p>Once you are outside of the insurance market, you also discover that even insured services are cheaper. Since I now pay everything out of pocket, everything is cheaper. My doctors charge much less for visits and my prescriptions are actually cheaper than what my co-pay cost when I was insured. I once called around pricing an MRI, something an insured person would never do, and the prices ranged from $2500 to $400. Guess who got my business.</p> \n\n<p>At the risk of putting too fine a point on this, imagine the cost of a brake job or oil change if we insured our car repairs like we do our health. The whole idea of health insurance, outside of a catastrophic illness, is not only stupid, it's exploding costs.</p> \n\n<p>And what did ObamaCare do? It outlawed these wonderful catastrophic plans. I'm not sure how such an act is Constitutional in a free country, but that's for another column. What I do know is that rather than enjoying access to tailor-made insurance plans, every American is now required to purchase a comprehensive plan. Under ObamaCare, although I am a 50 year-old male, I must pay <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2014/03/13/obamacare-charges-millions-of-unsuspecting-americans-for-coverage-theyll-never-use/#7bbb1a95173c\" type=\"external\">for pre-natal care, maternity care, etc.</a></p> \n\n<p>The best comparison to drive home how absurdly ridiculous this is, is to have you imagine the government passing a law that requires everyone to purchase, not just a car, but a Cadillac.</p> \n\n<p>Now that the backfill is complete, let me explain my headline. Here is how ObamaCare is nothing more than a cruel tax on the working and middle class.</p> \n\n<p>Tax #1 - Health care costs have increased dramatically for everyone</p> \n\n<p>Thanks to the failure of ObamaCare, the cost of everyone's healthcare is exploding. Everyone. Not just those in the individual market. If you recall, President LiarMcFailure and his fact-checking media promised us health care costs would decrease by $2500 a year under ObamaCare. The reality is that, in many cases, costs have actually increased by that much. That's a tax.</p> \n\n<p>ObamaCare defenders will argue that costs were increasing prior to ObamaCare, which is true. But not by this much.</p> \n\n<p>Tax #2 - ObamaCare premium explosion</p> \n\n<p>Even before the newest rate increases of around 20% go into <a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article80879447.html\" type=\"external\">effect next year</a>, the cost of my monthly premiums more than doubled to $450 a month. What's especially maddening is that the deductible is still an obnoxiously high $4000 - $5000.</p> \n\n<p>What this means, essentially, is that I'm paying for a Cadillac health insurance plan that I'll never use.</p> \n\n<p>That's a tax -- a huge tax, a massive tax.</p> \n\n<p>Granted, I never used the catastrophic plan, but that premium was much lower and I was not mandated by our corrupt government to purchase it.</p> \n\n<p>ObamaCare defenders will argue that, thanks to government subsidies, many ObamaCare recipients won't pay a price increase. So what? Taxpayers still have to pay for the subsidy.</p> \n\n<p>Tax #3 - You're paying more for an increasingly awful service</p> \n\n<p>Even with that obnoxious restriction that wouldn&#8217;t allow insurance companies to sell across state lines, each state still had a number of companies to choose from. But now that ObamaCare is decimating the individual marketplace, insurance companies are fleeing the individual market, which means that companies you once could purchase insurance from prior to ObamCare, you no longer can. The government has chased them completely out of business.</p> \n\n<p>In most every state, the number of providers is shrinking, your choices as a consumer are decreasing by the year. In the entire state of New Jersey, you have only two insurance companies to choose from.</p> \n\n<p>Tax #4 - The ObamaCare penalty</p> \n\n<p>You're a freeborn American. You look at the choices offered by ObamaCare. You decide that paying $5000 a year for a lousy policy you will never use is madness. You choose not to purchase health insurance and instead choose to pay out of your own pocket for whatever medical needs you and your family might need.</p> \n\n<p>Too bad.</p> \n\n<p>That choice is now outlawed.</p> \n\n<p>If you make that choice, you will be taxed 2.5% of your annual income.</p> \n\n<p>Tax #5 - The deficit</p> \n\n<p>The ObamaCare boondoggle is costing taxpayers tens <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/10/17/now-there-can-be-no-doubt-obamacare-will-increase-the-deficit/#6bfb062953d1\" type=\"external\">of millions of dollars</a> a year in deficit spending. Because the Boomers and their spawn are too selfish to live within their means, their bill will be paid for by our children and grandchildren.</p> \n\n<p>That's a tax.</p> \n\n<p>--</p> \n\n<p>Fewer choices. A worse product. Double the cost.</p> \n\n<p>Those of us opposed to ObamaCare warned of this in advance, and for our trouble the mainstream media labeled us racist.</p> \n\n<p>P.S.

One of the most notable examples is the fact that Tillerson allegedly referred to Trump as a &#8220;moron.&#8221; Trump has, of course, denied this ever happened along with the rumors that Tillerson planned on resigning.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Featured image via <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com/license/857516688\" type=\"external\">Getty Images.</a></p>", "title": "Trump Once Complained To Tillerson About Laws Restricting U.S. From Taking Bribes", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://bipartisanreport.com/2017/10/06/trump-once-complained-to-tillerson-about-laws-restricting-u-s-from-taking-bribes/", "published_at": "2017-10-06", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\" />Patrick Henningsen <a href=\"http://wp.me/p3bwni-5UR\" type=\"external\">21st Century Wire</a></p> \n\n<p>Cults and technocracies go together it seems, like peanuts and beer.</p> \n\n<p>No matter what is happening in the real world, zealots and mandarins still carry on, filing their green reports, making incredible claims &#8211; in a fit of religious intoxication, in a never-ending compulsive melodrama.&amp;#160;It would be a funny thing, if it weren&#8217;t so darn expensive.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>In the United States, a &#8216;polar vortex&#8217; has swooped into the Midwest, bringing with it a record freeze.

Millions of Americans have been forced into virtual hibernation as a result of the latest arctic wave, which is now pushing its way from Midwest states like Minnesota, down to the south and over to the east coast. It is so cold that skin exposure to sub-zero elements can result in instant frostbite.

That is because the CO2 &#8216;greenhouse effect&#8217; is weak and marginal compared to natural cause of global temperature changes.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>What about the melting polar ice caps? Well,&amp;#160;US space agency NASA has just announced that sea ice around Antarctica (South Pole) has surpassed &#8203;&#8203;19.47 million square meters as of September &#8211; the highest since measurements began in 1979.</p> \n\n<p>How about the North Pole?

It does not matter if this common enemy is &#8220;a real one or&#8230; one invented for the purpose.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Here was a neatly packaged ideology ready just in time for the UN&#8217;s 1992 Earth Summit in&amp;#160;Rio de Janeiro.</p> \n\n<p>People should consider the ridiculousness &#8211; and complete waste of state money and resources, of still maintaining whole government departments of Climate Change, staffed by &#8216;Climate Bosses&#8217;, working to implement more &#8216;Climate Policy&#8217; and &#8216;Climate Legislation&#8217;. This incredible charade is costing us billions, if not trillions.</p> \n\n<p>Sure, it&#8217;s beyond a joke when you look at it all through the lense of reality, but it&#8217;s important to understand the context in which this climate drive was put in motion. Aside from the failed <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Carbon Trading markets</a>, it was a well-placed distraction at a specific place in time especially in the United States, Australia and Great Britain. Look at the timing of the climate movement which went mainstream in 2003-2005.&amp;#160;By tying up millions of &#8216;green&#8217; activists and controlled opposition organisations like Greenpeace, all three of those governments were able to aid industry in making substantial headway in the&amp;#160;hydraulic fracturing shale gas, or &#8216;Fracking&#8217; industry &#8211; in a quiet takeover of large areas of rural land and with little or no public resistance. By the time activists copped on, plans were already too far down the road and all the relevant civil servants, politicians and journalists were already bought and paid for. City fat cats and multinational energy consortiums have been laughing ever since.</p> \n\n<p>No Greenpeace ships circling Japan over the Fukushima disaster either.

The nights when they light up the sky are the same nights she, and other medical staff, can&#8217;t leave the clinic for helping people with inhalers, nebulizers, steroids and antibiotics.</p> \n\n<p>The chemicals used in oil and gas extraction, it seems, can irritate the lungs and cause <a href=\"http://www.earthworksaction.org/Chemicalsandhealth.cfm\" type=\"external\">a bunch of other nasty health problems, too.</a></p> \n\n<p>The other thing about drilling: It&#8217;s really noisy. Booms as loud as a jet takeoff have scared Nuiqsut&#8217;s whales and caribou off, so along with their health, local people are losing their livelihood.</p> \n\n<p>The Canadian government is currently trying to ignore an offshore-drilling moratorium enacted 34 years ago.

These two headlines were enough to send the global markets into a small sell-off Friday. Here are a few stocks making major moves or headlines this week.</p> \n\n<p>Restoration Hardware Holdings, Inc.'s investors were hit hard as the stock got pummeled this week, declining more than 20% after it posted another disappointing earnings report. While the first quarter is seasonally slow for the company, its surprise loss of $0.05 per share fell short of analysts' expectations of $0.05 per-share profit. Worse yet, it was a large decline when compared to last year's first-quarter result of $0.23 per share.</p> \n\n<p>In addition to earnings checking in lower than expected, revenue increased 8%, with comparable sales moving 4% higher. This generally would be a silver lining for investors, but the expectations for those metrics were higher, as well. Management was quick to point to headwinds caused by the negative impact of energy and currency on the markets, but also internal issues with supply-chain problems.</p> \n\n<p>All in all, the disappointing quarter led management to reduce its full-year EPS guidance by $0.90 to $1.00, down to a full-year total EPS of between $1.60 and $1.80. This is below analysts' estimates of $2.66.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Restoration Hardware's stock price has dropped 66% in 2016 alone, and value investors looking to swoop in should weigh the risks and rewards. The company has major strategies hanging in the wind, such as launching RH Modern, and moving from a promotional to a membership-selling model using the RH Grey Card.</p> \n\n<p>On the flip side, investors inLDR Holding Corp. are having a fantastic week after the medical-device company, which focuses on treatment of spinal disorders, announced that it's being acquired by Zimmer Biomet Holdings .Looking at the details, Zimmer Biomet put a $1 billion offer on the table to acquire LDR in an all-cash deal. That offer values the shares at $37 each, which was a hefty premium to the stock's closing price on Monday -- hence, the 67% jump for the week.</p> \n\n<p>\"This highly strategic and complementary transaction will enhance Zimmer Biomet's innovation leadership in musculoskeletal healthcare by adding a premier spine platform to our portfolio of solutions,\" said Zimmer Biomet CEO David Dvorak, in a press release.</p> \n\n<p>The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016, and Zimmer Biomet expects the acquisition to accelerate the future growth of its total business. Management will update its revenue guidance to reflect the acquisition when the deal closes. While the revenue will be adjusted, investors should temper expectations for incremental earnings per share from the deal -- at least for this year -- as it's expected to be neutral to the bottom line this year, and accretive to EPS in 2017 and thereafter.</p> \n\n<p>Lastly, making headlines late in the trading week was Tesla Motors , and not for good reasons.The Daily Kanban <a href=\"http://dailykanban.com/2016/06/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/\" type=\"external\">broke the news Opens a New Window.</a>, and reported that, in three instances, Tesla owners were at least asked by Tesla to sign \"goodwill agreements,\" often in return for covering out-of-warranty repair costs on some vehicles.

Image source: Tesla Motors.</p> \n\n<p>\"The agency immediately informed Tesla that any language implying that consumers should not contact the agency regarding safety concerns is unacceptable, and NHTSA expects Tesla to eliminate any such language,\" said NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas, according to Automotive News.Tesla <a href=\"https://www.teslamotors.com/blog/grain-of-salt\" type=\"external\">responded late Opens a New Window.</a> Thursday, giving its side of the situation.</p> \n\n<p>\"There is no safety defect with the suspensions in either the Model S or Model X,\" the company said in a blog post. \"On rare occasions when repairs are discounted or conducted for free, customers are asked to sign a \"goodwill agreement,\" Tesla's response continued. \"The basic point is to ensure that Tesla doesn't do a good deed, only to have that used against us in court for further gain.\"</p> \n\n<p>On one hand, an agreement such as this is uncommon in the automotive industry, and rumors of a potential cover-up have fired up across the Internet -- which should initially be taken with a grain of salt in these situations.

However, there are many approaches a company can take when delivering employee feedback. One&amp;#160;growing option is&amp;#160;360-degree feedback.</p> \n\n<p>When you first hear the term \" <a href=\"http://engagiant.com/blog/the-importance-of-continuous-feedback-in-change-management/\" type=\"external\">360-degree feedback Opens a New Window.</a>,\" you may feel&amp;#160;overwhelmed. It can be a lot of information to handle, and it may sound complicated. Getting your employees used to a 360-degree review process may also take a little effort, but it will ultimately be worth it.</p> \n\n<p>Here are the basics when it comes to&amp;#160;360-degree feedback success:</p> \n\n<p>Understanding 360-Degree Feedback</p> \n\n<p>When it comes down to it, 360-degree feedback is exactly what it sounds like &#8211; feedback from around the circle. It is a system or process in which an employee&amp;#160;receives feedback from multiple sources. These sources are typically colleagues, direct reports, and managers. A&amp;#160;360-degree review will often also include some form of self-evaluation. The goal of this process is to allow the entire team to help each other develop skills and address any potential weaknesses.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>There are multiple&amp;#160;benefits when transitioning to a 360-degree feedback system,&amp;#160;including the following:</p> \n\n<p>1. Open Channels Of Communication</p> \n\n<p>Adopting the 360-degree feedback system allows employees in the company to comment on each other's work. This fosters a communication-rich environment in which it is easy to address and resolve problems.</p> \n\n<p>The overall communication process is improved, and issues that could potentially cause problems are often solved before they cause any damage. Effective communication makes an organization&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.roomtoescape.com/blog/12-statistics-that-show-the-importance-of-effective-corporate-team-building\" type=\"external\">4.5 times more likely Opens a New Window.</a> to retain its&amp;#160;best employees.</p> \n\n<p>2. Better Feedback From Multiple Sources</p> \n\n<p>Receiving feedback from peers, supervisors, and oneself allows for a more well-rounded and substantial review compared to a process that relies on feedback from just one individual. Employees are able to receive feedback more frequently, and peer feedback is just as beneficial as feedback received from superiors. In fact,&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.trakstar.com/blog-post/7-facts-you-need-to-know-before-giving-employee-feedback/\" type=\"external\">88 percent of employees who receive peer feedback are happier with their jobs Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>A 360-degree&amp;#160;review also allows trends and patterns to become clear. For example, let's say an employee is always looking for different ways to help other departments and collaborate. While a supervisor might not have seen any&amp;#160;of this, colleagues from these departments would be able to praise the employee for their hard work. In this case, a 360-degree feedback process allows team members to recognize good work that may have otherwise gone unnoticed.</p> \n\n<p>3. Team Development</p> \n\n<p>The 360-degree feedback approach helps team members work more effectively together. Team members who give each other feedback create a sense of accountability when providing their input on each member's performance. A well-implemented 360-degree system can allow for improved team communication and development. Team communication is important, with <a href=\"http://govitru.com/workplace-statistics/\" type=\"external\">33 percent of employees Opens a New Window.</a> saying a lack of open, honest communication has the most negative impact on employee morale.</p> \n\n<p>4. Career Development</p> \n\n<p>A 360-degree feedback process provides employees with excellent information about what they&amp;#160;need to do in order to further their careers. It also keeps them engaged in their current roles: <a href=\"http://www.businessperform.com/blog/2010/10/05/gallup-employee-feedback-358.html\" type=\"external\">98 percent of employees Opens a New Window.</a> say managers who give them little or no feedback fail to engage them. A 360-degree process gives an employee many opportunities to&amp;#160;learn what they are doing well and how they could improve.</p> \n\n<p>What Are the Downsides of a&amp;#160;360-Degree Review?</p> \n\n<p>For all the benefits, a 360-degree review process also has its downsides. It is important to understand these shortfalls because they can offer us a map of what to avoid when practicing 360-degree reviews.</p> \n\n<p>1. What an Employee Decides to Do After the Process</p> \n\n<p>In order for the 360-degree review process to be successful, an employee must be able to do a few things along the way. It can be overwhelming to receive large amounts of feedback all at once. If the information is to be useful, an employee must be able to understand the feedback, process it, and determine next steps.</p> \n\n<p>Taking a <a href=\"https://engagiant.com/blog/microfeedback-beyond-technology/\" type=\"external\">microfeedback Opens a New Window.</a> approach might be able to help here. Integrating this process into a complete performance management system makes employees accountable for following up and acting on the feedback provided by others.</p> \n\n<p>2. Focusing on What Is Wrong</p> \n\n<p>People tend to focus on the negative remarks rather than the positive during performance reviews. That means many employees focus on fixing their weaknesses. While it is important to address performance shortfalls, employees should also pay attention to the positive aspects of their reviews. Maximizing one's strengths has been shown to be rewarding, and it will certainly advance your team in the right direction.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.clearcompany.com/ignore-these-performance-management-stats-at-your-own-risk\" type=\"external\">A reported 25 percent of employees Opens a New Window.</a> leave organizations due to lack of recognition. Try to emphasize the positives while giving feedback in the 360-degree review process. (Make sure to address weaknesses as well!) Encouraging employees to pursue their strengths will help counteract negative feelings.</p> \n\n<p>3. Sticking to the Process</p> \n\n<p>A 360-degree review is not a one-time event. This process should be implemented on a regular basis. Building a strong feedback culture can help when implementing 360-degree reviews.</p> \n\n<p>Try to make feedback a daily habit.

Perry, the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of California&#8217;s anti-gay marriage initiative, Proposition 8. Faith-based groups were on prominent display: the Methodists supporting marriage equality, the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Westboro Baptists</a> suggesting (per usual) that &#8220;God hates fags,&#8221; the Catholics both for and against gay marriage, clergy of all stripes. But one group that wasn&#8217;t there in any official capacity was the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&#8212;a.k.a. the Mormons&#8212;which perhaps more than any other religious group was responsible for getting Prop. 8 passed in the first place.</p> \n\n<p>In the five years since the LDS church sent busloads of the faithful to California to canvass neighborhoods, and contributed more than $20 million via its members to support the initiative, it has all but dropped the rope in the public policy tug of war over marriage equality. The change stems from an even more remarkable if somewhat invisible transformation happening within the church, prompted by the ugly fight over Prop. 8 and the ensuing backlash from the flock.</p> \n\n<p>Although the LDS&#8217;s prophet hasn&#8217;t described a holy revelation directing a revision in church doctrine on same-sex marriage or gay rights in general, the church has shown a rare capacity for introspection and humane cultural change unusual for a large conservative religious organization.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It seems like the [Mormon] hierarchy has pulled the plug and is no longer taking the lead in the fight to stop same-sex marriage,&#8221; says <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Fred Karger</a>, the LGBT activist who first exposed the church&#8217;s major role in the passage of Prop. 8. &#8220;The Mormon Church has lost so many members and suffered such a black eye because of all its anti-gay activities that they really had no choice. I am hopeful that the Catholic Church cannot be far behind.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The LDS church has been a driving force against gay-marriage initiatives since at least 1995. It was instrumental in fending off same-sex marriage in Hawaii and Alaska and, in 2000, it helped pass California&#8217;s Proposition 22 (the Prop. 8 precursor known as the Knight Initiative), which defined marriage as solely between a man and woman. (Prop. 22 was struck down by the California Supreme Court in 2008.)</p> \n\n<p>The church&#8217;s anti-gay positions and lobbying on gay marriage have always been divisive. In 2000, during the fight over the Knight Initiative, a young gay Mormon named Stuart Matis killed himself on the steps of a Mormon ward in Los Altos, California. In a letter to his cousin shortly before his suicide, he despaired over the impact of the church&#8217;s political activities on Mormon families: &#8220;On the night of March 7th, many California couples will retire to their beds thrilled that they helped pass the Knight Initiative. What they don&#8217;t realize is that in the next room, their son or daughter is lying in bed crying and could very well one day be the victim of society&#8217;s homophobia. The Knight Initiative will certainly save no family. It is codified hatred. It is anti-family, anti-love and it is wrong.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But Matis&#8217; death didn&#8217;t slow the church&#8217;s efforts to beat back same-sex marriage initiatives. In 2008, after the California Supreme Court briefly legalized gay marriage in the state, the Latter Day Saints lent their formidable organizing skills and networks to the Prop. 8 effort, sending canvassers door to door by zip code&#8212;sometimes as many as 25,000 per weekend&#8212;much as they send out missionaries to spread the Gospel. The church has been credited with almost single-handedly getting Prop. 8 passed, despite a well-funded opposition with backing from Hollywood.</p> \n\n<p>Prop. 8 was a Pyrrhic victory for the Mormons, however. Their role, which the church sought to keep under wraps, was exposed by Karger, who tracked the individual donations pouring into the Yes on 8 campaign back to church members. LGBT activists responded by publicizing the church&#8217;s involvement, running an ad, for example, showing fake Mormon missionaries knocking on the door of a lesbian couple and then rifling through their drawers and tearing up their marriage license.</p> \n\n<p>The negative exposure prompted protests, and many Mormons publicly renounced their church membership. One of them was then 28-year-old Matthew Lawrence, the son of official LDS pollster Gary Lawrence, who had led the Prop. 8 fight. &#8220;I love my family so much, but it&#8217;s hard to not take this personally. We had a brief falling-out over Prop. 22, but that got mended. But two anti-gay initiatives in eight years, it&#8217;s impossible not to feel attacked,&#8221; Matthew, who is gay, wrote in 2008.</p> \n\n<p>The LDS church had always struggled for public acceptance, and the negative press wasn&#8217;t helping. One poll, conducted a year after Prop. 8 passed, showed that the church&#8217;s favorability rating had fallen from 42 percent to 37 percent. But its image problem was nothing compared to the internal rifts the Mormons were experiencing. &#8220;The church probably deserved the black eye we got from Prop. 8,&#8221; says Mitch Mayne, an openly gay Mormon leader in the San Francisco area. &#8220;What the non-Mormon world didn&#8217;t get to see was how destructive that was inside the faith.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In response to the anger within Mormon ranks over Prop. 8, the president of the Oakland, California, stake (a stake is akin to a Catholic diocese) began organizing&amp;#160;gatherings of gay and straight members to try to bridge the differences. In September 2010, the disgruntled church members received a private audience with one of the church&#8217;s top officials, Marlin Jensen, who serves as the LDS&#8217;s historian. The church members tearfully told Jensen their stories&#8212;of being shunned by their families, and the homophobia generated by the Prop. 8 campaign. &#8220;We explained that [the church had] pitted father against son, mother against daughter, exactly the opposite of what we stand for,&#8221; says Mayne, who attended the meeting.</p> \n\n<p>After listening to them talk, Jensen did something almost unheard of in a church whose strict authoritarian hierarchy is unaccustomed to being challenged from below: He apologized &#8220;for the pain that Prop. 8 caused [us],&#8221; Mayne recalls, choking up at the memory. It was, he says, a &#8220;very meaningful event.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The apology from a high church official turned out to be just the beginning of a cultural shift toward greater acceptance of gays and lesbians within LDS ranks. In 2011, Mayne was called to serve as an official of his local San Francisco ward, as an openly gay man. It was a historic appointment in an institution with a long history of excommunicating openly gay members, which it referred to as people who were &#8220;afflicted&#8221; with same-sex attraction.</p> \n\n<p>Since then, the church has opened its doors to LGBT members in many places, Mayne says: &#8220;Everybody is welcome here. Nobody is under that threat of being excommunicated.&#8221; In 2012, the church even created a website, <a href=\"http://www.mormonsandgays.org\" type=\"external\">Mormonsandgays.org</a>, to convey its desire for more-humane treatment of LGBT members. Also last year, about 300 straight Mormons marched in the Salt Lake City pride parade, a significant and emotional first. Mayne says the new website, like the church, still has a long way to go, but he and other gay Mormons see it as a step in the right direction.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Perhaps most significantly, the church has made a concerted effort to bring LGBT kids back into the fold. Mayne points out that gay Mormon kids have significantly higher suicide rates than gay non-Mormon ones&#8212;a problem that has been attributed to the church&#8217;s longtime policy of forcing parents of gay kids to choose between their church and their children. It also has long been common practice for Mormon parents to kick LGBT adolescents out of their homes because of their sexual orientation. (When Matt Lawrence, the church pollster&#8217;s son, broke with his family over Prop. 8, he told stories about his family&#8217;s efforts to &#8220;straighten me out&#8221; by sending him to live with homophobic cousins in Utah.) Utah foster parents, too, generally <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">won&#8217;t take in LGBT children</a>. That&#8217;s one reason why heavily Mormon Utah has so many homeless LGBT kids on the streets. But even that is starting to change.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>The church has worked with the Family Acceptance Project at San Francisco State University to craft an educational booklet aimed specifically at helping Mormons parent their gay kids, to keep them safe at home and to prevent suicide. It&#8217;s a remarkably humane document instructing church members on how to embrace their gay kids even when they&#8217;re uncomfortable with their purple hair and transgendered friends. The pamphlet is now being used in lots of Mormon wards. Meanwhile, in Salt Lake City, where the church is headquartered, the church has teamed up with the&amp;#160;LGBT&amp;#160;community to open a shelter for young homeless people there, about 40 percent of whom are known to be&amp;#160;LGBT.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The LGBT community had reached out to the church several times before Prop. 8 and we&#8217;ve never been able to connect,&#8221; says Jim Dabakis, head of the Utah Democratic Party and cofounder of the Utah Pride Center in Salt Lake, who has been involved in these conversations. But after the Prop. 8 backlash, the Utah LGBT community, along with national leaders, commenced a series of meetings with church hierarchy. The first meetings were &#8220;a bit uncomfortable,&#8221;&amp;#160;Dabakis recalls. But then, &#8220;as we began to meet, and we began to introduce our families, it became much less an issue about legal points, what is the definition of a family, what kind of overarching legal principals are involved, and much more about Christian values and how people should be treated. Minds changed on both sides.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Not everything has changed, of course. The church still filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of Prop. 8, although it doesn&#8217;t read like the same sort of full-throated anti-gay sentiment that drove the initiative. The church lawyers who drafted the document seem to have bent over backward to express how much they like gays, and to frame the issue in terms of states&#8217; rights, as opposed to morality.</p> \n\n<p>Mormon church doctrine still defines homosexuality as a sin. The gay Mormon website clarifies that while having a same-sex attraction is not a sin, acting on it is. Mayne was only able to take on his leadership role in the church after he broke up with his longtime partner and was single again. And noncelibate LGBT members are still excluded from &#8220;temple recommends&#8221;&#8212;access to the church&#8217;s most sacred spaces and ceremonies.</p> \n\n<p>Dabakis says that there are still many points of disagreement. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think the church has given one iota on gay marriage&#8212;maybe they never will&#8212;and neither have we. On the other hand, we have found a lot of commonalities that we can work on,&#8221; he says, pointing towards the joint efforts to help homeless kids.</p> \n\n<p>The LGBT community&#8217;s best evidence of change within the church is that last year, in the only four states ever to pass marriage equality laws, the church &#8220;did not provide one dime or one volunteer,&#8221; Dabakis says. He adds that in Maryland, when one local Mormon leader tried to organize to oppose a pro-marriage-equality initiative, the church shut her down.</p> \n\n<p>Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules in the Prop. 8 case, the church responsible for its passage has been permanently changed for the better. In Mayne&#8217;s view, this all means that Prop. 8, with all its ugliness, happened for a reason: &#8220;I believe in our attempt to nail shut the Pandora&#8217;s box of gay marriage, we essentially blew the lid off of it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Mormon Church Abandons Its Crusade Against Gay Marriage", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2013/04/prop-8-mormons-gay-marriage-shift/", "published_at": "2013-04-12", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>My name is JACK ELY and I&#8217;m the one whose voice is heard daily on The Kingsmen&#8217;s 1963 recording of Louie Louie, (may it rest in peace) so you know I have some music business experience.</p> \n\n<p>First I&#8217;d like to express an opinion that probably will not be very popular but which oozes with truth. In the early &#8217;60&#8217;s when I was recording, records were thought of as a tool to help promote live performances. The live performances were the main revenue stream and the records were just promotional tools to get people to come see the shows. Somewhere this mode of thinking got turned upside down. Consequently in years hence, record companies, producers, et. all, have made recordings, hoping to profit from the sale of those recordings alone, regardless of whether or not the artist could ever pull it off live. This did some things to the music business that weren&#8217;t very healthy. First it made available to the general public, music of artists who may or may not be good live performers; almost anyone can make a good recording with enough cut-ins and loops. And&#8230; it made music by groups of players who never ever intended to perform that music live, and who may or may not have ever been able to get along with each other long enough to really sustain any kind of a road show.</p> \n\n<p>Music is meant to be played for the enjoyment of the audiences. For instance, if I go into the studio with an acoustic guitar and simultaneously play and sing on a recording, people would come to see me perform in that same mode; I.e. playing guitar and singing as a solo act. I don&#8217;t think they would come to see me expecting a full band. Conversely, if I advertised a &#8216;Night with Louie Louie&#8221; people would come expecting to see a rock band that they could dance to, and would be quite disappointed if I showed up with just my acoustic guitar.</p> \n\n<p>The suggestions that recordings are produced today just to sell recorded music is all backwards and the sooner the record companies and producers and artists figure this out the sooner they will all quit sniveling over the fact that the entire world is freely sharing their music digitally and isn&#8217;t willing to stop; and in fact will do anything to circumvent their efforts to get paid for the recordings alone.</p> \n\n<p>The days of producers and musicians putting bands together just to get a recording deal so they can get paid by the record company for a product that usually never even gets released; those days are over. It&#8217;s time record companies went back to their roots and became what they started out to be; entities who record working acts in order to</p> \n\n<p>1) capture the performance for posterity, and</p> \n\n<p>2) make a promotional tool to get audiences to the next show.</p> \n\n<p>The solution is to give the world all the free music it wants, but to give the recording entity, whether it be a record company or a producer, or whomever, a cut of every live performance. That will do at least two things and maybe more that I haven&#8217;t even thought about yet. First it will give everyone involved in the recordings a source of revenue (pay day) for all their hard work of producing and promoting the recordings. Second, it will weed out all the so-called &#8220;recording artists&#8221; who couldn&#8217;t, in a live venue, perform their way out of a paper bag. In a down economy the public craves live entertainment, so what better time to get back to basics. The timing couldn&#8217;t be better for a profitable turn around. So now is the time to get it going.</p> \n\n<p>I send you these thoughts in hopes that just maybe a new/old perspective on the subject of recorded music can be presented to the entire recording world and they can all start making a real profit.</p> \n\n<p>JACK ELY, the former lead singer of The Kingsmen, is a veteran horse trainer.

I figured it was a safe bet that Beck&#8217;s enthusiasm for full disclosure from media would be selective.</p> \n\n<p>A few hours later, I was staring into a camera lens at the CNN bureau in San Francisco while Beck launched into his opening. What had occurred on the &#8220;NBC Nightly News,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;was at best a major breach of journalistic integrity.&#8221; And he pointed out: &#8220;The problem isn&#8217;t what NBC is promoting. It&#8217;s what they&#8217;re not disclosing.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>A minute later, Beck asked his first question: &#8220;Norman, you agree with me that they should have disclosed this?&#8221; The unedited transcript tells what happened next.</p> \n\n<p>* * *</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;It&#8217;s a big problem when there&#8217;s not disclosure. I&#8217;m glad you opened this up. And I wouldn&#8217;t want any viewers of this program to be left with the impression that somehow General Electric is an environmentally conscious company.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;On the contrary, they have a 30-year history of refusing and actually fighting against efforts to make them clean up the Hudson River, which GE fouled with terrible quantities of horrific PCBs, other rivers as well. People told they can&#8217;t fish in the Hudson River. General Electric still lobbying to not have to clean up.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;General Electric, even today &#8212; and this report is very timely &#8212; General Electric is lobbying to get Congress to pass $18 billion in taxpayer-backed loan guarantees for a huge GE product which is General Electric components for nuclear power plants. So we should not be fooled in any way by efforts to greenwash General Electric or any other company.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;You know what&#8217;s amazing to me? GE has a bigger budget for &#8212; special interest budget than all of the oil companies combined, and yet nobody says anything. Let me reverse this.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Norman, do you think if I got on as somebody who says I don&#8217;t know what we can do about global warming, I&#8217;m not sure man causes it, and I certainly don&#8217;t want to have laws and regulations on this, if I got on and said that but I was being &#8212; my corporate &#8212; my corporate parent was Exxon Mobil, do you think I&#8217;d get away with that for a second without that being on the front page of the New York Times?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;Well, other networks, including General Electric&#8217;s NBC, have been very slow on global warming. And in fact, General Electric has major interest in components and products used by the oil and gas industry.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I think if you look across the board, all the major networks, even so-called public broadcasting, which has Chevron underwriting its &#8216;Washington Week&#8217; program every Friday, there is a problem, as you say. I think your words are very apt, &#8216;promoting&#8217; but &#8216;not disclosing.&#8217;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;But let&#8217;s be clear about this, Glenn. I have a list here, for instance, that I jotted down.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;ABC, owned by Disney. ABC doesn&#8217;t disclose in their relevant news reports about Disney&#8217;s stake in sweatshops.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Fox News &#8212; and now as of the last couple of days now, Wall Street Journal owned by the same entity, Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News Corp &#8212; they don&#8217;t disclose that the ownership is entangled with the Chinese government to the detriment of human rights but to the advancement of the profit margin of the parent company.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;See &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;We would be remiss, Glenn, if we left out CNN, because CNN has a huge multi, multibillion-dollar stake in Internet deregulation and the failure of the Congress to safeguard so far what would be called net neutrality. So every time CNN does a news report on the Internet, on efforts to regulate or deregulate or create a two- or three-tier system of the Internet, CNN News should disclose that Time Warner, the parent company, stands to gain or lose billions of dollars in those terms.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;And one more thing.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;Real quick.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;A major &#8212; a major advertiser for CNN is the largest military contractor in the United States, Lockheed Martin. So when you and others &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;I got news for you, Norman. Norman &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;&#8211; promote war &#8212; when you and others promote war on this network &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;Norman &#8212; Norman &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;&#8211; we have Lockheed Martin paying millions of dollars undisclosed. So I would quote you &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;Norman &#8212; Norman &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;Promoting but not disclosing is a bad way to go.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;Norman, let me just tell you this. First of all, Lockheed Martin is not a &#8212; not a corporate overlord of this program.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;It&#8217;s a major advertiser on CNN.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;That&#8217;s fine. That&#8217;s fine. Advertisers are different. But let &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;Well, it is fine, but it should be disclosed.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;Norman, let me just tell you something. If you think that it&#8217;s warmonger central downstairs at CNN, you&#8217;re out of your mind. But that&#8217;s a different story.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;Well, upstairs, when I watch Glenn Beck, in terms of attacking Iran, it certainly is. It&#8217;s lucrative for the oil companies, as well as for the major advertiser on CNN, Lockheed Martin.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;But we&#8217;re not talking about advertisers. We are talking about &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t want to talk about it. So let&#8217;s talk about the Internet stake.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;No, no, no. Norman &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about the Internet stake that the owners of CNN have. Huge profits to be made or lost by the parent company of CNN depending on what happens in Washington in terms of Internet regulation.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;Norman, let me tell you something.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;That should be acknowledged, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;Absolutely. And if it was on this program, it would be acknowledged.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I thank you very much for your time.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;That just goes to show you, you&#8217;ve got to beware of everybody who you&#8217;re getting your news from. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if once in a while somebody came on and said, you know, I don&#8217;t really have an agenda except the truth? It&#8217;s my truth. If you don&#8217;t like it, you should go someplace else.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>* * *</p> \n\n<p>During the back-and-forth, I&#8217;d understated the present-day role of Chevron as a funder of key news programming on PBS. Actually the Chevron Corporation, which signed on as an underwriter of &#8220;Washington Week&#8221; last year, no longer helps pay the piper there &#8212; but the massive energy firm does currently funnel big bucks to the most influential show on PBS, the nightly &#8220;NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The corporate funders of the &#8220;NewsHour&#8221; now include not only Chevron but also AT&amp;amp;T and Pacific Life. There must be dozens of journalistic reports on the program every week &#8212; whether relevant to the business worlds of energy, communications or insurance &#8212; that warrant, and lack, real-time disclosures while the news accounts are on the air. Meanwhile, over at &#8220;Washington Week,&#8221; the corporate cash now flows in from the huge military contractor Boeing and the National Mining Association.</p> \n\n<p>And that&#8217;s just &#8220;public broadcasting.&#8221; On avowedly commercial networks, awash in corporate ownership interests and advertising revenues, a thorough policy of disclosure in the course of news coverage would require that most of the airtime be devoted to shedding light on the media outlet conflicts-of-interest of the reporting in progress.</p> \n\n<p>And what about Glenn Beck? The guy is another in a long line of demagogues riding a bull market for pseudo-populism.

Although the amount of money that couples receive in Social Security income will vary depending on work history, income, and when couples begin receiving payments, the average couple is receiving $2,212 per month this year, according to the Social Security Administration.</p> \n\n<p>Are you likely to get this much money, too? Read on to learn how Social Security calculates its payment, and what you should do to maximize your benefit.</p> \n\n<p>First, a quick bit of backgroundMany Americans approach retirement thinking that Social Security is a savings account that's similar to a retirement account, such as an IRA or a 401(k) plan. It isn't. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system, and that means that the 12.4% payroll tax you pay today covers the cost of current Social Security recipient's benefits, not your future benefit.</p> \n\n<p>While Social Security accounts for 90% or more of income for nearly a quarter of current married retirees, the system was never meant to provide the lion's share of a retiree's income. Instead, Social Security is supposed to act as a safety net. As such, it replaces about 40% of the average recipient's pre-retirement income.</p> \n\n<p>SOURCE: PIXABAY.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>How's it calculatedNow that we've covered those points, let's dig into the calculation Social Security uses to determine your benefit.</p> \n\n<p>First, Social Security calculates your benefit using a complex formula that converts income earned during your highest 35 working years into today's dollars. Then, those adjusted figures are added together and divided by 420 -- the number of months in 35 years -- to get an average monthly earnings number. That average monthly earnings number is then broken into chunks, and multipliers are used to calculate your monthly benefit at full retirement age, or the age at which you can claim and receive 100% of your benefit (more on that in a bit).</p> \n\n<p>For example, a person who was born in or after 1954 would multiply the first $856 in indexed monthly earnings by 90%, any amount between $856 and $5,157 by 32%, and any amount above $5,157 by 15%. Once those calculations are done, the resulting numbers are added together and rounded down to the nearest dollar. That sum is a person's estimated monthly retirement benefit at full retirement age.</p> \n\n<p>This formula is used to calculate benefits for the primary recipient, but it's also the number that is used to calculate a spouse's benefit, too. Generally, if a spouse is retiring at full retirement age, the spouse can receive half of the amount that the primary recipient would receive at their full retirement age. If the spouse claims early, then the amount they receive will be reduced.</p> \n\n<p>For example, if a spouse born in 1960 claims benefits two years before their full-retirement age, they'd receive 41.67% of the primary recipient's benefit.It may also be helpful to know that, if a spouse's own work record results in a higher Social Security payment than the spousal benefit, then the spouse would receive that higher payment instead.</p> \n\n<p>Although these calculations can be complex, the Social Security Administration provides a <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/planners/benefitcalculators.html\" type=\"external\">handy calculator Opens a New Window.</a> that can allow married couples to better estimate their benefit when they retire, or individuals can log in to Social Security online and find out their specific benefit.</p> \n\n<p>SOURCE: SENIORLIVING.ORG.</p> \n\n<p>Maximizing your incomeIn the past, couples could use a file-and-suspend strategy to increase their overall Social Security income. This strategy involved the primary worker and the spouse claiming Social Security at full retirement age. Then the primary worker would suspend his or her payments so that they could benefit from delayed benefit credits that are awarded to people who hold off on receiving Social Security until they reach 70 years old.</p> \n\n<p>Unfortunately, this \"loophole\" closes at the end of March, but there are a couple of options that can still help couples boost their Social Security income.</p> \n\n<p>First, because Social Security uses the highest 35-years of income to calculate average monthly adjusted earnings, it may benefit couples to work a year or two longer. If the filer's work history includes more than 35 years, then every year worked at a higher income eliminates a low-income earning year, thereby boosting the monthly benefit.</p> \n\n<p>If that's an unpalatable option (and trust me, I understand), and you have other sources of retirement income, then it might be worth delaying Social Security until you reach age 70. Claiming at age 62, the earliest age possible, results in income that is less than you'd receive at your full retirement age (currently age 66); but if you were born after 1943, you'll get an 8% yearly increase to your benefit for every year that you delay receiving Social Security beyond your full retirement age, up to age 70. Unfortunately, delaying until 70 won't increase your spouse's benefit because the spousal benefit will always be based on your full retirement benefit instead.</p> \n\n<p>Nevertheless, combining your higher income from delaying with your spouse's benefit will still provide more income than if you both took Social Security sooner.</p> \n\n<p>The article <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/19/how-much-do-married-couples-get-in-social-security.aspx\" type=\"external\">How Much Do Married Couples Get in Social Security?

Presumably you don't want to forego having a happy retirement, so you'll need to find an approach that won't require you to work until you're 90 or live on cat food. Fortunately, it's not too late to get your act together and develop some sources of income.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Now is the time to pull out all the stops on saving money. Granted, you don't have tons of time for the magic of compounding to help that money grow, but you do have at least a decade or two -- that's enough time to allow some returns to build up, but only if you start saving right away. First, max out your retirement contributions for IRA and 401(k) accounts. Someone age 50 or older may contribute $6,500 per year to IRAs and $60,000 per year to 401(k)s. If you don't have access to a 401(k), then max out your IRA and stick the rest into a standard investment account. You won't get the immediate tax benefits, but at least you've got more capital building up to provide future income. https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/cola-increases-for-dollar-limitations-on-benefits-and-contributions</p> \n\n<p>Of course, now you're probably wondering how you could possibly save thousands of dollars when you're living paycheck to paycheck. The answer is to find more income -- and put every penny of the extra money into savings. Some options for increasing your income include asking your boss for a raise, working longer hours, taking a part-time job on the side, holding a garage sale or otherwise disposing of unwanted items for a profit, turning a hobby into a source of income, and so on. Whatever new source of income you find, tuck the money away in savings immediately so you're not tempted to spend it on something else.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Getty Images.</p> \n\n<p>If you planned to retire at age 65 or 67, consider putting it off a few years longer.

If your Social Security benefits are higher, you won't need as much income from those underfunded retirement accounts. And every year that you continue to put money into your retirement accounts instead of taking it out will help your long-term financial outlook immensely.</p> \n\n<p>If you're laboring under a burden of heavy debt, you should make getting rid of that debt a priority. Not only will debt be an extra expense during retirement, but the interest you pay on that debt will require additional income just to keep up with the payments. Pay off high interest rate debt such as credit cards as soon as possible; the interest you pay on credit card debt will be more than enough to cancel out any returns you're getting on your investments. Once you've offloaded the most dangerous debt, consider paying off less expensive debt such as mortgages, car payments, and any remaining student loans as well. Getting rid of those monthly payments will lower your income needs considerably and allow you to live comfortably in retirement on a much lower income.</p> \n\n<p>Obviously, a retirement won't be much of a retirement if you're working full time. However, if you have a part-time job working just a few hours a week, you can add to an income that's not quite enough to meet your needs. Rather than settling for flipping burgers at McDonald's, try to find a part-time job that you will actually enjoy. For example, if you love gardening, consider expanding your garden and selling seeds, plants, produce, and flowers at your local farmers market. The resulting income probably won't be enough to support you all by itself, but it could be enough to supplement the income from a small retirement account. It's not really work if you love doing it, right?</p> \n\n<p>If you own a house, it can potentially be an excellent source of retirement income. You can tap directly into the equity you have stored in your house through a home equity line of credit or, more drastically, a <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/retirement/general/2016/05/21/should-you-get-a-reverse-mortgage.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">reverse mortgage Opens a New Window.</a>(but be aware that the latter option comes with some serious <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/retirement/2016/10/01/how-safe-is-a-reverse-mortgage.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">drawbacks Opens a New Window.</a>).You can sell the house outright and move into a cheaper house or an apartment, using the funds from the sale for income. Or you can simply rent out a room and increase your income that way. The latter is a particularly good option if you live in a college town, as students are often desperate for cheap digs.</p> \n\n<p>When you start saving late, investments such as stocks and bonds have less time to accumulate returns and therefore provide a large base you can tap into for income. However, if you put that money into buying a rental property, you can have a steady stream of income for as long as you can keep tenants in the building. Whether or not this is a viable strategy will depend on your situation and on where you live; consult with your financial planner before making a firm decision to pursue real estate as an investment option.</p> \n\n<p>If you've waited until you're near retirement to start saving, you have a problem but it's not an insurmountable one. Add up your expenses, figure out how much income you'll need to get by in retirement, and then try one or more of the above ideas to reach that income goal.

The company said it was introducing a new metric to fix the problem.</p> \n\n<p>Some ad agency executives who were also informed by Facebook about the change started digging deeper, prompting Facebook to give them a more detailed account, one of the people familiar with the situation said.</p> \n\n<p>Ad buying agency Publicis Media was told by Facebook that the earlier counting method likely overestimated average time spent watching videos by between 60% and 80%, according to a late August letter Publicis Media sent to clients that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p> \n\n<p>A spokeswoman for Publicis Media, a division of Publicis Groupe SA, referred calls to Facebook. Publicis was responsible for purchasing roughly $77 billion in ads on behalf of marketers around the world in 2015, according to estimates from research firm RECMA.</p> \n\n<p>GroupM, the ad buying unit of WPP Plc, also was notified of the discrepancy by Facebook, another person familiar with the matter said.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>\"We recently discovered an error in the way we calculate one of our video metrics,\" Facebook said in a statement. \"This error has been fixed, it did not impact billing, and we have notified our partners both through our product dashboards and via sales and publisher outreach. We also renamed the metric to make it clearer what we measure. This metric is one of many our partners use to assess their video campaigns.\"</p> \n\n<p>The news is an embarrassment for Facebook, which has been touting the rapid growth of video consumption across its platform in recent years.</p> \n\n<p>Due to the miscalculated data, marketers may have misjudged the performance of video advertising they have purchased from Facebook over the past two years. It also may have impacted their decisions about how much to spend on Facebook video versus other video ad sellers such as Google's YouTube, Twitter, and even TV networks.</p> \n\n<p>Media companies and publishers are affected, too, since they've been given inaccurate data about the consumption of their video content across the social network. Many use that information to help determine the types of content they post.</p> \n\n<p>For the past two years Facebook only counted video views of more than three seconds when calculating its \"Average Duration of Video Viewed\" metric. Video views of under three seconds were not factored in, thereby inflating the average. Facebook's new metric, \"Average Watch Time\", will reflect video views of any duration. That will replace the earlier metric.</p> \n\n<p>In its note to clients, Publicis said the change was an attempt to obfuscate Facebook's earlier miscalculations.</p> \n\n<p>\"In an effort to distance themselves from the incorrect metrics, Facebook is deprecating [the old metrics] and introducing 'new' metrics in September. Essentially, they're coming up with new names for what they were meant to measure in the first place,\" the memo said.</p> \n\n<p>The miscounting could also fuel concerns among advertisers and media companies about the so-called \"walled gardens\" that companies including Facebook and Google are often described as operating. Both companies keep a tight grip on data, and only allow limited third-party tracking firms to plug into their systems.</p> \n\n<p>Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever, said in an interview last year, tech companies that don't let third parties measure their platforms is equivalent to \"letting them mark their own homework.\"</p> \n\n<p>The Publicis note said, \"This once again illuminates the absolute need to have 3rd party tagging and verification on Facebook's platform. Two years of reporting inflated performance numbers is unacceptable.\"</p> \n\n<p>Shalini Ramachandran contributed to this article.</p> \n\n<p>Write to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com and Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com</p>", "title": "Facebook Overestimated Key Video Metric for Two Years", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/industries/2016/09/23/facebook-overestimated-key-video-metric-for-two-years622091.html", "published_at": "2016-09-23", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\"http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1602429/\" mce_href=\"http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1602429/\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Justin Timberlake has a tattoo on his ankle of Chinese characters representing the word &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ldquo;qu&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;rdquo; which translates to:&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span style=\"font-size:9px;\" mce_style=\"font-size:9px;\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;(&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\"http://www.polldaddy.com\" mce_href=\"http://www.polldaddy.com\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;online surveys&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\"http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1602436/\" mce_href=\"http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1602436/\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Lindsay Lohan has the Italian phrase &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ldquo;La bella vita&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;rdquo; on her lower back.

And why aren&#8217;t Romney and other Republicans moving to the political center as the election approaches?</p> \n\n<p>Both mysteries point to an important fact about the 2012 campaign: For conservatives, this is a go-for-broke election. They and a Republican Party now under their control hope to eke out a narrow victory in November on the basis of a quite radical program that includes more tax cuts for the rich, deep reductions in domestic spending, big increases in military spending, and a sharp rollback in government regulation.</p> \n\n<p>In the process, the right hopes to redefine middle-of-the-road policies as &#8220;left wing,&#8221; thereby altering the balance in the American political debate.</p> \n\n<p>What should alarm both liberals and moderates is that this is the rare election in which such a strategy has a chance of succeeding. Conservatives have their opening not because the country has moved far to the right but courtesy of economic discontent, partisan polarization and the right&#8217;s success in defining Obama as standing well to the left of where he actually does.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The Obama campaign is trying to disrupt this narrative on multiple fronts. Why did Obama respond so quickly and forcefully to Romney&#8217;s effort to use the president&#8217;s &#8220;you didn&#8217;t build that&#8221; quotation as a way of casting him as an enemy of small business? It&#8217;s not that the attack was true. In fact, it was blatantly false, given that in the same speech Obama praised &#8220;hard work,&#8221; &#8220;responsibility&#8221; and &#8220;individual initiative.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The words did, however, play to a stereotype of Obama as an advocate of big government who mistrusts business. The distortion resonated, said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, because key voter groups that Romney is trying to win suspect the four words reflect &#8220;secretly what he [Obama] believes.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Moreover, Republicans want to recast the Obama campaign&#8217;s most effective line of attack &#8212; that Romney is a very wealthy out-of-touch financier who &#8220;pioneered&#8221; the outsourcing of jobs, kept a lot of money in foreign accounts, and refuses to release additional tax returns &#8212; as being less about Romney than about the president&#8217;s supposed hostility to &#8220;success&#8221; and to business. Much is riding on the interpretation (or willful misinterpretation) of a short sentence in a long speech.</p> \n\n<p>The go-for-broke strategy has a chance for another reason: In this election, the number of genuine, middle-of-the-road swing voters is very small. For both candidates, this puts a premium not only on high turnout among party base groups but also on very large victory margins within them. McInturff thinks we may be moving from an electoral model based on swing or undecided voters to a world of what he calls &#8220;committed versus elastic&#8221; voter groups.</p> \n\n<p>For example, it is widely agreed that white working-class voters will support Romney. But much depends upon Romney&#8217;s margin among them. If Obama holds Romney&#8217;s lead in the white working class to around 15 points, he likely wins. Romney can win if he pushes his advantage with these less well-off voters to 25 points or more. Obama&#8217;s Bain/tax returns offensive against Romney is aimed directly at this constituency.</p> \n\n<p>Similarly, Romney will lose the Latino vote by a landslide. But holding his deficit to, say, 30 points instead of 40 will matter. And by portraying Obama as anti-business, McInturff said, Romney could gain ground among college-educated white men. In the pollster&#8217;s terms, what matters is the &#8220;elasticity&#8221; in all these constituencies.</p> \n\n<p>The potential flaw in the conservative strategy could turn out to be reality itself. Obama&#8217;s actual record is neither left wing nor anti-business. Public opinion is strongly hostile to many items on the conservative agenda. Most voters, for example, reject the idea that more tax cuts for the wealthy are central to future prosperity. Much of the domestic spending that Republicans would reduce has strong support, one reason Romney avoids budget specifics.</p> \n\n<p>Republicans want to play down the implications of what they would do in power and paint Obama as someone he isn&#8217;t. Normally, this strategy wouldn&#8217;t work. But this is a moment when abnormal levels of economic turmoil are feeding a profound mistrust of government.

On Thursday, they are alleged by the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights to have beheaded at least 17 more people</a>, among them Syrian Arab Army POWs, pro-regime militiamen, and pro-regime civilians. The terrorist organization ordered the population of the city to remain in doors. The city of some 140,000 (many of them refugees from Homs and other urban centers damaged by the civil war) fell to Daesh on Wednesday, marking the second city conquered by the organization this week (Ramadi in Iraq fell to them on Sunday).</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>On Thursday, Daesh forces took two villages outside Palmyra on the road to Damascus, <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.net/news/arabic/2015/5/22/%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B8%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B9-%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%B7-%D8%AA%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84-%D8%B9%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D9%88%D8%AF%20\" type=\"external\">claiming to have killed 50 Syrian Arab Army troops who were attempt to flee to Homs.</a></p> \n\n<p>For Syrians, Palmyra is famous not only for its historical ruins but more darkly as the site of the notorious Tadmor Prison, where Muslim fundamentalists were imprisoned, including for thought crimes, and torture was practiced intensively. The regime is said to have moved the prisoners to a secret location before the city fell.</p> \n\n<p>Personally, I disagree with those analysts suggesting that Palmyra is a strategic asset or that its fall brings Daesh to the gates of Damascus. It is a small town out in the eastern desert away from the population centers along the western border of Syria. Two-thirds of Syrians live in the corridors linking Damascus to Latakia and Aleppo via Homs. Daesh isn&#8217;t all that much closer to Damascus than it was in southern Raqqa province already. Maybe having it improves the organization&#8217;s logistics with its assets in Iraq, but that is about it. Some observers are also claiming that Daesh now controls half of Syrian territory. But that is a silly way of counting things. The eastern desert is sparsely populated and it isn&#8217;t even clear what &#8216;controlling&#8217; it would mean. The scorpions and lizards wave black banners? What Daesh controls is mostly white <a href=\"http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Syria_Ethnic_1935_lg.png%20\" type=\"external\">in the below ethnic map of Syria</a> (i.e. unpopulated).</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/images/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-22-at-2.44.30-AM.png\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>The more colorful spots are non-Sunni ethnic minorities like the Druze, Alawites, Christians, etc. However tired these groups might be of the war, they will go to Israeli-style mass citizen mobilization before they will accept being conquered by Daesh. That is, the al-Assad regime may well fall in the end, but the conquest of Palmyra by Daesh does not actually indicate that fall is imminent.</p> \n\n<p>Many Syrians on Twitter are complaining that world leaders like President Francois Hollande of France are all of a sudden energized about Syria now that Palmyra has fallen to Daesh, because of the organization&#8217;s iconoclastic policies and the danger it will destroy the Roman ruins. They want to know where Hollande has been while over 200,000 Syrians were killed in the civil war.</p> \n\n<p>The big question is how Daesh, supposedly being bombed by coalition aircraft, was allowed to send out a substantial convoy down desert roads to Palmyra from Raqqa. The Pentagon has been issuing statistics on so many bombing raids etc. for months, but unless the bombing is degrading Daesh&#8217;s capabilities then it is a waste of taxpayer money. In Kobane, the bombing succeeded in keeping the city out of Daesh hands because Kurdish Marxist guerrillas also fought it on the ground. But the US can hardly give the genocidal al-Assad regime close air support. Without a ground force to support, the US bombing is merely symbolic.</p> \n\n<p>The situation is different in Iraq, where US and coalition bombing raids have helped push Daesh back in Diyala, Salahuddin and Ninewa Provinces, in conjunction with ground operations by Kurdish Peshmerga or the Iraqi army and its Shiite paramilitaries. In that context, the fall of Ramadi was probably preventable with the right coordination. In Syria, I don&#8217;t see the US aerial intervention as so far having been consequential.</p> \n\n<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p> \n\n<p>Related video:</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/JrsJturkS7s%20\" type=\"external\">Associated Press: &#8221;Ancient City of Palmyra Falls to IS Militants&#8221;</a></p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />", "title": "Islamic State Beheaded Dozens in Palmyra, but How Strategic Is the City?", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/islamic-state-beheaded-dozens-in-palmyra-but-how-strategic-is-the-city/", "published_at": "2015-05-23", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>In what is already being called the worst flu season in a decade, an abnormally high number of influenza cases could end up costing employers billions of dollars.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>The likely increase would be related to higher health-care costs and an expected decline in production as more employees miss work due to sick days.</p> \n\n<p>When calculating the direct cost of hospitalizations and outpatient visits, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that an average seasonal flu outbreak costs the nation's employers $10.4 billion.</p> \n\n<p>And that doesn't even include indirect costs such as the loss of productivity.</p> \n\n<p>We're three months into the flu season and already it appears worse than usual, and the season's peak, typically January and February, is only just beginning.</p> \n\n<p>So far, 29 of 41 states reporting flu cases said the outbreak is at \"severe\" levels.

Preparing for the worst, companies should also have plans in place in the event of a massive outbreak.</p> \n\n<p>That includes, if possible, not running at full capacity by building inventories, as well as taking appropriate measures to shift to telecom mode if necessary by giving employees the ability to efficiently set up shop and work from home.</p> \n\n<p>Lastly, companies that host flu vaccinations, promote the importance of getting vaccinated and cut down on meetings when a flu outbreak begins are ahead of the game, Challenger said.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Worst Flu Season in a Decade Could Cost Employers Billions", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2013/01/09/worsening-flu-season-could-costs-companies-billions.html", "published_at": "2013-01-09", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>Veteran newsman Ted Koppel stopped by \"The O'Reilly Factor\" to share his thoughts on what networks like Fox News are doing to this country.

Obama has endorsed that situation by again referring to the torture as just the actions of &#8220;a few people.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It was hardly that, however, and he knows it. Torture was a major part of the Bush/Cheney so-called &#8220;War&#8221; on Terror, and was being conducted on an industrial scale, with White House lawyers providing legal cover, the Secretary of Defense sending memos urging every more aggressive techniques, and government doctors and psychologists working assiduously to make them more &#8220;effective.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The illogic of Obama&#8217;s position on these photos is stunning. Since we know the photos exist, the refusal to make them public can only feed a sense that they must be worse than the horrific photos of torture at Abu Ghraib Prison which were already released. Nobody is going to assume that the photos in the White House&#8217;s possession are less offensive than what has already been discovered and made public&#8211;for why would the administration be worried about that?</p> \n\n<p>The truth is always better than a cover-up, and what we now have the president advocating is a cover-up of American torture.</p> \n\n<p>But that&#8217;s only part of the president&#8217;s slide into Cheneyism. We have the president now calling for the possible indefinite detention of terror suspects&#8211;an idea that only insures that there will always be an incentive for recruiting more terrorists (to avenge those in captivity)&#8211;and that makes a joke of our own Constitution, which guarantees everyone&#8211;not just citizens&#8211;the right to a trial, the right to a presumption of innocence, and protection from &#8220;cruel and unusual punishment,&#8221; which indefinite detention certainly is.</p> \n\n<p>The war in Afghanistan, which now must be called Obama&#8217;s War, thanks to his policy of escalation, is also becoming Cheneyesque, with the firing of Gen. David McKiernan, and his replacement as head of the Afghanistan War by Gen. Stanley McChrystal. Gen. McChrystal hails from the Special Forces, and played a role in the torture that was integral to the US war and occupation in Iraq.&amp;#160; Far from being put in charge of operations in Afghanistan, where public backing for the US military is virtually non-existent at this point, McChrystal should be facing investigation and possible prosecution here at home for his role in torture of captives.</p> \n\n<p>It has never made sense to initiate a war in Afghanistan in order to go after a band of criminal terrorists hidiing out in the mountains. Bush and Cheney turned what should have been a focused hunt for Al Qaeda terrorists into a war on the Taliban government and ultimately the people of Afghanistan.&amp;#160; Obama has continued that error, and now blithely hyphenates the terms Al Qaeda and Taliban in defining the &#8220;enemy&#8221; of American forces in that country.</p> \n\n<p>Such a war can never be won, and can only lead to tragedy, not just for the people of Afghanistan, for whom it is already that, but for American troops and ultimately for America itself.</p> \n\n<p>It is a war that never should have been fought, and which now should be ended as rapidly as possible.</p> \n\n<p>Obama at this point, by covering up for official torture, and by signing on to and expanding the war in Afghanistan, is dooming his presidency, further staining the reputation of the United States, and ultimately furthering the decline of the country that was set in motion by his predecessors.</p> \n\n<p>DAVE LINDORFF is a Philadelphia-based journalist and columnist.

The North said the missile reached a height of 4,475 kilometers (2,780 miles) and traveled 950 kilometers (590 miles) before accurately hitting a sea target, similar to the flight data announced by South Korea&#8217;s military.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>It said leader Kim Jong Un after the successful launch &#8220;declared with pride&#8221; that the country has achieved its goal of becoming a &#8220;rocket power.&#8221; State TV said Kim gave the order on Tuesday and broadcast a photo of Kim&#8217;s signed order where he wrote: &#8220;Test launch is approved. Taking place at the daybreak of Nov. 29! Fire with courage for the party and country!&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The firing is a clear message of defiance aimed at the Trump administration, which a week earlier had restored North Korea to a U.S. list of terror sponsors. It also ruins nascent diplomatic efforts, raises fears of war or a pre-emptive U.S. strike and casts a deeper shadow over the security of the Winter Olympics early next year in South Korea.</p> \n\n<p>A rattled Seoul responded by almost immediately launching three of its own missiles in a show of force. President Moon Jae-in expressed worry North Korea&#8217;s missile threat could force the United States to attack the North before it masters a nuclear-tipped long-range missile, something experts say may be imminent.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;If North Korea completes a ballistic missile that could reach from one continent to another, the situation can spiral out of control,&#8221; Moon said at an emergency meeting in Seoul, according to his office. &#8220;We must stop a situation where North Korea miscalculates and threatens us with nuclear weapons or where the United States considers a pre-emptive strike.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Moon has repeatedly declared the U.S. cannot attack the North without Seoul&#8217;s approval, but many here worry Washington may act without South Korean input.</p> \n\n<p>The launch was North Korea&#8217;s first since it fired an intermediate-range missile over Japan on Sept. 15 and may have broken any efforts at diplomacy. U.S. officials have sporadically floated the idea of direct talks with North Korea if it maintained restraint.</p> \n\n<p>The missile also appears to improve on North Korea&#8217;s past launches.</p> \n\n<p>If flown on a standard trajectory, instead of Wednesday&#8217;s lofted angle, the missile would have a range of more than 13,000 kilometers (8,100 miles), said U.S. scientist David Wright, a physicist who closely tracks North Korea&#8217;s missile and nuclear programs. &#8220;Such a missile would have more than enough range to reach Washington, D.C., and in fact any part of the continental United States,&#8221; Wright wrote in a blog post for the Union for Concerned Scientists.</p> \n\n<p>North Korea&#8217;s description of a &#8220;super-large heavy&#8221; warhead could raise debate on whether it plans another nuclear test to demonstrate it has such a weapon. When the North flight-tested two of its older ICBM models, the Hwasong-14s, in July, it said the missiles were capable of delivering &#8220;large-sized heavy&#8221; warheads. The North went on to conduct its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3, which it described as a detonation of a weapon built for ICBMs.</p> \n\n<p>South Korea&#8217;s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing the possibility of a nuclear test &#8220;cannot be discounted,&#8221; lawmaker Kim Byung-kee said.</p> \n\n<p>The missile was launched from near Pyongyang, and Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said it landed inside of Japan&#8217;s special economic zone in the Sea of Japan, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) west of Aomori, which is on the northern part of Japan&#8217;s main island of Honshu.</p> \n\n<p>A big unknown, however, is the missile&#8217;s payload. If, as expected, it carried a light mock warhead, then its effective range would have been shorter, analysts said.</p> \n\n<p>The analyses of Wednesday&#8217;s test suggest progress by Pyongyang in developing a weapon of mass destruction that could strike the U.S. mainland. President Donald Trump has vowed to prevent North Korea from having that capability &#8212; using military force if necessary.</p> \n\n<p>Kim Dong-yub, a former South Korean military official who is now an analyst at Seoul&#8217;s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the missile is likely an upgraded version of its old ICBM with an enhanced second-stage. He believes the North will try to evaluate the weapon&#8217;s performance, including the warhead&#8217;s ability to survive atmospheric re-entry and strike the intended target, before it attempts a test that shows the full range of the missile.</p> \n\n<p>In response to the launch, Trump said the United States will &#8220;take care of it.&#8221; He told reporters after the launch: &#8220;It is a situation that we will handle.&#8221; He did not elaborate.</p> \n\n<p>The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Wednesday afternoon at the request of Japan, the U.S. and South Korea.</p> \n\n<p>When the Trump administration declared North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism, the U.S. also imposed new sanctions on North Korean shipping firms and Chinese trading companies dealing with the North. North Korea called the terror designation a &#8220;serious provocation&#8221; that justifies its development of nuclear weapons.</p> \n\n<p>South Koreans are famously nonchalant about North Korea&#8217;s military moves, but there is worry about what the North&#8217;s weapons tests might mean for next year&#8217;s Winter Olympics in the South. Moon ordered a close review of whether the launch could hurt South Korea&#8217;s efforts to successfully host the games in Pyeongchang, which begin Feb. 9.</p> \n\n<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who spoke with Trump, said Japan will not back down against any provocation and would maximize pressure on the North in its strong alliance with the U.S.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Associated Press writers Matthew Pennington, Lolita C.

How are you getting along without a country? Last I heard you were stuck in that broken down bus known as the old U S of A. Didn&#8217;t that thing lose its steering after they ripped out the old Constitution? Now, shit, you tell me the brakes are shot and the passengers are what? Bat shit? Still talking about the Democratic Party as if it were, you know, a thing? Trying to shoe-horn yet another Clintonista into the driver&#8217;s seat. Hey, look on the bright side. It might only be mad cow. You can hope. Anyway, enough of Trump, Hilary, Republicans, Democrats and the whole God awful stew of yesterday&#8217;s news. Good-bye to the whole have-your-cake-and-bomb-them-too mentality. Bury the fuckers. It&#8217;s over. Good riddance.</p> \n\n<p>The question is what are you going to do now, player? I mean that bus is headed down the mountain. All the f&#8217;ing passingers are screaming. &#8220;do something! Do something!&#8221; But there&#8217;s not one f&#8217;ing asshole on the whole God damned bus who can act. I know, scientists are revealing truths, politicians scheming and babbling incoherently, but hey, who is shitting whom? All that means jack. It&#8217;s out of f&#8217;ing control! It&#8217;s obvious. The land of the free and the home of the brave? No man, it&#8217;s an improvised explosive device tied to a runaway bus. Where is right and where wrong? Who the fuck&#8217;s got his finger on the nukes? Two to one his other finger is up his ass. What&#8217;s the dot gov doing man? The vehicle is smashing into people, wrecking countries. What for? Democracy? Excuse me? It is death in the largefamily size, plain and simple. And the family is your family, Buddy..</p> \n\n<p>The whole world watches with horror while this out-of-control motherfucker careens down the mountain. This sad remains of a country is smashing everything up. I know, I know, it&#8217;s the deep state, pulling levers, wrenching the wheel, pumping pedals but it don&#8217;t mean shit. That&#8217;s because the deep-state is bonkers, stupid, vicious and never learned to drive an out-of-control motherfucker like this baby. That is, if the deep-state exists. I mean who the fuck knows? Anyway, the shit they pull, if they really pull shit, is not going to save their asses let alone yours.</p> \n\n<p>So why is the deep-state still in control? What keeps the deep-state in control of this out-of-control mother fucker? Assuming they exist of course. Nothing about them is legitimate. The whole dot gov thing is a punch and judy show with a stick of dynamite up its ass. Secretly, behind the scenes the deep state is babbling out of f&#8217;ing control. They are hopeless on every count. Still they slip the bullshit to the bullshitters and everyone toddles along behind.</p> \n\n<p>How does it work? How does the bullshit get to the bullshitter. Deep-state guys must tell non-deep-state guys to do things, or convey to them that they should do things in some circuitous underhand deep-state way, right? That is if there really are deep-state guys. I mean it&#8217;s non-deep-state guys who actually do the dirty work, correct? Deep-state guys don&#8217;t actually do shit. Deep-state guys get things done with hints and signs and shit and who knows what to signal their pleasure or displeasure to non-deep-state guys who toddle off in service to the deep state guys who may or may not exist. Non-deep-state guys learn to divine deep-state guys&#8217; desires even without nods and winks and whatever. It&#8217;s all one big bollocks of bosses and lackeys and subtle hints and raised eyebrows and gobs of hypocrisy to cover over a cuckoo, vicious, moronic, and totally fucked up pile of deep-state shit. Of course now I&#8217;m talking about the highest level.</p> \n\n<p>But deep-state guys, if they exist, are still just guys, right? I mean, they are just guys! Why are those non-deep-state guys kissing their butts? Given the obvious cluelessness of the deep-state guys hinting the planet into the crapper, isn&#8217;t your obedience a little, how should I put it, dumb? I know those deep-state guys are awesome, but come on. It&#8217;s just habit, isn&#8217;t it? I mean the USA, aside from being this out-of-control bomb, is now just a bad habit, isn&#8217;t it? Courts? Elections? Constitution? Forget about it. It&#8217;s just habit. There&#8217;s no rhyme or reason, even for the deep-state guys. And given that it&#8217;s taking us to the crapper, a bad habit. Forget about the founding fathers, this shit is really happening, dude.</p> \n\n<p>I suppose you could get money and power so-called from sucking up, but is that enough to trade for species extinction? What good is toddling along behind the deep state guys on a planet cooked well-done? Why not, as Nancy Reagan put it, just say no? Okay, deep-state guys will be deep-state guys. I sure as hell am not going to talk them out of it, even though they are being stupid. They are going to deep-state themselves right into deep do do, assuming they exist. But you, kid, you! Are you ready to crash headfirst into eternity? Is this a new sexual orientation?</p> \n\n<p>Now I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t need any more proof that everything is fucked up and on the way to the crapper. All roads lead to shit. That, I think, is one thing everyone can agree to. The bedrock of civilized conversation. So that&#8217;s why I skipped that part. Maybe it&#8217;s a hundred years, maybe two hundred. It&#8217;s hard to imagine more. Most likely much less, more like fifteen or two, but what do I know? After whatever, eternity. The difference is the difference of a blink of an eye. Anyway, what I want to ask is, is that okay with you?</p> \n\n<p>Now before you get your knickers in a twist let me just say I am not trying to get you to do anything you don&#8217;t want to do. I&#8217;m not going to say, &#8220;it&#8217;s all going to shit unless&#8230;&#8221; Unless..? No, buddy. I don&#8217;t think there is an &#8220;unless&#8221;. Disabuse yourself of that &#8220;unless&#8221;. We&#8217;re headed for the crapper. Period, full stop.</p> \n\n<p>Don&#8217;t believe me? Still of the what-me-worry persuasion? How about alternative fuels? If we are gobbling down energy of any kind we will burn hydrocarbons. If nobody is using them they will be cheap. Laws won&#8217;t stop deep-state people from finding a way to make a buck. And poverty makes laws disappear. In industrial civilization we always want more&#8211; vacations, houses, cars, entertainment. And industrial civilization needs to sell us more. Chug all the alternative fuels you want, we will still want more. We will fight for more and so need armies, navies and cyber-warriors. Militaries will use hydrocarbons and fuck you if you don&#8217;t like it. If it&#8217;s there we will use it. Industrial civilization always needs more. Only the end of industrial civilization will end hydrocarbon burning and that ain&#8217;t happening, buster. No, babe, the rock has begun to roll. It would take an absolute all-out mobilization of the entire species in a unified well-organized crash-course of action to eliminate industrial civilization without blowing up the world to give the planet even the ghost of a chance of a snowball in a steaming pile of shit. So that all-out effort will almost certainly fail. I hope that&#8217;s not too alarmist.</p> \n\n<p>So no, I don&#8217;t expect you to do anything, Buddy. Put your mind to rest. The planet is barbecuing, shit is spreading, people are getting upset, and the deep-state is doubling down in order to pursue an astonishingly stupid mind-fuck of world-domination, &#8212; unless they don&#8217;t exist in which case nobody is steering the fucking bus. Put it all together and it spells bye-bye.</p> \n\n<p>Hey, know what? Every deep-state guy, if he exists, is pursuing a sub-rosa scheme to feather a tropical-island bolt-hole nest a la Saddam. A comfy little hidey-hole for our bird-brained leaders. They plan to skip out and lay low in style when whatever hits the whatever. Maybe you can flap your way to one of those with them? Kiss the right ass and win a trip to cloud-cuckoo land. When the champagne runs out and they scamper aboard their jets maybe you can hitch a ride as drink steward or just stow away like a bed bug.</p> \n\n<p>Of course that won&#8217;t last long. In the end you just dry up into a parasite&#8217;s remains, the fossil of an exoskeleton. Is that what you want, Buddy? To end up as a kind of parasitic remains? This, I admit, is what I am worried about. You, Buddy, you! Buddy, you&#8217;re not a tapeworm. You&#8217;re better than that. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to make this all-out last-ditch effort even if it is, in all likelihood, futile? Wouldn&#8217;t that be a better, a nobler way to go than sucking blood til the earth runs dry! Killing people, destroying cities, fucking up every place you are not? So if you think it would be a good idea to make this effort, it might be worthwhile to ask just what this effort would entail.

The organization and other consumer groups opposed the request, saying it could make food less safe and pose risks to meat plant workers, who already deal with higher rates of injury than other industries. The union says it remains \"concerned\" that the USDA plans to let some chicken plants apply to run processing lines at speeds up to 175 birds a minute, with most currently capped at 140.

USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service says the chicken industry group's Sept. 1 petition to eliminate speed limits in chicken plants didn't demonstrate that inspectors could effectively check each carcass for safety at speeds beyond 175 birds a minute--nearly three chickens a second. But FSIS said that the agency plans to lay out criteria for poultry plants, most of which are limited to processing 140 chickens each minute, to run at speeds up to 175, as long as they demonstrate how they will assess food safety and meet other criteria.

That and his power position in the House earn him high marks from the National Rifle Association. In 1993-94, the NRA spent more than $4.7 million to help the Republicans take over Congress. And no other member of the House owes as much to the gun group as Barr. The NRA hand-picked him for the primary and then, in a move motivated by revenge, helped him defeat veteran Democrat Buddy Darden in November.</p> \n\n<p>Early in 1994, when Barr began his run for Congress, the NRA provided his campaign with critical support and worked closely with him to get out the vote, knowing that with the low turnout expected for the off-year primary, it could make the difference. The Georgia Gun Owners&#8217; PAC, which received funds from the NRA, also threw its support behind Barr and provided $5,000 in crucial money for the primary race. Barr won handily.</p> \n\n<p>The NRA put $4,950 more into Barr&#8217;s campaign coffers when he moved on to face Darden in the general election. During his 11 previous years in Congress, Darden had enjoyed the NRA&#8217;s backing. But not this time. Darden, annoyed at the organization&#8217;s backroom maneuvering, had voted for the president&#8217;s 1994 crime bill, which included the assault weapons ban. &#8220;The NRA decided to make an example of Buddy Darden, as a warning to others,&#8221; says a leading Democratic strategist in Georgia. (A similar scenario played out in Texas, where <a href=\"/news/special_reports/1996/09/stockman.html\" type=\"external\">Steve Stockman</a> defeated Rep. Jack Brooks, a longtime NRA friend.)</p> \n\n<p>The NRA backed Barr&#8217;s campaign even though he seemed vulnerable on the &#8220;character&#8221; issue. Married three times and embroiled in a messy court battle with his second wife over his failure to pay child support, Barr had been photographed in 1992 licking whipped cream off two buxom young women&#8217;s chests. And this from the man who would later sponsor the Defense of Marriage Act.</p> \n\n<p>But with the support of a far-right coalition including elements of the NRA, the John Birch Society, the Christian Coalition, and the National Right to Life Committee, Barr won the election with 52 percent of the vote. The payoff for the NRA came in early 1995, when Newt Gingrich appointed a task force to examine firearms legislation. At the NRA&#8217;s urging, the speaker named Barr to head the task force.</p> \n\n<p>Barr&#8217;s agenda is unabashedly pro-NRA. He proposes abolishing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and revoking the Brady Bill that requires waiting periods for the purchase of handguns. This summer he stumped for a bill that eliminated funding for research at the Centers for Disease Control on gun-related fatalities. &#8220;[The CDC has] not eradicated disease,&#8221; said Barr. &#8220;They have work left to do.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Most importantly, he engineered the March 22 House vote repealing the ban on semiautomatic assault weapons. &#8220;It was Bob Barr&#8217;s job to get it done, and he did,&#8221; says <a href=\"/news/feature/1996/07/dreyfuss.html\" type=\"external\">Neal Knox</a>, the NRA&#8217;s first vice president.</p> \n\n<p>Three times, Barr charged up the Hill to push the repeal vote. He managed to get a vote scheduled for May 1995, but it was taken off the agenda after the Oklahoma City bombing. Last fall, Barr organized more than 100 of his colleagues, Democrats as well as Republicans, to repeal the ban. But his effort got lost in the furor over the 1996 budget.</p> \n\n<p>Finally, in early March this year, Barr had lined up enough House members to force a vote. With only two hours scheduled for debate, and no committee hearings, the bill passed 239-173. Sixty-eight out of 86 House freshmen voted to repeal the ban.</p> \n\n<p>Tanya Metaksa, executive director of the NRA&#8217;s political arm, told Mother Jones, &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t the task force that got the vote scheduled. It was Bob. He convinced his colleagues in the Republican Caucus to do it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Uzi does it", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/1996/09/uzi-does-it/", "published_at": "2018-09-01", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>A federal district court in El Paso, Texas, accepted many of the Government&#8217;s arguments, not allowing certain evidence in the case of Luis Posada Carriles to be made public.&amp;#160; Posada is scheduled for trial on perjury charges in March of 2010.</p> \n\n<p>The Judge imposed a protective order on part of the evidence that will be used at trial.&amp;#160; Specifically, Judge Kathleen Cardone ordered a protective seal around tapes and transcriptions that journalist Ann Louise Bardach made in the course of interviewing Posada Carriles in 1998 concerning terrorist actions that he masterminded the previous year.</p> \n\n<p>The judge&#8217;s decision, is incredibly, and based on the journalist&#8217;s right to &#8220;sell her material and she is entitled to the proceeds of that sale.&#8221;&amp;#160; The Court concluded that &#8220;Ms. Bardach should not . . . lose control over that material.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The economic interests of a journalist to sell her tape recordings, or a book based on those recordings, ought not take precedence over the public&#8217;s right to know, as well as the rights of the families affected by the terrorist acts to review the evidence.&amp;#160; This decision is a sad reflection of what is truly most important in this society:&amp;#160; business above all else.</p> \n\n<p>Fabio DiCelmo, the young Italian that Posada brutally murdered in Havana on September 4, 1997, left behind a family that grieves his absence:&amp;#160; Giustino and Ora, his parents, as well as Livio his brother.&amp;#160; They, and also the public, ought not have to await the publication of a book that they would subsequently have to purchase in order to review the taped interviews of Posada Carriles.</p> \n\n<p>During all of the legal vicissitudes that we will come across in the coming months relating to the trial of Posada Carriles in El Paso, we must not lose sight that the terrorist has 73 counts of first degree murder pending in Caracas in relation to the downing of a passenger plane.</p> \n\n<p>The charges that are pending against Posada in Caracas are much more serious than those pending in El Paso.&amp;#160; Perjury is a poor substitute for 73 counts of first degree murder, and a murder prosecution ought take precedence.</p> \n\n<p>The Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Illicit Acts for the Protection of Civil Aviation, signed in Montreal in 1971, obligates Washington to try Posada in the United States for 73 counts of first degree murder, if it decides not to extradite him.</p> \n\n<p>Posada Carriles is an international fugitive from justice.&amp;#160; He fled from a Venezuelan prison to escape justice.&amp;#160; If it does not extradite him to Venezuela, the United States is legally obligated to prosecute him for the downing of the plane.&amp;#160; Why doesn&#8217;t Washington abide by its obligations under international law?&amp;#160; This is the heart of the matter.</p> \n\n<p>JOS&#201; PERTIERRA represents the government of Venezuela in the extradition case against Luis Posada Carriles.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "A Decision in the Posada Case", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2009/08/28/a-decision-in-the-posada-case/", "published_at": "2009-08-28", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Sarah Palin&#8217;s Katie Couric interviews have made her look like a goofball, but maybe that was the idea.

Slurring millions of people as rapists, terrorists and freeloaders, Donald Trump promised, along with the infamous wall on the southern border and a ban of Muslims, tens of thousands of deportations and the seizure of money that people in the US send to families in Mexico. Distressing as all of this is in itself, it&#8217;s coming after years that have already seen many, many family-severing deportations and a struggle to enact reforms.</p> \n\n<p>So what now? Joining us to talk about what&#8217;s needed and what&#8217;s being done is Kica Matos, director of immigrant rights and racial justice at the Center for Community Change. She joins us by phone from Connecticut. Welcome to CounterSpin, Kica Matos.</p> \n\n<p>Kica Matos: Thank you for having me.</p> \n\n<p>JJ: Let me ask you first: Some are saying&#8212;I think wishfully&#8212;oh, he can&#8217;t possibly do everything he talked about. But the array of harms that a Trump presidency represents for immigrant communities, undocumented and documented, should not be minimized. What is your initial response when people ask you, what now?</p> \n\n<p>KM: So I think a couple of things. One is there is a cautious optimism amongst some of my progressive friends who think that Trump really was engaged in a campaign to win and to win at all costs, and he stoked the fires of bigotry and racism in order to win, and they think that he will, as president, be a different person. I can tell you right now that that is not the case when it comes to immigration.</p> \n\n<p>If you look at his hundred-day plan, he intends in a very short amount of time to defund sanctuary cities; to repeal the relief that was extended to young people, so that they will be subject to deportation; he wants to build his notorious wall between the US and Mexico; and, finally, he intends to deport what he calls &#8220;undocumented immigrants with criminal histories,&#8221; though &#8220;criminal histories&#8221; are as yet undefined, but that is a very significant number of people. So the &#8220;what now&#8221; for us is to mount a formidable defense, and to do everything we can to stop him at the local, state and national level.</p> \n\n<p>JJ: Well, let me draw you out on one point. Because I have seen already some stories with a kind of tone of relief: Oh, if he&#8217;s just going to deport the criminals&#8230;. You know, we see this also with welfare policy, people looking&#8212;liberals, you know&#8212;for policy that would punish bad poor people but help good poor people. There&#8217;s something very dangerous in itself about this attempt at division, and then the push to legitimize a crime-focused approach to immigration policy in general.</p> \n\n<p>KM: That&#8217;s right. And I&#8217;ll say a couple of things. One is, they are finding it very difficult to defend their number of 2.5 to 3 million people who they believe to be in this country as undocumented with some kind of criminal history. So we think that A) this number is made up and B) that as they move forward with their deportation machinery, that they&#8217;re really going to go after people with misdemeanors or people, for example, who will get pulled over because of a pretextual broken headlight. And one of what we call the architects of hate, Kris Kobach, has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/kris-kobach-trump-immigration-231430\" type=\"external\">already said</a> that in a situation like that, they don&#8217;t plan to adjudicate the case. So if you get pulled over with a broken headlight or some minor infraction, their intention, once they find out you&#8217;re undocumented, is to deport you.</p> \n\n<p>But it is this dangerous narrative that they&#8217;re moving forward to facilitate the deportation of millions, because if we demonize immigrants and we call them criminals, then I think they&#8217;re betting on Americans feeling this great sense of ease that, well, look at that, we&#8217;re getting rid of the, quote unquote, &#8220;bad immigrant.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>And it creates, also, this dynamic amongst the immigrant community that is very uncomfortable for many, where the good immigrant gets saved and the bad immigrant gets targeted for actual deportation. And that&#8217;s a narrative that people feel very uncomfortable with, given the fact that they are playing fast and loose with what their definition of a &#8220;criminal&#8221; undocumented immigrant is.</p> \n\n<p>JJ: And it almost goes without saying &#8212; and that&#8217;s why, I guess, you have to say it &#8212; the conversation and the coverage of immigration is very racially coded. You know, we aren&#8217;t talking about immigrants from Belgium, for example.</p> \n\n<p>KM: Uh-huh. When Trump talks about undocumented immigrants, he&#8217;s talking about Latinos, and he targets in particular Mexicans, right? To him, Mexicans are the epitome of the vile immigrant. They&#8217;re brown and they are repulsive to him, and so he had no problem calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals that he had no problem demonizing. It is very clear to us that race is at the bottom of his immigration policy, because when he or his peers talk about the undocumented, they don&#8217;t refer, for example, to his wife, who at one point in time was undocumented in the United States. They don&#8217;t refer to the undocumented who are from Ireland or Eastern Europe or any other European country. When they refer to undocumented immigrants, and they demonize these undocumented immigrants, they are talking about brown and black people.</p> \n\n<p>JJ: Well, I see limits even in possibly sympathetic coverage. For example, I&#8217;m seeing praise heaped on the Los Angeles Police Department for saying that they aren&#8217;t going to work with federal law enforcement to enforce immigration policy, that they won&#8217;t randomly ask brown people to show their papers. And while I think that&#8217;s good, it seems like kind of a low bar.</p> \n\n<p>KM: The reality is when the immigration authorities decide to move forward with deportation under Trump, the low-hanging fruit, as you say, are going to be brown people&#8212;brown people like me, I&#8217;m a Latino&#8212;and I think there&#8217;s going to be a lot of racism that&#8217;s going to advance the enforcement machinery: pretextual stops, stop and frisk, racial profiling. The Trump administration is already saying that they&#8217;re going to go after undocumented immigrants and anybody who surrounds them. So if they&#8217;re looking for John Smith, and you happen to be next to John Smith and you are brown, they will come after you as well if you can&#8217;t show your papers. So this to us is a very intentional effort to malign and demonize people of color in this country.</p> \n\n<p>And so it behooves sanctuary cities, and cities who care about their communities, to do everything they can to protect them. Because these policies will not just affect those targeted, it will affect entire communities. I think it will come as no surprise that we live mostly&#8212;except for, you know, gerrymandered districts&#8212;in multi-racial communities. And those of us who do live in multi-racial communities will wake up one day and see our next-door neighbors taken away.</p> \n\n<p>We&#8217;ll go to our church and wonder what happened to that family, and we will learn that that family was deported. We will see acts of terror in public spaces, in houses, in places where people work. And so I think it behooves all of us to wrap our arms around our communities, and it behooves city officials and state officials to mount a control wall &#8212; talking about walls &#8212; good strong walls to protect their residents from the terror that Trump and his administration intends to unleash in a few months.</p> \n\n<p>JJ: Are sanctuary cities &#8212; I&#8217;ve been very interested to hear cities proclaiming themselves, or underscoring that they are, sanctuary cities. Does that have a legal underpinning, or is that a statement of an intention and policy? How tough is that?</p> \n\n<p>KM: Yeah, so, the understood definition of sanctuary city is any city that refuses to carry out the law enforcement job of immigration and customs enforcement. There were efforts under Obama with 287(g) and Secure Communities to encourage local law enforcement to carry out the mandate of immigration and customs enforcement, to advance deportation. Many cities resisted. When people talk about sanctuary cities, a lot of the time they&#8217;re really referring to the refusal of local communities to carry out deportation policies for the federal government.</p> \n\n<p>But more broadly, sanctuary cities are understood as places that protect the undocumented immigrant and provide a haven for them and provide the opportunity for immigrants, irrespective of their status, to be welcomed, to be productive citizens in their respective communities, and to engage in the civic life of the cities.</p> \n\n<p>So if you look at some of the anti-immigrant organizations, Center for Immigrant Studies has a broader definition of sanctuary city, where they define sanctuary cities as any city that is friendly towards immigrants. So where I live, for example, New Haven, Connecticut, it&#8217;s considered a sanctuary city under their definition, because the city implemented a program to offer city identification cards to any resident of the city, irrespective of their status. So if you go by that broader definition, there are hundreds of sanctuary cities in the United States, and many of them are already engaged in acts of defiance, publicly letting the federal government know that they will do absolutely everything they can to protect immigrants in their communities.</p> \n\n<p>JJ: Let me just ask you, finally, is there anything that you think reporters could be doing more of or less of in these difficult times, particularly with regard to coverage of, not just the White House moves on immigration, but on the status of immigrant communities generally?</p> \n\n<p>KM: I have seen the damage that happens in communities when aggressive deportation policies are carried out. And let me just be really clear about something: They traumatize families, they traumatize communities, and they rip apart the fabric of whatever community, whatever city these deportations are carried out in. I think that journalists should tell those stories. When they hear of deportations, and they hear of raids being carried out in whatever community they&#8217;re in, I would encourage them to cover those stories, interview the families that are impacted, talk to community members.</p> \n\n<p>Because I want to believe, despite the outcome of the election, that most Americans care about justice, that most Americans really want to live up to the ideals of our democracy. And the kind of vision and future that Donald Trump sees for Americans, I want to believe, is not what Americans want at the end of the day. The average length of stay here, the median stay for undocumented immigrants, is 15 years, so we are talking about people who have made their lives in this country.</p> \n\n<p>Many undocumented immigrants live in what is known as mixed status families, so there are many instances of undocumented parents with US citizen kids. So when that deportation machinery starts revving up, I want reporters to talk about those US citizen kids who are orphaned because of the horrifying policies that our government is choosing to carry out.</p> \n\n<p>JJ: We&#8217;ve been speaking with Kica Matos.

He soon clarified his comment, suggesting that women who get abortions should not be penalized. But most recently, he doubled down on his initial statement.</p> \n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the chronology: During an interview with MSNBC&#8217;s Chris Matthews last Wednesday, Trump said that abortion should be banned and that &#8220; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">there has to be some form of punishment</a>&#8221; for women who obtain abortions once they are outlawed. Faced with immediate <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/30/politics/donald-trump-abortion-town-hall/\" type=\"external\">criticism</a> from both anti-abortion and pro-abortion rights groups, his campaign issued a statement saying that Trump believed that only the abortion provider, not the woman, should be held legally responsible.</p> \n\n<p>But a few days later, on Saturday, Trump essentially reaffirmed his initial comments. His answer to Matthews&#8217; question was &#8220;excellent,&#8221; Trump told talk radio host Joe Pags, in an interview <a href=\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/donald-trump-defends-call-punishing-women-who-have-abortions-i-didnt-see-any-big-deal\" type=\"external\">flagged</a> on Tuesday by the liberal website Right Wing Watch. Here&#8217;s the exchange:</p> \n\n<p>TRUMP: A lot of people thought my answer was excellent, by the way. There were a lot of people who thought that was a very good answer. It was a hypothetical question. I didn&#8217;t see any big deal and then all of a sudden there was somewhat of a storm. And you know, it&#8217;s interesting, this morning I&#8217;m hearing two hosts on television that were critical and they said, &#8220;We really thought his first answer was very good.&#8221; Because you can&#8217;t win. &#8220;We thought it was good, what was wrong with his first answer?&#8221; And I heard a pastor, who is a fantastic pastor, saying, &#8220;Well, you know, if you think about it, his first answer was right&#8221;&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>PAGS: Well, your answer was consistent with conservatism but Chris Matthews has an agenda, so I&#8217;m not even wondering about the question because I thought it was loaded and stupid and hypothetical.</p> \n\n<p>TRUMP: It was disgraceful.</p> \n\n<p>PAGS: Why go on the show? Why go?</p> \n\n<p>TRUMP: I heard people defending it today. Now they defend it. Now they say, &#8220;It was really right.&#8221; The whole thing is just so&#8212;look, the press is extremely unfair.</p> \n\n<p>Trump, though, was not done with this subject. The next day, he had yet another position on abortion. He appeared on CBS&#8217;s Face the Nation and stated that the current law on abortion should not be changed. Once again, his campaign had to renovate his message. It quickly <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-dont-change-abortion-laws/\" type=\"external\">walked back</a> this statement, asserting that Trump meant the law will remain the same &#8220;until he is President.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Trump Says His Controversial Comment About Abortion Was \u201cExcellent\u201d", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/trump-abortion-comment-punish-women-excellent/", "published_at": "2016-04-05", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>A new video produced by Campus Reform interviews a few college students to find out how they feel about Antifa and their violent tactics. The results are not surprising for those who've been watching what's taken place on college campuses in recent months.</p> \n\n<p>Over the last year, the social justice left on campuses across the country has increasingly used violence and disruption to suppress speech they deem offensive &#8212; messages that do not align with their ideological and political agenda. The situation has been exacerbated by social justice-sympathizing administrations empowering the radical \"activists\" by disempowering law enforcement.</p> \n\n<p>But what is most troubling is that these anti-free speech beliefs and tactics are not simply embraced by a radical fringe. A recent <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Brookings Institute study</a> found that a majority of students believe that disrupting speakers to silence them is \"acceptable\" and one in five students (19%) endorse the use of violence to silence an \"offensive\" speaker. A plurality of students believe that \"hate speech\" is not covered by the First Amendment, despite Supreme Court precedent establishing otherwise.</p> \n\n<p>As a follow-up to the Brookings' study, Campus Reform decided to hit the campus greens to talk in person with some students to see if they really do endorse violence and those leading the violence, Antifa. All of the students the video features say they have a generally \"positive\" view of Antifa, and most of them say they believe violence against \"fascists\" is justified and can be a useful \"tool\" for pushing back against \"hate.\"</p> \n\n<p>\"I like them,\" one student says of Antifa. \"Beating up fascists is good.\"</p> \n\n<p>One student says that her impression of Antifa is good because she only sees them marching next to her and \"standing for what I believe in.\" Another says she sees them \"more on the positive side because they're combating hate.\"</p> \n\n<p>\"I think that a lot of them are trying to educate,\" says one student.</p> \n\n<p>\"A lot of people say that they're creating more hate,\" says a female student, \"but I think if you're combating hate then it automatically makes you more on the positive side.\"</p> \n\n<p>When one male is asked directly if violence is sometimes justified, he replies, \"Absolutely.

The company will report its results for the quarter on Thursday, Oct. 26, after market close.</p> \n\n<p>Ahead of Alphabet's third-quarter report, here's an early look at three areas investors may want to check in on after the update: revenue growth, Alphabet's \"Google other\" segment, and its \"other bets\" segment.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>For Alphabet's third quarter, analysts' consensus estimate&amp;#160;for revenue is $27.2 billion. This compares to revenue of $22.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, representing about a 21% increase.</p> \n\n<p>The analysts' consensus estimate seems well founded, given that Alphabet's revenue in its second quarter was similarly up 21% year over year.</p> \n\n<p>Alphabet's strong revenue growth recently continues to demonstrate the search giant's ability to consistently grow its business at heady rates. In its second quarter, management said its&amp;#160;solid top line was <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/07/25/alphabet-inc-earnings-5-metrics-you-shouldnt-overl.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=72b890f2-a54a-11e7-b600-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">primarily driven Opens a New Window.</a> by strong Google advertising revenue growth in mobile search and on YouTube. Alphabet's Google advertising revenue accounts for 87%&amp;#160;of Alphabet's total revenue. The segment revenue was up 18% year over year.</p> \n\n<p>Investors should look for strong advertising growth to similarly help drive Alphabet's top line in Q3.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Made up primarily of revenue from the Android app store, Google-branded hardware, and cloud services, Alphabet's \"Google other\" segment is becoming increasingly important to the company's results. In Alphabet's second quarter, other revenue was up 42% year over year. Further, other revenue accounted for a notable 12% of second-quarter revenue, up from 10% in the year-ago quarter.</p> \n\n<p>Can Alphabet's Google other segment keep up this strong growth in Q3?</p> \n\n<p>Not to be consumed with Google other revenue, which falls under the company's Google reporting segment, Alphabet's \"other bets\" segment represents a much smaller portion of the company. It's where Alphabet files its \"moonshot\" projects like Nest, Verily, Fiber, and its self-driving car company <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/12/14/alphabet-incs-self-driving-car-project-becomes-a-c.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=72b890f2-a54a-11e7-b600-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Waymo Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>In Alphabet's second quarter, other-bets revenue represented only a fraction of the company's total top line -- at less than 1%. The segment is growing rapidly. Second-quarter other-bets revenue climbed 34% year over year.</p> \n\n<p>But it's not the growth of Alphabet's other bets segment that investors should be keeping an eye on. Rather, investors should be watching how quickly Alphabet can reduce the segment's massive operating losses. In Alphabet's second quarter, other bets' operating loss was $772 million, weighing meaningfully on overall profitability.</p> \n\n<p>Fortunately, Alphabet has made progress recently on improving its other bets operating losses. In Alphabet's second quarter, other bets $772 million operating loss was narrower than the segment's $855 million operating loss in the year-ago quarter. Further, Alphabet's other bets operating losses are improving rapidly on a sequential basis lately, narrowing from $1.088 billion&amp;#160;in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $855 million in the first quarter of 2017.</p> \n\n<p>Investors should look for Alphabet's other bets operating loss to continue to improve on both a year-over-year and sequential basis in Q3.</p> \n\n<p>Overall, investors should look for Alphabet's results to continue highlighting the strength of its search business while also showing promising signs in its smaller segments.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A country that wants to declare the cow as the mother of the nation and where minorities have to prove their patriotism not by allegiance to the flag but to the political party in power is bound to descend into chaos.</p> \n\n<p>Two years ago, a mob brandishing hockey sticks and knives barged into Mohammed Akhlaq&#8217;s house in Dadri in north India and assaulted all the family members before killing him because they suspected there was beef in their fridge. The meat was sent to the forensic lab and it was found to be lamb.</p> \n\n<p>When one of his killers <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">died</a> (of natural causes), he was given a martyr&#8217;s funeral; his coffin was draped in the national flag and there were speeches by leaders from Hindu organisations that have direct access to the government.</p> \n\n<p>Last month towards the end of Ramadan when Junaid boarded the train to return home with his Eid shopping bags, he might not have imagined that the elderly man whom he offered the seat to would egg on a mob punching him and his friends. Abuses flew. &#8220;Beef eater&#8221;, &#8220;antinational&#8221;, &#8220;mullah&#8221;. They pulled at their skull caps and newly-sprouted beards. Knives came out telling them to go to Pakistan. They were bleeding. Nobody came to their rescue. Junaid was stabbed. He died. He was 16. At the stations en route some of the lynch mob got off, enough to let the cops shrug about little evidence.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">A scuffle</a> for seats got transformed into a fight for political and religious space. Or, perhaps, religious assertiveness is seeking out reasons.</p> \n\n<p>Meat trader Alimuddin Ansari was beaten up by a mob and his van, ostensibly with cattle meat, was set on fire in Jharkhand. There seemed to have been a dispute with some people who were extorting money from him. Such excuses have become the norm where the victim is invariably Muslim, for it was not a spontaneous act. His movements were tracked for hours before he was murdered.</p> \n\n<p>Mohammad Majloom and Inayatullah Khan of Latehar were taking their cattle to a fair many miles away. Five men with a mission waylaid them. After they killed the 35 and 13 year old, they tied a noose around their necks and hung them from a tree.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Prima facie it appears to have been a case of a gang attempting to loot cattle,&#8221; the cops said. For those in a hurry to rob and make a quick escape with the cattle to profit from it, they seemed to have relished in committing the murders. Not only did they kill the two, they hanged them. The hanging was a message. To shame. To hold them up as an example. How dare they not respect their gau mata, the cow mother, their religion?</p> \n\n<p>It is disconcerting that mobs are using cow protection as the higher cause even to settle petty disputes. The shaming has got a further boost because the videos are uploaded and shared. The message gets more traction. What is so evident in these viral videos is that the so-called &#8216;jihadi mentality&#8217; that Muslims are accused of does not respond in kind. The victims are just&amp;#160;overwhelmed by the suddenness of the attack; in some instances they are&amp;#160;pleading, in one the man does not even have the energy or presence of&amp;#160;mind to protest as they grab his hair and kick him. He just takes it like a&amp;#160;stoic who has become accustomed to lie on a bed of nails.</p> \n\n<p>***</p> \n\n<p>Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, has not uttered a word condoling any of these deaths. He tweets mourning for the loss of lives in a fire in Portugal, but makes no attempt to reach out to the families of those killed by men purportedly supporting his party&#8217;s Hindutva dream, a dream to reclaim ancient India and transform the country into a Hindu nation.</p> \n\n<p>When he does <a href=\"https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/strict-action-will-be-taken-against-cow-vigilante-groups-says-pm-modi/299582\" type=\"external\">speak</a>, it is evasive: &#8220;All (state) governments should take stringent action against those who are violating law in the name of cow protection.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>How will this happen when some state governments are handing out expensive beef detection kits to the cops to smell for trouble, effectively converting the police force into cow protectors too? The very fact that there are several cow protection groups is worrying, for they aren&#8217;t animal rights activists but soldiers of the faith.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Bolo Jai Shri Ram&#8221; (Hail Lord Rama), is the war cry. People are stopped in the streets and asked to owe allegiance to their god. A mentally unstable woman was slapped and forced to utter the words; a cleric was pummelled just outside the mosque by a group insisting he chant the phrase; <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/was-forced-to-say-jai-sri-ram-by-bajrang-dal-activists-claims-ndtv-journalist-4731743/\" type=\"external\">journalist Munne Bharti</a> was driving with his elderly parents. Suddenly, their car was surrounded by a group. They threatened to set the car on fire if they did not chant &#8220;Jai Shri Ram&#8221;. They did. An adult was frightened, for himself and his aged parents.</p> \n\n<p>***</p> \n\n<p>How is this not about religion, then?</p> \n\n<p>It was always about religion, perhaps by a few skewed minds.&amp;#160;25 years ago Bal Thackeray, the leader of the militant Shiv Sena, had asked for the disenfranchisement of Muslims. He would address huge rallies at an open ground referring to Muslims as &#8220;katuas&#8221;, the cut ones without a foreskin. After the Babri Masjid was demolished in Ayodhya, on the instructions of these political parties, and the riots reached what was then Bombay, the men in the streets would point at the crotches of Muslim men and snigger, &#8220;katua&#8221;. They were stopped and asked to strip for a random check by random people. Unlike the Sikhs after the riots in 1984 who discarded their turbans and shaved off their hair to protect themselves, Muslims could not get back their foreskin.</p> \n\n<p>At the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">All-India Hindu Convention</a>&amp;#160;held last month in Goa, for 4 days all the cars at the venue were sprayed with cow urine to purify them. &#8220;Their car needs shuddhi karan. We do it to all objects &#8212; watches, clothes, sometimes even handbags. It&#8217;s a spiritual exercise.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>How people choose to practise their faith is a personal matter. But when you have a cow piss soda, cow dung and urine being made a part of ayurvedic medicines and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">astrologers treating people</a> in hospital OPDs, then it becomes obvious that the cow and beef are incidental here. They are only the more potent batons to beat the minorities. There is also the commercial angle. Giving a charlatan guru called Ramdev land and business rights to run an empire ostensibly selling indigenous products is a strategy to bring the devil close to your home.</p> \n\n<p>Young Hindu women are <a href=\"http://zeenews.india.com/news/uttar-pradesh/love-jihadis-beware-hindu-girls-being-prepared-to-fight-forced-religious-conversion-in-aligarh_1896121.html\" type=\"external\">training in self-defence</a> to protect them from &#8220;love jihad&#8221;, a bogey created by the rightwing suggesting that Muslim men are luring them to fall in love to later convert them.</p> \n\n<p>In May last year, there was a report about a <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bajrang-dal-imparts-military-training-to-cadre-to-fight-terror/1/675774.html\" type=\"external\">camp</a> in Uttar Pradesh training the youth wing of militant Hindu organisations to protect the country from terrorists. In the video images they are aiming their air guns and sticks at men wearing skull caps. The governor had justified the drill: &#8220;Those who cannot defend themselves, cannot ultimately defend the country and there is nothing wrong if some youths are getting arms-training purely for self defence.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>That instead of urging these fit youth to join the army, they are being brainwashed to target a particular group makes the intention clear. How is this not about religion?</p> \n\n<p>***</p> \n\n<p>The fallout of such brainwashing is not restricted to the extremist Hindutva proponents alone. There is a not-so-subtle attempt to deflect from the Hinduness of the terror by liberals too. An academic who has taken it upon himself to explain India to Indians on social media from his perch in the US has <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">written</a> about the global Muslim victimhood industry by playing victim: &#8220;One cannot use the term &#8216;Muslim terror&#8217; (but Hindu or Christian or Left terror is fine) or even Islamic terror without worry of being termed communal, bigoted, or Islamophobic. The appropriate phrase is &#8216;Islamist terror,&#8217; which, we are expected to clarify, has nothing to do with Islam.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Some commentators have begun to call India Lynchistan, the land of lynching. We do not seem to realise that mobs thrive on notoriety. They are not seeking a popular mandate, because they already are the popular mandate. Paper tiger responses only embolden their cause. The truth is that nobody in mainstream media or in activism or with an outsider&#8217;s perspective, like <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Dr. Amartya Sen</a>, has had the courage or the will to call these planned lynchings as Hindu terrorism.</p> \n\n<p>Is such nomenclature important? It is. Because it is a systematic attempt to annihilate the minorities, specifically Muslims. (Quite different from Islamist terrorism whose victims are mainly Muslim and, in some cases like the ISIS&#8217;s victims, also people who are liberal enough to support Muslims.)</p> \n\n<p>Muslims immediately distance themselves from any jihad violence, even though that does not assuage their neighbours from seeing them as potential suspects. Hindus are not doing so in large enough numbers, and they are chary of admitting the faith angle because they believe that Hinduism is not a monotheistic faith with allegiance to one book and one god. It is amorphous and therefore fluid, they reason.</p> \n\n<p>The caste system and its treatment of Dalits and the backward castes certainly reveals &#8216;fluidity&#8217;. All the government-engineered riots have been masterminded by a vile intellect that outsources the war to the police and army and pumps up the trading class to decimate minority businesses. The murder of minorities is only a more violent assertion of this sheltered ghettoisation of the elite majority.</p> \n\n<p>There are many who use their internet liberalism to rationalise their own subtle bigotry. That many of them also have a stake in steak does lend weight to their public &#8220;I&#8217;m not too Hindu&#8221; utterances.</p> \n\n<p>In one such recent piece, the headline <a href=\"http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/bloody-mary/is-the-hindu-a-victim-no-hindus-feel-safe-and-the-victim-narrative-is-a-manufactured-war-cry/\" type=\"external\">flashed</a> about how Hindu victimhood is a manufactured cry. In the first para itself, though, the writer gave a clean chit to Muslims quoting, of all people, George Bush: &#8220;India is a country which does not have a single al-Qaida member in a population of 150 million Muslims.&#8221; Hindus do not have to prove whether they have allegiance to any extremist organisation, even if they elect them to power.</p> \n\n<p>The usage of Islamist phrases like fatwa and jihad to explain Hindu terror acts and suggest they are only &#8220;mimicking&#8221; reeks of another version of Islamophobia and projects violence by Hindu extremists as a reaction to centuries of abuse by Muslim rulers. This historic narrative pushes the &#8216;tolerate Muslims despite their past&#8217; idea, the moral compass revealing who considers itself the superior side.</p> \n\n<p>These recent attempts to call out Hindu extremists is not organic. They are a response to some of us wondering why we did not link the Hindu word with terrorism. We have woken up or, in good old Hindu speak, and in deference to many of us being converts from the ancient religion, our third eye has been awakened.</p>", "title": "The Murder of Muslims", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2017/07/21/the-murder-of-muslims/", "published_at": "2017-07-21", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Hello,</p> \n\n<p>My name is Cynthia. I recently graduated with my master's degree and have secured a full-time job in East Palo Alto with a nonprofit working with young people. I have steady income, good references, a 759 credit score and good renter history. I am responsible.</p> \n\n<p>I try to live as healthy as possible. So, I spend a lot of time outside. I don't own a TV. I like to write. I am looking for a long-term space for my daughter and myself. She is 6 years old.</p> \n\n<p>We are looking for a calm space that we can call home. At the moment, we are homeless. It is hard to find someone who is willing to offer us a space. We have a regular early rise type of sleeping schedule. We are very clean individuals and find that organization makes our life easier.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>We try to be as positive as possible and believe in communication first, as long as people are willing. If not, we keep to ourselves.</p> \n\n<p>My daughter will be gone most weekends with her father. Otherwise, she is always by my side. She is well behaved. We have family in Redwood City. So, we spend most of our time there.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Thank you for your time,</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>CLC</p> \n\n<p>This is the introduction that I have been sending out like a robot on a daily basis, in the desperate hope of finding a place to live. I never expected it to be so difficult to find housing in California's Bay Area, especially on the Peninsula, my place of birth and where I grew up.</p> \n\n<p>Throughout the years, I have witnessed the drastic changes that my hometown, Redwood City, has gone through, and I don't know if any of those changes have benefited the individuals in my community, including myself. Since I was 12 years old, I have been engaged within my community by participating in programs and organizations that are rooted in social justice.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The people living in low-income communities of color that are being gentrified deserve to live in the space that we call home, not because we are a needed component of a hierarchy system but because we are human.?</p> \n\n<p>Cynthia Cruz, a Silicon Valley resident</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>I have volunteered and served as a model for young people, who are struggling with the same circumstances that I experienced while growing up as a first-generation, low-income, fatherless, little Brown girl.</p> \n\n<p>Last May, I walked across the stage at San Jose State University and received my third college degree, after navigating the unpaved road of higher education. As the American Dream dictates, I have worked incessantly, bootstraps have permanently scarred my hands. I pull and sustain.</p> \n\n<p>My community has failed me when I have worked to be a productive member of society, but I cannot find a safe space for my family to live. During my search for housing, I have felt completely degraded as a human being. Looking for housing on the Peninsula has turned into a human rights violation.</p> \n\n<p>During my search, I have experienced circumstances that are fundamentally degrading and have made me make sacrifices. I dedicate an average of two hours a day sending out emails, making calls and driving to see spaces. Recently, after taking the time to drive to a potential home, investigating the space and filling out a three-page application, I was told, not to bother applying by a White man.</p> \n\n<p>He did not even make eye contact with me.&amp;#160;He stated that there had already been more than 10 applicants for a $1,500 per month studio without parking or washer and dryer amenities.</p> \n\n<p>At open houses, standing with my daughter in hand, I quickly understood that I could not compete with all of the high-tech, single \"professionals.\" They are always the preferred candidate. With my daughter next to me, I am asked personal questions about my romantic life, my child custody agreement, details about my daily routine - questions that I must answer even with extreme discomfort if I wish to be considered.</p> \n\n<p>My discomfort escalated and morphed into something aberrant on the occasion that I was recorded without my consent. At the end of a conversation with a landlord, she simply tapped her phone, which had been on the table and said, \"I hope we were loud enough. It is so I won't forget anything when I talk to my husband.\"</p> \n\n<p>I concluded that our entire conversation had been recorded. I was never told that our conversation would be recorded. She never asked for consent. I swallowed all of the immediate alarms going off in my head and the dark feeling creeping out of my chest. I simply smiled and said I would wait for her decision about the mini studio.</p> \n\n<p>Two days later, the landlord contacted me to let me know she was willing to rent to me but was asking for $1,650, instead of $1,500 which was the original listing price. I cannot afford to pay $1,650 per month for a mini studio. It is not sustainable for myself and my daughter. My conscience awakens with all of the wrath brought to an ocean by a hurricane, but is abruptly stunted by the desire to be able to tell my daughter that we have a home.</p> \n\n<p>These two incidents reflect my entire experience of trying to search for a home on the Peninsula for my daughter and myself. As an individual working with the public in communities that are violently being displaced, I battle with the monster that is gentrification. Its claws have uprooted open spaces, filled them with concrete and one-way mirrors.</p> \n\n<p>Its teeth have chewed away at all of the affordable housing, leaving it smeared with the shiny saliva of luxury condominiums. It is an uphill battle, when what nourishes this monster is capitalistic greed. We are also consumed, when the mainstream arguments against gentrification revolve around the very same ideas that keeps this monster alive.</p> \n\n<p>\"If all of the low-income people move away who will work in the service jobs?\"</p> \n\n<p>\"Who will keep the Peninsula functioning if there are no blue collar workers?\"</p> \n\n<p>This discourse is located within the framework that creates a situation in which people are literally pushed out of their homes and communities. Gentrification is more than the appropriation of environment - it is about stripping an entire community of a way of life, tradition, history and sustainability.</p> \n\n<p>Gentrification is a symptom of social inequality, which makes social justice the only argument against displacement.</p> \n\n<p>The people living in low-income communities of color that are being gentrified deserve to live in the space that we call home, not because we are a needed component of a hierarchy system but because we are human.</p> \n\n<p>There is a problem when attempting to secure basic survival, comes with the loss of self respect and scrapes down my throat as I swallow in order to provide for my daughter.</p> \n\n<p>I do not strive for luxury served on a silver spoon. I would simply like the basic needs that society assured I would be able to secure if I walked down the directed path. I realize the American Dream will never manifest for me when I open my eyes.</p> \n\n<p>I must imagine my own - a type of dream that is not dehumanizing when I attempt to make it a reality and one that is inclusive of individuals like myself and my daughter.</p> \n\n<p>A version of this essay first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.siliconvalleydebug.org/\" type=\"external\">Silicon Valley De-Bug</a>, a community organizing, advocacy and media <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">organization</a> in San Jose, Calif.

It began losing numbers; unionized jobs disappeared, because of new technology; you had large industrial centers like Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit, sort of dwindle in size; you had charges of corruption against unions, which tended to stick in people&#8217;s minds. And then, of course, you had globalization in the last 15, 20 years, which reduces the leverage that unionized workers have, and so tends to reduce the power of unions generally. And I think they&#8217;ve been cast sort of unfairly as organizations that bargain for generous pensions, and that kind of thing, and then wind up messing up cities&#8217; fiscal situations, or what have you. But you know, I think there&#8217;s been a lot of negative public relations about unions, from various sources; I don&#8217;t think that much of it is really deserved.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: This is Robert Scheer cutting in. Let me just say, what your book captures is the vibrant, robust contribution of trade unions to American democracy. And what has really happened is that the political system, through the work of lobbyists, has been turned against unions. So you can go back to Taft-Hartley and that whole battle, but globalization, all these things didn&#8217;t happen by accident. In your book you talk about Ronald Reagan&#8217;s role, the air traffic controllers issue going back to 1981. So the destruction of unions was not a natural phenomenon.</p> \n\n<p>Philip Dray: Yeah, that&#8217;s a very good point, you know. People have been out to get unions through one means or another for a very long time, whether it was the misuse of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Palmer Raids, what have you, and now this most recent assault, of course, against collective bargaining in Wisconsin and elsewhere.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: You know, speaking of that, I mean, what is so infuriating about this&#8212;the Wall Street Journal on Monday has a big story about how wages are stagnant, this is the wageless recovery. You know, unemployment has gone down to 8.8%, and we&#8217;re supposed to be happy with this, and there&#8217;s a very large number of people who can&#8217;t, have given up looking for jobs, and the people who get jobs are very often getting them below their skill set, below what they had expected. And you have, now, these multinational corporations can move their practices abroad, where they don&#8217;t have taxes to face, and they can take advantage of this reserved army of the unemployed, if you like, to drive wages down. Does this foretell a whole erosion of the American middle class that was built on good-paid jobs?</p> \n\n<p>Philip Dray: Well, I think that&#8217;s already underway. You know, I think that really a lot of people think of the PATCO strike of 1981, when Reagan got rid of all the air traffic controllers in one fell swoop, as kind of the beginning of all that. It certainly ushered in an era when workers were seen as contingent workers, as temps, they could be replaced, and so on. And then of course, again, as you point out, as the power of the corporations goes global, labor just had no way to keep up with that. And so yeah, as a result, you find the labor, you know, work force disenfranchised, in a sense. And of course now, they&#8217;re actually trying to disenfranchise and really kind of deny them some of their most essential, quasi-constitutional rights, really, for collective bargaining.</p> \n\n<p>Josh Scheer: You know, in your book, it&#8217;s not just about Reagan; you go back into the 1870s, and I was wondering about the Tompkins Square Riot. And you talk about riot after riot, and these kind of very vibrant scenes. Is that something that&#8217;s going to be required in the future, do you think? To get unions back, to have more of a, you know, there&#8217;s going to be a battle?</p> \n\n<p>Philip Dray: That&#8217;s a really good question because, you know, if they start taking away collective bargaining rights, it does cast the workers back to the conditions that they were in before collective bargaining. And of course, that&#8217;s what collective bargaining was partly meant to get rid of, to ameliorate, was this sense of working people having no rights, really. And the idea was it was part of the progressive movement of the early 20th century, what they called industrial democracy. It was literally a way to bring workers into the American system, and give them some status, some standing. And so when you take that away, yes of course, you are asking for all kinds of unseen problems.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: You know, it&#8217;s interesting, your book deals with a sort of mythology in America; the self-made person, and why do you need unions. And unions challenge that notion; they say no, it&#8217;s not a level playing field, we have to collectively work for our common rights and so forth. And we&#8217;re in a very odd moment now when you have an economic meltdown that is directly the result of Wall Street policies and government policies purchased by Wall Street, deregulation of the financial industry. And yet the people paying the price for this are unionized, primarily unionized government workers, who are being told they&#8217;ve got to take it in the neck now because of what Wall Street did. And there&#8217;s a disconnect here that the mass media doesn&#8217;t seem to comment on.</p> \n\n<p>Philip Dray: I mean, you&#8217;re right on a couple of accounts there. Of course, there&#8217;s always been that kind of myth of the rugged individual; it has always played against the collective might of unions in America. You know, that&#8217;s always been a factor. And now, you&#8217;re absolutely right of course, it&#8217;s&#8212;you know, I think it&#8217;s almost comical, if it wasn&#8217;t so tragic, that the people who are blamed now are public school teachers&#8212;of all people. Like, of all the stuff that&#8217;s gone on in the last decade, with the corporations and the big banks and whatever, the idea that it&#8217;s the fault of the public schoolteachers, who are pretty &#8230; you know, they&#8217;re a hard-bitten bunch; I mean, they work hard, they have a hard job, they don&#8217;t earn all that much money, whatever. And yeah, I mean, you know, these pensions or whatever they are were negotiated in good faith. Corporations and employers love to give away things over the rainbow, in exchange for lower wages in the near term. So then to come back years later and say, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s your greed that&#8217;s causing all this meltdown,&#8221; yeah, of course, it&#8217;s totally fallacious.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Why did you write a book on labor? I mean, it seems sort of a thankless task. It came out in October of last year. And, you know, we don&#8217;t teach labor history in the schools; newspapers have huge business departments; sometimes they have a labor reporter; rarely, though. And what prompted you to capture this history, and why do you think it&#8217;s important, and why should people read your book?</p> \n\n<p>Philip Dray: Well, again, I think it was something&#8230;a little perverse, I agree. And I remember at the time I thought, &#8220;Gee, a book&#8230; who would even&#8230;&#8221; You know, it was not an easy sell to the publishers, to be perfectly honest. People thought &#8220;Labor history?&#8221; But yeah, I felt&#8230;you know, when you look into it, of course&#8212;you&#8217;re aware of this, I&#8217;m sure a lot of your listeners are, too&#8212;it&#8217;s an enormous history; it involves millions of people, there were all kinds of dramatic episodes and victories and setbacks. So it just seemed kind of ridiculous that it would be forgotten, particularly given the kind of pernicious assaults on unions. And going forward, I believe in the title of my book. I believe there is power in a union, and how that&#8217;ll work out in years ahead, I don&#8217;t know. But I do think, as we see recently with Wisconsin, I do think people will respond; I think people do cherish collective bargaining and other essential rights for working people, and they will collectivize and turn to those, turn to their colleagues when necessary.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Well, let&#8217;s end with a bigger plug for your book than you&#8217;re giving. I think it provides an indispensable point to the current debate that&#8217;s been ignored. The labor unions have been the main way of expanding the middle class, preserving American democracy; you capture that rich history in this book published by Doubleday, and people should go out and buy it.</p> \n\n<p>Philip Dray: Well, thank you for providing more amplitude. [Laughs]&#8230;thank you so much.</p> \n\n<p>Josh Scheer: Well, thank you for joining us, Philip. And again, go out and buy the book, &#8220;There Is Power in a Union.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>* * *Peter Scheer:</p> \n\n<p>Last week, the labor movement could be found on the streets of downtown Los Angeles. We sent Howard Stier to take a look.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: Pershing Square, a vast expanse of concrete in downtown Los Angeles, is where, during the Great Depression, authors Charles Bukowski and John Fante came to take in the pageant of human life. It&#8217;s where crowds gathered in 1960 to catch a glimpse of presidential candidate John Kennedy arriving to accept a nomination at the Democratic National Convention. And it is where thousands of union workers&#8212;truck drivers, movie technicians, farmworkers, and nurses and teachers and janitors rallied last weekend in a show of support for the beleaguered state public workers of Wisconsin. [Indistinct yelling] Timothy Sklekens, a supermarket cashier, motivated unionists from UFCW Local 770, representing food industry workers. You&#8217;re protesting Ralphs, particularly?</p> \n\n<p>Timothy Sklekens: Ralphs is one of the stores, one of the big three, that&#8217;s not negotiating contracts with us. We&#8217;ve had several meetings with them, and they&#8217;re not taking us seriously. We want a decent contract, we want a fair wage. Ralphs, Vons and Albertsons are the big three that we&#8217;re negotiating with now, and we just want a fair contract. We&#8217;re out here to show that we want a fair wage, like everybody else.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: So where does Ralphs come in?</p> \n\n<p>Timothy Sklekens: Right now, they&#8217;re negotiating, trying to [take] away our benefits again, like they do every contract. So we&#8217;re out here to fight it.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: Tim Canova is an attorney and a professor of law at Chapman University in Orange, California, and a consultant to labor organizers. He&#8217;s concerned that an assault on union rights will hinder an economic recovery.</p> \n\n<p>Tim Canova: We have a major jobs crisis, the most severe jobs recession in a century, and unions have to get on board to try to apply a lot of political pressure to create jobs. The private sector&#8217;s not creating them; the whole trend has been for austerity and budget-cutting, and now is not the time to be cutting budgets. Now is the time for the government to step up and to actually have jobs programs.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: Well, with unions, as we saw in Wisconsin, being undercut by legislators, what hope is there other than coming out in the streets?</p> \n\n<p>Tim Canova: Well, there needs to be recalls in places like Wisconsin. Politicians who think that they can just bust public-sector unions and have anti-worker policies have to pay a big price for it. And an immediate price. So the recalls that they&#8217;re now undertaking in Wisconsin&#8212;that&#8217;s the way to go. The biggest inequality in income since the Gilded Age. You know, Wall Street executives haven&#8217;t been taking a hit at all; their salaries, their bonuses, keep going higher and higher. They&#8217;re the ones that wrecked this economy, not the teachers, not labor, not workers, organized or unorganized. And while wages are going down, that hurts the economy for everyone. You need more purchasing power in the economy. You see, right now, gas prices going up again, more than four dollars a gallon here at the pump in California. That means less money for people to spend on all other kinds of things. So it has ripple effects throughout the entire economy. And it&#8217;s all part of this fantasy that if you could just get rid of government, somehow the private sector will create jobs. That&#8217;s never been the way that jobs and economic development has occurred in this country. So regulation is only a bad word when the regulators get captured by industry. Howie Stier: Draped in a neon-colored toga, L.A. performance artist Ari Kletzky was inspired to transform himself into a polychrome Statue of Liberty to make a stand for workers&#8217; rights. He was accompanied by costume designer Rachel Weir. Can you tell me about your outfit here today?</p> \n\n<p>Ari Kletzky: We are celebrating liberty and justice, which is the ability for everyone to have the freedom to influence our government without being controlled by other people&#8217;s privilege and wealth.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: OK, all these union members out here, they&#8217;re also protesting and exercising their rights; they&#8217;re just not dressed in every swath of fabric you could buy in Santee Alley. What explains this outfit&#8212;or do you dress like this every day?</p> \n\n<p>Rachel Weir: I wanted to participate in this protest as an artist, and so I&#8217;m a costume designer and I express myself through costume. And I wanted to explore the celebratory nature of justice, and to me that means bright colors, that means psychedelic, that means wearing a wig, that means going in drag. It means being fabulous.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: Are you pretty busy, are you working?</p> \n\n<p>Rachel Weir: Ah, a little bit. Wish I was working more, but I&#8217;m doing some footwork. I&#8217;m becoming a member of the Costumers Local 705. And I&#8217;m making contacts through there, and being a part of a community.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: You plan to join a union&#8212;are they going to get a job for you, or do you have to have a job before you join a union?</p> \n\n<p>Rachel Weir: I currently have a job that gave me the opportunity to join the union.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: Patrick Kelly is the secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local [952] from Orange County, California.</p> \n\n<p>Patrick Kelly: My name&#8217;s Patrick Kelly, I&#8217;m with Teamsters Local 952.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: How many people are in your union?</p> \n\n<p>Patrick Kelly: There&#8217;s about 9,000 active, and there&#8217;s about 1,300 or 1,400 that are out of work right now.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: How long have those 1,300 been out of work?</p> \n\n<p>Patrick Kelly: For the last year and a half, two years.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: And what&#8217;s your message here today?</p> \n\n<p>Patrick Kelly: Our message is that union people need to band together, register to vote, raise money for their packs, and start directly confronting the non-union employers, and pushing wages and benefits up.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: Governor Brown just announced billions of dollars in cuts. Is that affecting your union members?</p> \n\n<p>Patrick Kelly: Yeah, it&#8217;s affecting everybody. And my remedy on that is, let&#8217;s have a tax on the oil industry at the well head, and raise some serious money, because everybody&#8217;s getting killed on their gas and diesel prices. We need to recover that money from the oil companies and the energy companies at the point of production. Thoughts on what Obama could do to stimulate jobs for union members&#8212;stop supporting the hedge fund Democrats and the financial class, and start creating some jobs for working people and the unemployed.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: Phillip Mesa is an affable, 40-year-old grocery clerk who stocks the dairy department in an Albertson&#8217;s store in Ontario, California. He is also the rapper known as Mr. Picket Man.</p> \n\n<p>Phillip Mesa: My name is Phillip Mesa.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: You&#8217;re a union activist?</p> \n\n<p>Phillip Mesa: Yes, a union activist, union member. I&#8217;m on the executive board for my local UFCW Local 1428. I&#8217;m an Albertson&#8217;s employee that&#8217;s been with Albertson&#8217;s for 20 years.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: What does the store think about your rapping and Mr. Picket Man?</p> \n\n<p>Phillip Mesa: A lot of the stores, especially some of the recent management that I&#8217;ve had, they understand that it&#8217;s not that we want to set the company down, because we need the company to have our jobs. We just want the company to negotiate fairly with us as workers, and I feel most of the managers that I&#8217;ve worked for in the past two years understand that&#8212;the union would rather work with the company than work against the company. And I think they appreciate me; I&#8217;m honest with them and they&#8217;re honest with me.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: What&#8217;s your hourly wage at Albertsons?</p> \n\n<p>Phillip Mesa: Ah, $19.55, with Albertsons.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: That&#8217;s after 20 years.</p> \n\n<p>Phillip Mesa: Yeah, that&#8217;s at the top. The new ones are starting basically at minimum wage; I&#8217;m at the end, one of the last, the dying breed that probably has made this a career. A lot of the new hires, I mean a lot of the new ones won&#8217;t stick around to reach that point. The ones that are like me, myself, I mean, as we retire and get older and phase out of the industry, it&#8217;s going to be, basically, I feel that they&#8217;re just going to try to squeeze it down to a low-paying, low-wage job with high turnover rate, just to keep their costs down, just like a Wal-Mart does or something like that. And we just want to return it to the status that it once was, and that&#8217;s to be a good quality career, job.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: We take you out with Mr. Picket Man&#8217;s workers&#8217; rap, &#8220;Fight On.&#8221; [Rap music playing]</p> \n\n<p>* * *Peter Scheer:</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;m Peter Scheer with Josh Scheer, and we&#8217;re speaking with Truthdig sports writer, and L.A. Times sports writer, Mark Heisler. And we want to ask, as part of this national-themed show about labor&#8212;broaden the discussion and talk a little bit about sports labor. Because really, as you outline in your newest Truthdig piece, Mark, sports is an area where labor movements have been very successful.</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: It&#8217;s a weird, ah&#8230;really stretching the term labor, there. [Laughter] Because, you know, the labor is rich, by and large.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: Right.</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: So&#8230;and in baseball, the labor kind of runs the game; it&#8217;s really more powerful than the administration. So it&#8217;s kind of a, it&#8217;s definitely a specialized area of labor.</p> \n\n<p>Josh Scheer: I had a quick question, though, for the KPFK audience, because I&#8217;ve always actually wondered this, and I was trying to find this out. Do the major league baseball players&#8217; union, the NBA union&#8212;maybe you don&#8217;t know, maybe no one knows this&#8212;but do they actually support the public service unions and other unions, or is it kind of they&#8217;re out for themselves?</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: I don&#8217;t really know the answer to that, but my impression is&#8212;I&#8217;ve never read anything or heard anything about it&#8212;I think they&#8217;re pretty much, you know, like stand-alone entities. I don&#8217;t think they have very much to do with each other. Except there is some crossover&#8212;I think there&#8217;s a guy named Jeff Kessler, if I got the name right [Laughter]&#8212;I&#8217;m always getting, I get the Jeffs mixed up back there, and you know, some of them work for the league and some of them work for the NBA. But if I got the right one, you know, I think he may be doing some stuff for the NFL union right now&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Josh Scheer: Yeah. And he also does some stuff for the NBA too.</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: Yeah, his big thing is the NBA. And in management, too, Gary Bettman, who runs the NHL &#8230; was David Stern&#8217;s right-hand man. There was some crossover, you know, within sports. But there isn&#8217;t a whole lot outside of that, even if some very important people, like Marvin Miller, you know, came to baseball, came to the baseball union, I think he was like a steelworkers guy or somethin&#8217;.</p> \n\n<p>Josh Scheer: Yeah, Howard Ganz, also, he reps both the NBA and the NFL in terms of the management side [Laughs], as an attorney. But it&#8217;s interesting, though, because these unions are very successful and they&#8217;re very big, but we do&#8212;you know, the other unions that are in trouble&#8230;these, I mean, these unions expect us to go, like, &#8220;Oh, $9.3 billion, that&#8217;s a lot of money.&#8221; Right? So you&#8217;d think they&#8217;d want to support the lower-end unions, but&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: The union movement in general, you know, there&#8217;s&#8230;you talk about workers and solidarity, and supporting each other&#8230;You know, I think everybody kind of understands, as athletes and owners of sports teams, that&#8217;s a whole different thing; it&#8217;s just like its own little niche. And it&#8217;s an elite niche on both sides. And it doesn&#8217;t have very much to do with the outside world. So baseball owners&#8230;don&#8217;t have very much to do with U.S. Steel or anything like that.</p> \n\n<p>Josh Scheer: No.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: But there was a time when that wasn&#8217;t the case. And you had in the, I forget what year it was, but back when basketball, when the NBA was a struggling entity and the players showed some solidarity, the famous players and the less-famous players, refusing to play in the all-star game that year.</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: Oh yeah, I think [there&#8217;s] solidarity within the unions and within the sports&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: But there was a time when they weren&#8217;t, you know, pulling together for millions and millions of dollars for the richest among them. There was a time when it was just about having some basic standards, right, some basic safety? Mark Heisler: Oh yeah, absolutely. That was one of the hallmarks of the NBA, you know&#8230;the birth of the NBA union, was the big guys&#8212;the Tommy Heinsohns and the Bob Cousys and the Oscar Robertsons and the Elgin Baylors&#8212;they were standing up for the little guys, and that was the&#8230;tradition of the NBA union into the &#8217;90s. And Isiah Thomas, who was castigated for just about everything, people forget he was the last of the big stars who was the president of the union, who was running it for the little guys. And then the David Falk people got in, and David Falk started putting his star clients in important positions in the union, and trying to run it for the stars. And now I think they&#8217;re kind of back to where they were&#8212;the last couple of player heads have been Derek Fisher and Michael Curry&#8212;I think they&#8217;re back to where they were. On the other hand, no matter what they were doing, when the NBA players started the union they didn&#8217;t have very much awareness of the garment workers&#8217; union, or anything like that.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: Right.</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: It was basically&#8230;it was basketball players taking care of basketball players.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: What is the status of the labor movement, or the labor relations in sports now? There&#8217;s a lot of news with the NFL and the NBA maybe having lockout seasons, and how powerful are they still?</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: I think it varies dramatically from sport to sport. Very interestingly, there was a guy named Sal Galioto, I think is his name; he&#8217;s a New York investment guy&#8230;and he specializes in sports stuff, and he set up a company, and he was on CNBC and he was talking about the NFL and the NBA. And the point he made about the NFL was he thinks&#8230;business is so great that they&#8217;ll make a deal, that they&#8217;ll just have to make a deal, because that&#8217;s what logic dictates; there&#8217;s just no reason for them to lose games or lose the season because they are making a lot of money. Whereas he thinks the NBA is not doing that well, and the owners are very united, and it&#8217;s a whole different situation. And I think that&#8217;s true. On the other hand, I have a big question about whether the NBA is doing actually as badly as David Stern says it is, and you can find a wide divergence of opinion on that matter. On the other hand, Stern has been very, very successful in convincing just about everybody that the NBA owners are in extremely dire straits.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: I want to ask you about football, Mark, because you write in your latest <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">column</a> that if the NFL flew, like Icarus, too close to the sun, [NFL Commissioner Roger] Goodell would just have the orb moved. The NFL is wildly successful, and you say the players&#8217; union there has also been really successful. And at the same time you have this stuff coming out, with these head injuries, guys in their 40s getting Alzheimer&#8217;s, you know, the less famous people&#8212;they don&#8217;t have guaranteed contracts, they have&#8212;it&#8217;s not like the NBA, where they can make a few million and retire. You know, what&#8217;s wrong there, what&#8217;s&#8230;?</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: Well, there&#8217;s a very different dynamic in each sport about the relative strength of the union. The NFL union, although it has managed to exist and still is a force, is not very strong vis-&#224;-vis the owner. The owner&#8212;the NFL is a sport in which the owners have always dominated. And for&#8230;the evidence is just&#8230;the things you just mentioned, especially guaranteed contracts. And they have a hard cap, you know&#8230;they have the most owner-friendly system of the American professional sports leagues. The NBA&#8212;it&#8217;s a pretty even contest between management and the union. The management tends to think that it has the upper hand in it, and they&#8217;re all saying that they think that the union is going to fold. There&#8217;s only been one test, and the union held right up until January and the drop-dead date, and then both sides made concessions and made a deal. So that&#8217;s kind of an ongoing contest. In baseball, the union is extremely powerful. Having&#8230;they&#8217;ve had a lot of tests, I forget how many stoppages, four or five. And of course in [1994] they burned the World Series and really, essentially, taught the owners a lesson. And the owners have never really challenged them since. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s a completely player-friendly system now; there&#8217;s no salary cap whatsoever; there&#8217;s minor restrictions about, you know, luxury tax. But what baseball has done is&#8230;they&#8217;ve done a very good job of redistributing income, you know, with a revenue sharing plan, so that everybody&#8217;s making money. Now the one thing that the NBA owners have not done is&#8230;they claim&#8230;they&#8217;re talking about a $400 million operating loss, and I think it&#8217;s completely wrong. I think they&#8217;re tossing non-operating expenditures in there, like debt service. And I think the real number is the one that Forbes comes out with, and Forbes&#8217; figure for last season was&#8230;plus $150 million profit, except that most of it went to about five teams, and I think they had 12 teams making money and 18 teams losing by the end of it. I think the way it really breaks down is like five or six teams making almost all the real money, and about 10 of them lose a lot.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: Well, I guess the moral of the story is that even when the laborers are millionaires, you can&#8217;t trust management, right, Josh?</p> \n\n<p>Josh Scheer: Yeah. And thank you, Mark, and again, we&#8217;ll continue this discussion because I&#8217;m sure this won&#8217;t go anywhere.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: All right. That&#8217;s Mark Heisler joining us to talk about sports. Thanks, Mark.</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: My pleasure.</p> \n\n<p>* * *Peter Scheer:</p> \n\n<p>This is Peter Scheer with Kasia Anderson, and we&#8217;re joined by Bill Boyarsky and Jim Mamer as part of this special, national broadcast on the theme of labor. Their two pieces are &#8220;Flunking Teachers Gives the Ruling Class a Pass,&#8221; by Bill Boyarsky, and &#8220;Time for a Little Education,&#8221; by Jim Mamer.</p> \n\n<p>Kasia Anderson: And Jim&#8212;this is Kasia&#8212;I wanted to ask you, just by way of kicking off here &#8230; we can&#8217;t say your exact quotation on the radio here, but I&#8217;ll paraphrase. You say, &#8220;I&#8217;m a retired teacher, and I&#8217;m ticked off.&#8221; That&#8217;s what opens your piece. Do you want to give us an idea of what got you going there?</p> \n\n<p>Jim Mamer: You mean &#8230; I&#8217;m not ticked off all the time.</p> \n\n<p>Kasia Anderson: No, right, right. Yeah, very good-natured individual, but in this case, you make an exception.</p> \n\n<p>Jim Mamer: You know, it&#8217;s been pretty obvious over a while, but the economic problems and the debt crisis in general, and complex problems in education have seemed to be reduced to an attack on government workers, and teachers in particular. So it is kind of offensive to be offered bumper-sticker solutions to everything. And I guess in this case it&#8217;s &#8220;fire bad teachers.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: Bill, on this note, you start your column by saying &#8220;With all the evil people in the world, why are public school teachers being villainized, and how did they attract such powerful enemies?&#8221; And you&#8217;ve gone out in the field to look into this question. What did you find?</p> \n\n<p>Bill Boyarsky: I found that there&#8217;s people who are in favor of so-called education reform that tend to be business people, such as&#8212;forward-looking business people such as Bill Gates at Microsoft, Arne Duncan, the secretary of education in the Obama administration. And then a lot of investors, hedge-fund investors and other investors in charter schools, which are basically government-financed, privately operated schools, that are, in a sense, privatizing the &#8230; public schools. So there&#8217;s an economic motive, and then there&#8217;s a strong ideological motive, this sort of business &#8220;if I could just get in there with this enterprise, and clean it up, and fire all the incompetents, and cut down the workforce, everything would be fine.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Kasia Anderson: Yeah, you&#8217;ve made the comparison to basically like corporate raiders, right? Where they just come in and sweep through the place and fire everyone right and left, and try to restructure.</p> \n\n<p>Bill Boyarsky: Right. Right, Kasia, with the know-it-all CEO coming in, you know, with all of the answers, to what is an extremely complex situation.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: Jim, you&#8217;re not just a teacher&#8212;or I should say a retired teacher&#8212;but you were a great teacher. You won a national award for your teaching. And I want to know why, as other groups like the police and firemen are able to say &#8220;Hey, if you don&#8217;t treat us right you&#8217;re going to, what, have crime and danger and &#8230;&#8221; you know, why is it with teachers we&#8217;re able to say, &#8220;Your kids are going to end up dumb if you don&#8217;t hire good teachers.&#8221; We want to be competitive in the world, so we&#8217;re going to take it out on teachers; we&#8217;re going to have fewer teachers who are going to be less well paid. I mean, isn&#8217;t this a recipe for disaster?</p> \n\n<p>Jim Mamer: Oh, it&#8217;s definitely a recipe for disaster. I&#8217;m not sure that the police and the firefighters are actually as immune to those attacks as that sounds. But in terms of teachers, I think there&#8217;s two contradictory messages that are being sent out at the same time. And one of them, obviously, we talked about, is that teacher unions are the major obstacle to effective reform; I&#8217;ve never thought teachers&#8217; unions should be primarily about reform anyway. I mean, teacher unions are there to protect teachers. But they&#8217;re being cast as the main reason we don&#8217;t have reform, and you end up at the same time with this&#8212;especially from the Obama administration, and I suspect almost every officeholder&#8212;saying we need more teachers; we&#8217;ve got the baby boom retiring, and we need good teachers, and this is a great job. There was an article this morning in the L.A. Times talking about the same thing. The fact that the number of people who are entering the teaching profession has fallen&#8212;I think this is just about the state of California&#8212;by 29 percent in the last couple of years. So you&#8212;we&#8217;ve really got a problem coming up. You can&#8217;t attack teachers, attack their pensions, attack virtually everything they&#8217;re doing in the classroom, and also call for more people to want to be teachers. And yeah, I think we&#8217;re headed to &#8230; in a real bad direction.</p> \n\n<p>Kasia Anderson: Bill, I wanted to ask you, from your column&#8212;one of the things I love the most about your writing is that you actually go out on the street and into institutions in various parts of society and you talk to people. It&#8217;s, you know, Basic Reporting 101, but seems like it&#8217;s lacking these days. You went to a couple of different places and talked to people about your most recent piece. What did you find, kind of out there in the world?</p> \n\n<p>Bill Boyarsky: Well, I went to a new high school in Los Angeles, the Robert Kennedy educational complex; it&#8217;s built on the site of the old Ambassador Hotel, where Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968. And there are six small high schools on this site, and they, some of them, specialize in music or theater or just basic high school. The one I visited was run by the UCLA School of Education and the Los Angeles School District, and it was &#8230; a general high school. And it&#8217;s also, these high schools&#8212;they&#8217;re called pilot schools&#8212;they&#8217;re also deeply involved in the teachers&#8217; union. The teachers&#8217; union helps shape the high school, as do the faculty and the administrators on the site. I found that they conduct themselves in a way that&#8217;s really contrary to what the so-called reformers believe in, which is&#8212;you know, they believe in testing, testing of students; comparison of the test scores of one teacher with another, and all of that. And they [the RFK schools] have rather a long and complex system of evaluation of teachers by the principal, by peers, and by outside groups. And they actually look at the work product of the students and the quality of the assignments, and they compare the assignments to the work product. They realize&#8212;and I agree&#8212;that, you know, teachers should be evaluated, and done in a systematic way. And that if a teacher isn&#8217;t cutting it, the teacher should go. The teachers at this school, under their union contract, they sign one-year contracts. And if they&#8217;re not making it at the end of the year, then they&#8217;re not picked up the following year. They have to go somewhere else. And so there is a system of evaluation, and there are standards. But it&#8217;s one that reflects the realities of the classroom, and that&#8217;s what impressed me. I was also impressed by just walking around the campus and looking at how such a large school, which could be like a lot of big-city schools&#8212;you know, this inhuman fortress&#8212;was really made into an open and pleasant place. Jim Mamer: I think you&#8217;ve probably all seen the &#8220;Waiting for Superman&#8221; documentary?</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: Right.</p> \n\n<p>Jim Mamer: That begins&#8212;somewhere near the beginning is this guy, Geoffrey Canada, who looks at the camera and simply says, &#8220;Public school &#8230; this thing is just an utter failure.&#8221; Well, it&#8217;s not just an utter failure; there are really good schools out there. And the ones that are being lauded, the charter schools in that film&#8212;it&#8217;s interesting; I have no objection to charter schools. But if you look at the research, they have just as many successful schools&#8212;I think if I remember the research right from a couple of years ago, 17 percent of charter schools are doing better than their neighboring public schools; 37 percent are doing worse. And the rest are about the same. Well, that&#8217;s not a nut film. So you have this guy saying it&#8217;s an utter failure, and I think people want to believe it. There&#8217;s even one point in that film where Eric Hanushek, who&#8217;s an economist with the Hoover Institute, looks at this chart and says if you fire 5 to 10 percent of the bad teachers and replace them with average, not outstanding, teachers but average teachers, the American educational system will be equal to Finland. And Finland keeps coming up No. 1 or No. 2 on all of the international tests. It&#8217;s just crazy. Somehow we&#8217;ve focused only on the performance of teachers, and we&#8217;ve got this stereotype that the entire public school system&#8217;s failing. It&#8217;s not.</p> \n\n<p>Kasia Anderson: Bill, maybe for one last question, can you give us your take on what the main sort of opposition to teachers, the party lines are, and maybe how to refute them?</p> \n\n<p>Bill Boyarsky: The main attack on teachers comes from the use of tests, especially one called the value-added test, which is&#8212;the value-added examinations, which are&#8212;which the Los Angeles Times has done a series of stories comparing the value-added scores of teachers in elementary schools in the Los Angeles School District and, you know, publishing the names and the scores of these teachers. These, basically, without getting too complicated&#8212;you take the test scores of the kid at the end of one semester, and from that you kind of project what the kid should do into the next semester, and if the kid does better, that&#8217;s what they call &#8220;added value,&#8221; and that&#8217;s good for the teacher; and if the kid does worse, then that&#8217;s bad for the teacher, and the teacher has a lower score. I&#8217;m vastly oversimplifying. But there seems to be a feeling&#8212;and I mean, it&#8217;s kind of like business, you know; it&#8217;s like &#8230; you can quantify everything. Everything can be quantified, and from your quantifying it, you can get dead-sure results that one teacher is better than another. Well, as a matter of fact, there&#8217;s a good amount of margin of error in this value-added system. And so the difference between the teacher who has a high value-added score and one that has an average one is pretty hard to measure. That&#8217;s one really big objection to what they&#8217;re doing with teachers. Why&#8212;I just don&#8217;t know why, though&#8212;the media, and these business leaders like Gates and like Arne Duncan, are focusing on teachers, because they&#8217;re kind of inflaming this. And, you know, a lot of things about teachers are&#8212;people like their kid&#8217;s teacher, the one they have them in contact with, usually. But then, they may not like the system.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: Well, that&#8217;s, regretfully, all the time we have, but I want to thank you both for joining us.</p> \n\n<p>Jim Mamer: Thank you. I enjoyed it.</p> \n\n<p>Bill Boyarsky: Me, too.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: They are Bill Boyarsky, Truthdig reporter at large, and Jim Mamer, a veteran teacher&#8212;and a good one, by the way&#8212;now retired. Thanks for being with us, guys.</p> \n\n<p>Kasia Anderson: Thank you.</p> \n\n<p>Bill Boyarsky: Bye-bye.</p> \n\n<p>* * *Peter Scheer:</p> \n\n<p>Welcome back. We are speaking with Dolores Huerta, the co-founder of the United Farm Workers union, and Paul Schrade, a former officer of the United Auto Workers union [UAW], who just won an award from the Cesar Chavez Foundation.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: You know, let me&#8212;this is Robert Scheer&#8212;let me set this up. I recall when Paul was&#8212;I think you were the West Coast regional director of the United Auto Workers &#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: I was on the national board.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: &#8230; yeah, on the national board. And you did two things that I thought were really quite remarkable. You were the first major labor leader to come out against the Vietnam War, even though some of your workers that you represented were working in the defense industry. And the other thing you did that was so gutsy is you supported the farmworkers. And maybe, Dolores, do you have memory of that time? Could you say something about that?</p> \n\n<p>Dolores Huerta: Oh, absolutely. Not only did Paul support the farmworkers, but there were busloads of autoworkers that would come from Los Angeles to come to the picket lines, and then Paul actually brought <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/aboutus/history/history/reuther.cfm\" type=\"external\">Walter Reuther</a> himself to the Forty Acres, you know, to Delano, to be there with us. And of course it was also through Paul Schrade that we formed our connection with Robert Kennedy, Sen. Robert Kennedy. So Paul was a&#8212;I might have called him the padrino in Spanish, and it&#8217;s got a better connotation in Spanish than in English, but the godfather [Laughs] of the farmworkers&#8217; union, because Paul&#8212;not only was he helping us back then, but he&#8217;s been helping throughout all of these years to support the farmworkers. And also just for my foundation, for community organizing, Paul is on my board; I&#8217;m really proud to say that. But his influence was very, very huge. And as you know, at that time the autoworkers were not part of the AFL-CIO. And so we were, you know, we didn&#8217;t really have that support of labor, and at that point in time I think it was only the UAW, I believe the <a href=\"http://www.ilwu.org/%20\" type=\"external\">ILWU</a>, and I believe it was also the Newspaper Guild that was supportive of our fledgling union then, of the National Farm Workers&#8217; Association.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: You mentioned bringing Bobby Kennedy, but it was Paul Schrade who was standing next to Bobby Kennedy when he was assassinated. And, Paul, you were very severely injured. And while that, obviously, was a traumatic moment, those days represent sort of a high point for trade unionism in America. And it&#8217;s been downhill since, and now we have a challenge to the very idea of collective bargaining, and so forth. Can you describe the arc as you&#8217;ve seen it?</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: Well, a lot of high points &#8230; the recognition [by] General Motors of the sit-down strikes in the late &#8217;30s is important. And I also think that we&#8217;re on our way now to a new birth &#8230; of the labor movement with the terrible action by Republican governors and the Congress against workers. And I see the labor movement beginning to rise again.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: And what about this victory&#8212;I&#8217;ve seen some signs of it&#8212;a victory in California that will go against this grain of reactionary governors, that maybe our Legislature and our governor will sign off something on legislation that will help the farmworkers &#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: No&#8212;Dolores probably knows more about this than I do, but the L.A. Times reported that the California state Senate passed a law providing for a card check rather than a vote of workers, in order to get bargaining rights. And it&#8217;s been passed by the Senate, and probably will be passed by the Assembly; of course would be signed by Jerry Brown. And Jerry Brown is &#8230; not like those people, the governors in Wisconsin, Ohio and the other states, where they&#8217;re attacking laborers&#8217; rights.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Do you have a comment on that, Dolores?</p> \n\n<p>Dolores Huerta: I hope the governor signs it. I&#8217;m just getting a little concerned about, you know, what he&#8217;s facing up against with his budget deficit, and he&#8217;s gotten the Chamber of Commerce to endorse the extension of these taxes that he&#8217;s trying to extend. I don&#8217;t know how that would affect what the governor does in terms of the card check for the farmworkers. I would hope that if it passes the Assembly&#8212;we know it&#8217;s passed the Senate&#8212;that he would be able to sign it this year. If he doesn&#8217;t sign it this year, I know that Jerry Brown, we can count on him to &#8230; sign it the next year. And I&#8217;m just&#8212;this is my opinion; I haven&#8217;t spoken to the governor [Laughs], so I don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s doing on this issue. I know it&#8217;s a very big issue, not only for the farmworkers, but you know, it&#8217;s an issue for all of labor. I think all of the labor unions should have the ability to have workers choose their labor representative by their signature. And I always like to say, if your signature&#8217;s good enough to buy a home, open a bank account, get your passport, you know, buy an automobile, get your driver&#8217;s license, get a marriage or a divorce, it ought to be good enough to choose your union, right? And they should make it as easy as possible. And I think this whole attack on labor is very scary, because labor is of course what creates the middle class of our country. And if you get rid of labor unions, you get rid of the middle class; if you get rid of the middle class, you get rid of democracy. So then you have a plutocracy, and this is really, really scary, what&#8217;s happening right now, and I think a lot of people don&#8217;t realize this. And not only the attack on collective bargaining, you know, the attacks on teachers, the public employees; and then going after their retirement, after their pensions. You know, people don&#8217;t realize that when you negotiate&#8212;I know Paul&#8217;s been at the bargaining table, I&#8217;ve been at the bargaining table for farmworkers&#8212;when you negotiate a pension for workers, you&#8217;re giving up part of wages. So workers have given up part of their wages to be able to have some kind of retirement in the future, and now you hear all this talk about going after the pensions of the public employees, and other workers. So it&#8217;s a very vicious attack that&#8217;s going on right now. Instead of attacking the people that created this mess&#8212;which are the financial managers and the people who really don&#8217;t do any physical work, right, but just manage other people&#8217;s money, and have gotten our country into such a big mess&#8212;they&#8217;re going after the working people who create the wealth of the country. So it&#8217;s a very, very scary situation.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Yeah, and it&#8217;s a historic scapegoating situation. Here we had this banking meltdown that has impoverished the nation, and then they want to blame immigrants; they want to blame union people; it&#8217;s absolutely bizarre. And professor [Joseph] Stiglitz, winner of the Nobel Prize, Columbia professor, has an article in Vanity Fair this month saying, you know, pointing out that 1 percent of the people in this country control 40 percent of the wealth. And you use the word plutocracy&#8212;I mean, it&#8217;s incredible! And yet we have this tea party movement, we have outrage, what, about teachers getting a pension. It&#8217;s bizarre. And what happened to the relationship&#8212;was it the government attacks on labor, was it corporate attacks on labor&#8212;what has happened to the situation of the labor unions in this country?</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: It&#8217;s all that big money going into the war against labor, and to control the government. Eisenhower talked about the military-industrial complex, but what he left out, a point that he was going to make, and that is that the big money buys the Congress. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened. It&#8217;s controlled not just by the Koch brothers, but all the other corporations that buy into the presidency and also into the Congress.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Well, take us back to that moment when Bobby Kennedy was both against the war in Vietnam, against the military-industrial complex, and came out in support of the farmworkers. Can the two of you describe that? When I mention that it&#8217;s a high point in our country, I don&#8217;t mean that it was the only great victory, but it was a moment in which there was a lot of idealism felt about, at least, the farmworkers, and the possibility for progress, and &#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: Well, let&#8217;s start with the victory first. Dolores was with us that night, and was in the pantry when we lost Robert Kennedy. But the important part of that day was that the farmworkers, under &#8230; with the leadership of Dolores and Cesar [Chavez], were campaigning in all of the districts in Los Angeles. And when [Kennedy aide] Frank Mankiewicz got word that the polls had closed in East L.A. and in Watts, in the black community, he sent out scouts that said why are these polls closing, and the guys came back laughing, because by 3 and 4 o&#8217;clock, a hundred percent of the people had voted in many of those precincts. Because Cesar and Dolores were out there, getting voters out, and that&#8217;s the reason Robert Kennedy won that primary. And Dolores was with us that night, celebrating that victory, and also facing that tragedy, for us and for the country, when Bob was killed. Robert Scheer: How do you&#8212;you know, Dolores, I want to ask you&#8212;how do you guys keep going, you know? I mean, you&#8217;ve been at this a long time, you and Paul. And how do you keep up your spirit, your idealism, you&#8217;re still out there organizing, you&#8217;re still optimistic &#8230; what do you drink? What&#8217;s the secret, here?</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: [Laughs] No, it&#8217;s the passion for justice, for one thing, and the fact that we have been effective in many ways; we&#8217;ve lost a lot of battles, but we&#8217;re effective. Dolores worked with us on getting the Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools built, after we were opposed by Donald Trump and by the school board and by the [Los Angeles] Conservancy. We won that school; it was a 23-year fight, but we did it. And that keeps me going after, you know, you walk into that school now and see the kids, thirty-five hundred kids are going to a very marvelously constructed school.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: This is the same location where you were shot, and where Bobby Kennedy was killed.</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: Yeah.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Right, yeah.</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: In fact, during the dedication, on November 13th&#8212;Dolores was with us then&#8212;we were standing, when we were speaking, right where Robert Kennedy made his victory speech. But that location, which was the Embassy Ballroom, is now the library. And it&#8217;s such a beautiful structure now, all the false ceilings and draperies out of there, it&#8217;s just a beautiful room, an exact replica of the Embassy Ballroom where Bob made his victory speech. And Bill Rosendahl, who was with us that night too, just was in tears, because it was such a happy moment to have that library and that school dedicated for the people.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Bill Rosendahl [is now] on the City Council. You know, I was there that night, and I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve ever been in a more depressing scene; I had just interviewed Bobby Kennedy upstairs; John Lewis, the great congressman from Georgia, was crying on the floor, a civil rights veteran. So, Dolores, how do you pick yourself up each time, and keep going? I mean, you&#8217;ve spoken in my classes; I know you have this enormous enthusiasm. What keeps you going? We need some optimism now.</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: She&#8217;s great.</p> \n\n<p>Dolores Huerta: Well, it&#8217;s like Paul said&#8212;we&#8217;ve been through &#8230; social justice, right, and that gives us the energy. And Cesar always used to say that &#8230; the struggle itself gives you the energy to continue, and not to give up. And that&#8217;s the other thing I love to quote about Cesar, since we&#8217;re celebrating his birthday, is he always said that you&#8217;re always going to win as long as you don&#8217;t quit. No matter how long it takes &#8230; ultimately you will win, as long as you don&#8217;t quit; that&#8217;s the important thing. And the other thing I love to quote Cesar on, when he talked about nonviolence, you know&#8212;nonviolence also means having the patience to hang in there. To know it&#8217;s not going to happen quickly, that it&#8217;s going to take a lot of work to achieve the justice that we&#8217;re seeking, that we&#8217;re working for. And you know the other thing&#8212;I just want to comment on something that you mentioned a little while ago, about how California, we were so different than the rest of the country&#8212;and I want to give credit again to the labor movement, especially to Maria Elena Durazo, who is the head of the labor council there in Los Angeles. But you know, I had the good fortune, at her invitation, to join some of those people that were walking the precincts in this last election, and who were they? They were immigrants; they were the people from the hotels; they were the people from the&#8212;the janitors, you know? You know, the homemakers &#8230; the hotel keepers, and you know, this is like immigrant people, you know, that have just become citizens, and many of them were not yet citizens, that were knocking on those doors in Los Angeles in this last election, and they knocked on over 300,000 doors. And we saw somewhat of a miracle, I call it, because we ended up with the most progressive slate in the country, you know. From Jerry Brown, Kamala Harris&#8212;the first African-American, also [Asian] Indian, woman to be elected to [the attorney general&#8217;s] office, you know, in the state. And all of the constitutional offices were from Northern California, and they were elected with the Latino votes from Southern California. And I think that&#8217;s just incredible, and I think that sets a model for the rest of the country. That they&#8217;ve got to realize that the only way we&#8217;re going to win, and we&#8217;re going to counteract the tea baggers and these anti-union, anti-immigrant, anti-women&#8212;because, you know, they&#8217;re also going after choice and after the LGBT community&#8212;the only way that we can counteract that is with organizing on the ground. And this is what laborers do, this is what labor unions do. And this is why they want to get rid of labor unions. And I think the governor of Wisconsin said, well, if we get rid of the labor unions then we get rid of the Democrats. And if we get rid of the Democrats and we get rid of labor unions, then the Republicans have complete control, and they&#8217;ve already shown us what they&#8217;re trying to do; you know, by getting rid of education and privatizing education, privatizing everything. So &#8230; and I know people don&#8217;t like to use that word, fascism, but this is where we&#8217;re at; this is the road that these people want to put us on. And I think it&#8217;s up to us to fight back. We have to remind people that Hitler was elected to office, you know? It wasn&#8217;t a coup; he was elected. And that we see some of the same patterns there; the xenophobia, the fighting people of color, wanting to put everybody in prison. It&#8217;s really scary.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Yeah, you know, it&#8217;s an important point, I think maybe the most important point, to be made. Because we&#8217;ve really seen a classic bait-and-switch, you know; we&#8217;ve seen the hijacking of what should be a real populism and are given a phony populism. So instead of focusing attention on Wall Street&#8212;on the big corporate, on the big banks and the damage they did to everybody in this country, beginning with working people&#8212;instead, we have the blame, as I said before, on the immigrants and now on the teachers, and on people working in the public sector, on unionized workers. But what&#8217;s so positive about what you&#8217;ve just said&#8212;and I think we need to hear this from time to time&#8212;is that California did not go the way of the rest of the country. California&#8212;which, you know, is not Greenwich Village; it&#8217;s not some isolated, bohemian center&#8212;California gave us Richard Nixon, it gave us Ronald Reagan&#8212;you know, it&#8217;s a real state, and the most important state, I would argue. And yet in this last election&#8212;and the media didn&#8217;t notice it, really, very much&#8212;California went the other way. And I think your point, Dolores, is really the one to take away from this: It is the role of the immigrant labor force that the unions have so effectively organized in California. And that has changed the whole balance.</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: And just like it was the workforce back in the &#8217;30s, when the UAW first got organized; a lot of those people were from the South and the Midwest, and they really carried the ball, and through sit-down strikes, changed the life of workers in the automobile industry.</p> \n\n<p>Dolores Huerta: Right, and they&#8217;re celebrating 100 years of the <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2011/3/25/100th_anniversary_of_the_triangle_shirtwaist%20\" type=\"external\">Triangle Shirtwaist fire</a> in New York, you know, when the garment workers&#8212;you know, out of that tragedy came the garment workers&#8217; union &#8230; that was organized. And then that, of course, led the way to many of the other labor unions, also, that happened on the East Coast after that tragic fire, which killed all these young women that were locked into a building, and they couldn&#8217;t get out. All these shirt-makers, these young women who sat at their sewing machines. So, and that was an immigrant labor force at that time also, that worked in those garment factories. So we know that the working people are really the ones that are the engine of the economy, the engine of progress, and if anything, if our country has gone down the tube economically, it&#8217;s because we have disdained our working people, we&#8217;ve taken their jobs away and sent them overseas, and we&#8217;re just making them into a nation of bankers. And this is very wrong. But we&#8217;ve got to kind of remind people&#8212;and this is what we do with our organizing&#8212;is that we have it within our power to change these things. I just came from New Mexico, and you know, we have now a Latina governor, Susana Martinez, very conservative. But good news for everybody&#8212;even though she had her agenda, very anti-immigrant agenda, taking away driver&#8217;s licenses from people who were undocumented&#8212;the state Senate of New Mexico stopped her in her tracks, and she couldn&#8217;t get her agenda through the Legislature. So there&#8217;s some glimmers of hope out there.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: You know, I want to end this on a note of hope about older people; you know, it happens that as we&#8217;re recording this, I&#8217;m experiencing my 75th birthday. And I&#8217;ve known you guys for a long time; I remember going back to those early rallies, and so forth, when I was editing Ramparts magazine. And 75 years ago my father lost his job&#8212;the day I was born, had to tell my mother that&#8212;didn&#8217;t get it back for four years; they were both garment workers. And when you mentioned the Triangle disaster&#8212;my parents talked about it all the time, and unions were the basis of our life. And ironically, if you read Ronald Reagan&#8217;s own autobiography, he&#8217;ll tell you Roosevelt was, you know, a god in their family&#8217;s house; his father went to work for the New Deal. And without the New Deal, Ronald Reagan, of all people, said his family would have starved. And I think some of us old-timers have to remind people that it was, as you said before, unions that gave this country the gift of the middle class that is the basis of democracy. So do you guys have a last, positive word? I know you always do. Paul?</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: Well, it&#8217;s good to be with the Scheer family, and happy birthday!</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: [Laughs] OK! And Dolores?</p> \n\n<p>Dolores Huerta: Well &#8230; thank you for your great light of journalism; you were a light back there in the &#8217;60s, when everything seemed so dark, and to know that your light is still shining&#8212;and also that you have, I guess, your son following in your footsteps&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Yeah &#8230; all three of them, all three of them.</p> \n\n<p>Dolores Huerta: &#8230; so that more people can hear the way that you really interpret what&#8217;s happening in our world for the rest of us. And happy birthday, also!</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: OK. Great, guys, thanks.</p> \n\n<p>Dolores Huerta: Si se puede!</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: That&#8217;s it for this special edition of Truthdig Radio from KPFK Los Angeles.

One of the biggest players is Casey's General Stores , which focuses on building clusters of stores in small-town America. The company is based in Iowa and got its start in the Midwest, but it is moving to both the South and East rapidly.</p> \n\n<p>While some might think of this as a relatively boring industry, Casey's focus on becoming one of the biggest pizza companies in the country has gotten investors excited lately. Shares have tripled over the past five years, and the bump in the company's \"food and fountain\" comparable-store sales (comps) is one of the biggest reasons.</p> \n\n<p>The thesis for investors is simple: People go to Casey's to get their (low-margin) gas, but as they go inside, they buy more groceries, cigarettes, and most importantly (high-margin) prepared foods -- with pizza being the primary food that's bought. While gas might make up the bulk of revenue, it's things that are bought inside the store that contribute the most gross profit dollars.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/pie-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;amp;utm_campaign=pie_chart\" type=\"external\">Create pie charts Opens a New Window.</a></p> \n\n<p>The company has done a fantastic job of capitalizing on this opportunity, and should be lauded for seeing a niche that was underserved. Investors, however, need to be careful about management overpromising and underdelivering. That's what happened this year, and it seems like the table is set for it to happen again. Casey's reported Q4 2016 results Monday and held a conference call with analysts Tuesday morning.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Data source: SEC filings and Casey's General Stores investor relations.</p> \n\n<p>When it comes to convenience stores, investors shouldn't pay too much attention to revenue numbers. That's because the price of gas can fluctuate widely, and management has little control over this. Like you saw above, it also is a very low-margin aspect of the business.</p> \n\n<p>One year ago, management set out goals for the company's comps and margins in its three main categories. As you can see below, they met almost all of those, with one very notable exception.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/column-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;amp;utm_campaign=column_chart\" type=\"external\">Create column charts Opens a New Window.</a></p> \n\n<p>It is the shortfall in food and fountain that I find the most concerning. This is the central thesis to an investment in Casey's.</p> \n\n<p>No doubt, any company would die for comps above 5% in any category. But the assumption of double-digit comp growth in prepared foods is already baked into Casey's stock price -- and if the company continues to fall short of these projections, investors will pay the price.</p> \n\n<p>Management continually stated during the conference call that the reason for the shortfall was simply because the rollout of many growth initiatives -- a mobile food ordering app, 24-hour service, pizza delivery, and major remodels -- were weighted heavily toward the fourth quarter.</p> \n\n<p>But even then, comps during the fourth quarter were 8.2% -- well short of the 10.4% management foresaw for the year. That should give investors pause.</p> \n\n<p>It's also worth noting that the company either built or acquired 56 new stores during the fiscal year, but this fell well short of the 75-113 new locations that management said it would accomplish during the past 12 months.</p> \n\n<p>When management released its outlook for fiscal 2017, it said that it expected food and fountain to grow by 10.2% -- basically the same outlook it gave last year. Given the company's failure to live up to expectations in 2016, analysts were surprised.</p> \n\n<p>When pressed by analysts as to why the company would give such a high estimate, CEO Terry Handly said that the company was confident that the aforementioned growth initiatives could help get comps \"back in the double-digit area\" and that they are \"cautiously optimistic.\"</p> \n\n<p>Cautiously optimistic? That struck me as an odd way to put it. After falling 20% short of its comp growth and then restating the same goals for the current year, I would classify that goal as overly optimistic.</p> \n\n<p>It's also worth mentioning that a number of analysts questioned whether Hy-Vee's new convenience stores -- which are usually placed in front of their namesake grocery stores and offer prepared food as well -- were becoming a serious competitor. Management said they were a competitor, but left it at that.</p> \n\n<p>Given the nearly 5% sell-off in the stock as of 1:45 p.m. Tuesday, the market has concerns as well. Management made clear that the pace of store openings will accelerate in the coming year. That's a good move, as the company wants to establish itself in new markets it thinks it can exploit.</p> \n\n<p>Currently, the company trades for 21 times trailing earnings and 20 times 2017's expected earnings. That's not overly expensive or cheap, but I believe the performance of the company's food and fountain comps will be the primary determinant of where the stock heads over the next 12 months.</p> \n\n<p>The article <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/06/07/where-caseys-general-stores-inc-fell-short.aspx\" type=\"external\">Where Casey's General Stores Inc.

With each anniversary, the steps crumble beneath our feet, the stones ever more cracked, the sand ever finer. Five years of catastrophe in Iraq and I think of Churchill, who in the end called Palestine a &#8220;hell-disaster&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>But we have used these parallels before and they have drifted away in the Tigris breeze. Iraq is swamped in blood. Yet what is the state of our remorse? Why, we will have a public inquiry &#8212; but not yet! If only inadequacy was our only sin.</p> \n\n<p>Today, we are engaged in a fruitless debate. What went wrong? How did the people &#8212; the senatus populusque Romanus of our modern world &#8212; not rise up in rebellion when told the lies about weapons of mass destruction, about Saddam&#8217;s links with Osama bin Laden and 11 September? How did we let it happen? And how come we didn&#8217;t plan for the aftermath of war?</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Oh, the British tried to get the Americans to listen, Downing Street now tells us. We really, honestly did try, before we absolutely and completely knew it was right to embark on this illegal war. There is now a vast literature on the Iraq debacle and there are precedents for post-war planning &#8212; of which more later &#8212; but this is not the point. Our predicament in Iraq is on an infinitely more terrible scale.</p> \n\n<p>As the Americans came storming up Iraq in 2003, their cruise missiles hissing through the sandstorm towards a hundred Iraqi towns and cities, I would sit in my filthy room in the Baghdad Palestine Hotel, unable to sleep for the thunder of explosions, and root through the books I&#8217;d brought to fill the dark, dangerous hours. Tolstoy&#8217;s War and Peace reminded me how conflict can be described with sensitivity and grace and horror &#8212; I recommend the Battle of Borodino &#8212; along with a file of newspaper clippings. In this little folder, there was a long rant by Pat Buchanan, written five months earlier; and still, today I feel its power and its prescience and its absolute historical honesty: &#8220;With our MacArthur Regency in Baghdad, Pax Americana will reach apogee. But then the tide recedes, for the one endeavour at which Islamic people excel is expelling imperial powers by terror or guerrilla war.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;They drove the Brits out of Palestine and Aden, the French out of Algeria, the Russians out of Afghanistan, the Americans out of Somalia and Beirut, the Israelis out of Lebanon. We have started up the road to empire and over the next hill we will meet those who went before. The only lesson we learn from history is that we do not learn from history.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>How easily the little men took us into the inferno, with no knowledge or, at least, interest in history. None of them read of the 1920 Iraqi insurgency against British occupation, nor of Churchill&#8217;s brusque and brutal settlement of Iraq the following year.</p> \n\n<p>On our historical radars, not even Crassus appeared, the wealthiest Roman general of all, who demanded an emperorship after conquering Macedonia &#8212; &#8220;Mission Accomplished&#8221; &#8212; and vengefully set forth to destroy Mesopotamia. At a spot in the desert near the Euphrates river, the Parthians &#8212; ancestors of present day Iraqi insurgents &#8212; annihilated the legions, chopped off Crassus&#8217;s head and sent it back to Rome filled with gold. Today, they would have videotaped his beheading.</p> \n\n<p>To their monumental hubris, these little men who took us to war five years ago now prove that they have learnt nothing. Anthony Blair &#8212; as we should always have called this small town lawyer &#8212; should be facing trial for his mendacity. Instead, he now presumes to bring peace to an Arab-Israeli conflict which he has done so much to exacerbate. And now we have the man who changed his mind on the legality of war &#8212; and did so on a single sheet of A4 paper &#8212; daring to suggest that we should test immigrants for British citizenship. Question 1, I contend, should be: Which blood-soaked British attorney general helped to send 176 British soldiers to their deaths for a lie? Question 2: How did he get away with it?</p> \n\n<p>But in a sense, the facile, dumbo nature of Lord Goldsmith&#8217;s proposal is a clue to the whole transitory, cardboard structure of our decision-making. The great issues that face us &#8212; be they Iraq or Afghanistan, the US economy or global warming, planned invasions or &#8220;terrorism&#8221; &#8212; are discussed not according to serious political timetables but around television schedules and press conferences.</p> \n\n<p>Will the first air raids on Iraq hit prime-time television in the States? Mercifully, yes. Will the first US troops in Baghdad appear on the breakfast shows? Of course. Will Saddam&#8217;s capture be announced by Bush and Blair simultaneously?</p> \n\n<p>But this is all part of the problem. True, Churchill and Roosevelt argued about the timing of the announcement that war in Europe had ended. And it was the Russians who pipped them to the post. But we told the truth. When the British were retreating to Dunkirk, Churchill announced that the Germans had &#8220;penetrated deeply and spread alarm and confusion in their tracks&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>Why didn&#8217;t Bush or Blair tell us this when the Iraqi insurgents began to assault the Western occupation forces? Well, they were too busy telling us that things were getting better, that the rebels were mere &#8220;dead-enders&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>On 17 June 1940, Churchill told the people of Britain: &#8220;The news from France is very bad and I grieve for the gallant French people who have fallen into this terrible misfortune.&#8221; Why didn&#8217;t Blair or Bush tell us that the news from Iraq was very bad and that they grieved &#8212; even just a few tears for a minute or so &#8212; for the Iraqis?</p> \n\n<p>For these were the men who had the temerity, the sheer, unadulterated gall, to dress themselves up as Churchill, heroes who would stage a rerun of the Second World War, the BBC dutifully calling the invaders &#8220;the Allies&#8221; &#8212; they did, by the way &#8212; and painting Saddam&#8217;s regime as the Third Reich.</p> \n\n<p>Of course, when I was at school, our leaders &#8212; Attlee, Churchill, Eden, Macmillan, or Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy in the United States &#8212; had real experience of real war. Not a single Western leader today has any first-hand experience of conflict. When the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq began, the most prominent European opponent of the war was Jacques Chirac, who fought in the Algerian conflict. But he has now gone. So has Colin Powell, a Vietnam veteran but himself duped by Rumsfeld and the CIA.</p> \n\n<p>Yet one of the terrible ironies of our times is that the most bloodthirsty of American statesmen &#8212; Bush and Cheney, Rumsfeld and Wolfovitz &#8212; have either never heard a shot fired in anger or have ensured they did not have to fight for their country when they had the chance to do so. No wonder Hollywood titles like &#8220;Shock and Awe&#8221; appeal to the White House. Movies are their only experience of human conflict; the same goes for Blair and Brown.</p> \n\n<p>Churchill had to account for the loss of Singapore before a packed House. Brown won&#8217;t even account for Iraq until the war is over.</p> \n\n<p>It is a grotesque truism that today &#8212; after all the posturing of our political midgets five years ago &#8212; we might at last be permitted a valid seance with the ghosts of the Second World War. Statistics are the medium, and the room would have to be dark. But it is a fact that the total of US dead in Iraq (3,978) is well over the number of American casualties suffered in the initial D-Day landings at Normandy (3,384 killed and missing) on 6 June, 1944, or more than three times the total British casualties at Arnhem the same year (1,200).</p> \n\n<p>They count for just over a third of the total fatalities (11,014) of the entire British Expeditionary Force from the German invasion of Belgium to the final evacuation at Dunkirk in June 1940. The number of British dead in Iraq &#8212; 176 &#8212; is almost equal to the total of UK forces lost at the Battle of the Bulge in 1944-45 (just over 200). The number of US wounded in Iraq &#8212; 29,395 &#8212; is more than nine times the number of Americans injured on 6 June (3,184) and more than a quarter of the tally for US wounded in the entire 1950-53 Korean war (103,284).</p> \n\n<p>Iraqi casualties allow an even closer comparison to the Second World War. Even if we accept the lowest of fatality statistics for civilian dead &#8212; they range from 350,000 up to a million &#8212; these long ago dwarfed the number of British civilian dead in the flying-bomb blitz on London in 1944-45 (6,000) and now far outnumber the total figure for civilians killed in bombing raids across the United Kingdom &#8212; 60,595 dead, 86,182 seriously wounded &#8212; from 1940 to 1945.</p> \n\n<p>Indeed, the Iraqi civilian death toll since our invasion is now greater than the total number of British military fatalities in the Second World War, which came to an astounding 265,000 dead (some histories give this figure as 300,000) and 277,000 wounded. Minimum estimates for Iraqi dead mean that the civilians of Mesopotamia have suffered six or seven Dresdens or &#8212; more terrible still &#8212; two Hiroshimas.</p> \n\n<p>Yet in a sense, all this is a distraction from the awful truth in Buchanan&#8217;s warning. We have dispatched our armies into the land of Islam. We have done so with the sole encouragement of Israel, whose own false intelligence over Iraq has been discreetly forgotten by our masters, while weeping crocodile tears for the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who have died.</p> \n\n<p>America&#8217;s massive military prestige has been irreparably diminished. And if there are, as I now calculate, 22 times as many Western troops in the Muslim world as there were at the time of the 11th and 12th century Crusades, we must ask what we are doing. Are we there for oil? For democracy? For Israel? For fear of weapons of mass destruction? Or for fear of Islam?</p> \n\n<p>We blithely connect Afghanistan to Iraq. If only Washington had not become distracted by Iraq, so the narrative now goes, the Taliban could not have re-established themselves. But al-Qa&#8217;ida and the nebulous Osama bin Laden were not distracted. Which is why they expanded their operations into Iraq and then used this experience to assault the West in Afghanistan with the hitherto &#8212; in Afghanistan &#8212; unheard of suicide bomber.</p> \n\n<p>And I will hazard a terrible guess: that we have lost Afghanistan as surely as we have lost Iraq and as surely as we are going to &#8220;lose&#8221; Pakistan. It is our presence, our power, our arrogance, our refusal to learn from history and our terror &#8212; yes, our terror &#8212; of Islam that is leading us into the abyss. And until we learn to leave these Muslim peoples alone, our catastrophe in the Middle East will only become graver. There is no connection between Islam and &#8220;terror&#8221;. But there is a connection between our occupation of Muslim lands and &#8220;terror&#8221;. It&#8217;s not too complicated an equation. And we don&#8217;t need a public inquiry to get it right.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "The Only Lesson We Ever Learn Is That We Never Learn", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/the-only-lesson-we-ever-learn-is-that-we-never-learn/", "published_at": "2008-03-19", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>In the twelve-course meal that is the war in Iraq, America has just been served the first entree. The fight with Iraq&#8217;s state armed forces was merely the amuse-bouche. The subsequent guerilla war with the Baath, as distasteful as we found it, was still just the appetizer. Over the past two weeks, we have been presented with the first of the main courses, Fourth Generation war waged for religion. If, as is traditional, this is the fish course, our reaction suggests it is flounder.</p> \n\n<p>Frankly, I was surprised how quickly this dish arrived. It seems Mohammed&#8217;s kitchen is working rather more speedily than usual. While a broadening and intensifying of the anti-American resistance was inevitable, I did not think it would reach its present intensity until this summer. The fact that is has erupted so early has political as well as military implications. The full scope of our disaster in Syracuse&#8211;er, sorry, Iraq&#8211;may be evident before the party conventions, as well as prior to the fall election. Might Bush do an LBJ and choose not to run? Will a Kerry who voted for the war be a credible nominee? Military disaster can displace all sorts of certainties.</p> \n\n<p>It is not yet a disaster, some may say. On the tactical level, that is true, although it may not be true much longer. But on the strategic level it is not just one disaster, it is four:</p> \n\n<p>* * *</p> \n\n<p>The pretense that we came to &#8220;liberate&#8221; the Iraqi people and not as conquerors is no longer credible. Faced with a popular uprising, we effectively declared war on the people of Iraq. The overall American commander, General Abizaid, &#8220;gave a stark warning for the Iraqi fighters, from the minority Sunni as well as the majority Shiite populations,&#8221; according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. &#8220;&#8216;First, we are going to win,&#8217; Abizaid said, seated at a table in a marbled palace hall&#8230;&#8217;Secondly, everyone needs to understand that there is no more powerful force assembled on Earth than this military force in this country&#8230;'&#8221; That is the language of conquest, not liberation, and it destroys the legitimacy of America&#8217;s presence in Iraq, both locally and around the world.</p> \n\n<p>* * *</p> \n\n<p>We have now picked a fight with the Shiites, who control our lines of communication and who make up a majority of the Iraqi population. I thought that even the Valley of the Blind that is the CPA would have better sense than to make this final, fatal strategic blunder, but it seems they can always find a new ditch to stumble into. We did it over the utterly trivial matter of Muqtada al-Sadr&#8217;s newspaper printing lies&#8211;this from an American administration that long ago won the Order of Pinocchio, First Class, with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. While many Iraqi Shiites don&#8217;t much like al-Sadr, they like seeing Americans kill fellow Shiites even less.</p> \n\n<p>* * *</p> \n\n<p>The Marines threw away the opportunity to de-escalate the fighting with the Sunnis in Fallujah and instead have raised the intensity of anti-Americanism there. For months, the Marines trained for de-escalation. But because of one minor incident of barely tactical importance, the killing of four American contractors, the de-escalation strategy was thrown out the window and replaced by an all-out assault on an Iraqi city. The Marines may have been given no choice by the White House, but it also looks as if their own training did not go very deep; the Plain Dealer quoted a Marine battalion commander in Fallujah as saying, &#8220;What is coming is the destruction of anti-coalition forces in Fallujah. They have two choices: Submit or die.&#8221; That is hardly the language of de-escalation.</p> \n\n<p>* * *</p> \n\n<p>Finally, our whole &#8220;say good-bye at the end of June&#8221; strategy depends on the reliability of the Iraqi security forces we have been busy creating. But when faced with fighting their own people on behalf of Christian foreigners, most of them went over or went home. This was utterly predictable, but its effect is to leave us without any exit strategy at all.</p> \n\n<p>So what comes next? The current violence may follow a sine wave, ebbing and then flowing again, with the whole curve gradually trending up. Or, it may rise in a linear, accelerating curve, in which case we will soon be driven out of Iraq, possibly in a full-scale sauve que peut rout. The former appears more likely, but it still leads to the same ending, if taking a bit more time to get there. Unlike traditional twelve-course dinners, this one does not finish with a dessert or a savoury. It ends, to borrow one of John Boyd&#8217;s favorite phrases, with the &#8220;coalition&#8221; getting the whole enchilada right up the p&#8212; chute. You cannot get anything you want at Mohammed&#8217;s restaurant.</p> \n\n<p>WILLIAM S.

Is it really comparable to Lockheed Martin's F-35? IMAGE SOURCE: <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:FA-18F_Super_Hornet_Jolly_Rogers_edit_1.jpg\" type=\"external\">U.S. NAVY Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>As a negotiating tactic, the effort has merit. It embarrasses the president-elect's negotiating partners and gives them incentive to offer concessions, without requiring Trump and the taxpayers he will soon represent to make any concessions of their own. But in his latest social media salvo, President-elect Trump may have gone a bit too far.</p> \n\n<p>Last week, the soon-to-be-president challenged Boeing to produce \"a comparable F-18 Super Hornet\" at a price better than Lockheed Martin's F-35 -- which is curious. There is no such thing as a fourth-generation F -18 Super Hornet from Boeing that is comparable to a fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II from Lockheed.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>True, from a cosmetic viewpoint, both Boeing's F/A-18 and Lockheed's F-35 are fighter jets. Both planes have two wings, two vertical stabilizers and... fly. But that's about where the similarities end.</p> \n\n<p>Boeing's F/A-18 is a <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/06/30/boeings-fighter-jets-are-doomed-and-thats-ok.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">fourth-generation warbird Opens a New Window.</a>, designed for an era in which the U.S. would command air superiority from the get-go in almost any conflict. It operates at a quick tempo, picking up bombs and missiles from an aircraft carrier and delivering them to a target, with quick turnaround times. The F/A-18 doesn't worry about stealth, because it ain't got time for that -- it's got bombs to drop! But if you light up an F/A-18 with radar, it looks exactly like what it is -- a fighter jet -- and is relatively easy to track and target.</p> \n\n<p>Lockheed Martin's F-35, on the other hand, is a <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/05/08/did-lockheed-martins-f-35-stealth-fighter-just-get.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">fifth-generation fighter Opens a New Window.</a>, designed to combat advanced 21st-century opponents possessing robust air defenses. The F-35's radar absorbing skin and curious configuration make it invisible to radar. While certain very-high-frequency radars <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/10/19/did-china-just-render-americas-1-trillion-stealth.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">may be able to detect it Opens a New Window.</a>, the plane's radar cross-section on fire control radars is similar in size to a golf ball -- too small for fire control radar to lock onto it and guide a missile all the way to contact.</p> \n\n<p>Simply put, an F-35 is designed to survive threats that would take down an F/A-18. Thus, in modern warfare, F-35s would be deployed first to penetrate and take down an adversary's air defenses, after which the F/A-18s would swoop in to finish the job. The planes are thus complementary, not comparable.</p> \n\n<p>So is Donald Trump completely off his rocker? And if he isn't, what might Trump's F-35 tweet mean for Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and for their investors?</p> \n\n<p>Here's my take: The president-elect cannot be off his rocker, because the differences between Boeing's F/A-18 and Lockheed Martin's F-35 are too glaringly obvious for anyone to make a mistake this big, and this publicly. In addition to the differences noted, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps are currently the only services using Boeing's F/A-18, so the plane could not possibly be used to replace the <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/08/07/lockheed-martins-f-35b-stealth-fighter-wins-a-rare.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">1,750-odd F-35A stealth fighters Opens a New Window.</a> that the Air Force plans to buy -- just the 520 or so F-35-Bs and -Cs on order by the <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/02/22/us-navy-to-lockheed-martins-f-35-stealth-fighter-w.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Navy and Marines Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Of course, the president-elect couldn't go into all of these details in a 140-character tweet. But what might he have said if he had a bit more room to expand on his idea of a comparable F-18 Super Hornet, and what would the implications be then for investors?</p> \n\n<p>There are a couple of possibilities. For one, Boeing has for some years been working on design changes to the F/A-18 that the company contends would make it stealth-like -- if not completely stealthy. While Lockheed Martin would argue this is not comparable to its F-35, Trump may argue that Boeing's improvements are good enough to compete with the F-35 -- at the right price.</p> \n\n<p>Alternatively, Trump may be referring back to Boeing's X-32 aircraft, the stealth fighter Boeing entered in <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/news/2001/lmt011029.htm?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">the Joint Strike Fighter competition back in 2001 Opens a New Window.</a> -- the plane that ultimately lost to Lockheed Martin's F-35.</p> \n\n<p>As you recall, back then, the Pentagon had asked both companies to bid a plane they thought they could build for <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/05/08/did-lockheed-martins-f-35-stealth-fighter-just-get.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">about $35 million a copy Opens a New Window.</a> (in 1994 dollars). Arguably, <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/18/how-lockheed-martins-grand-plan-for-the-f-35-fell.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Lockheed broke that bargain Opens a New Window.</a> when, after winning the competition, it hiked the F-35's cost up to the $100 million or so a copy that the plane costs today. But if Boeing could dust off its plans for the X-32 and build the Air Force a stealthy fighter for something closer to the original asking price, that might be something that would interest Trump -- and Boeing -- very much. Thirty-five million dollars in 1994 dollars would be $57 million today, or about half the price that Lockheed is charging for the F-35. Granted, it would take Boeing significant investment to update its 2001 design and bid a new price on such a comparable F-18 (i.e., the X-32).</p> \n\n<p>But with the prospect of reintroducing competition to the fighter jet industry, and potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in Pentagon contracts at stake, Boeing just might bite.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than Boeing When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That hefty sum was reportedly in addition to the $7,000 the couple paid the government earlier this month.</p> \n\n<p>The dispute between the Kleins and Laurel and Rachel Bowman-Cryer, the lesbian couple who filed the complaint, began back in January of 2013.

NOT!&#8221;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The following story from Fox featuring an interview with Tucker Carlson and a host of migrant crime stats took the top slot earlier today on Google News.</p> \n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/02/20/trump-may-have-been-unclear-but-sweden-experiencing-migrant-crime-wave.html\" type=\"external\">Fox News, &#8220;Trump may have been unclear, but Sweden experiencing a migrant crime wave&#8221;</a>:</p> \n\n<p>Police investigator Peter Springare isn&#8217;t likely to be among those mocking President Trump for his remarks about refugees in Sweden.</p> \n\n<p>Trump&#8217;s comments during a Florida campaign rally on Saturday &#8211; which some took as a misstatement about a supposed terror attack &#8211; dovetail with what Springare has been seeing during a typical week in Orebro, Sweden. Five rapes, three assaults, a pair of extortions, blackmail, an attempted murder, violence against police and a robbery made up Springare&#8217;s caseload for a five-day period earlier this month, according to a Feb. 3 Facebook post he wrote. The suspects were all from Muslim-majority countries &#8211; Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia and Turkey &#8211; save for one Swedish man nabbed in a drug-related case.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&#8220;Mohammed, Mahmod, Ali, again and again,&#8221; Springare wrote of those arrested.</p> \n\n<p>Springare, who was briefly investigated for possible hate crime incitement based on his post, managed to elucidate what Trump only hinted at during a Florida campaign speech &#8211; somewhat opaquely.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&#8230;Last month, the police chief for the southern Swedish city of Malmo issued a desperate plea for help curtailing a plague of attempted murders, beatings and rapes. About 32 percent of Malmo&#8217;s occupants are migrants, although it is not clear what role migrants play in the crime wave.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We cannot do it on our own,&#8221; Chief Stefan Sinteus wrote in an open letter about the &#8220;upward spiral of violence.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>And Sinteus is not merely dealing with typical crimes that any modern city would witness.</p> \n\n<p>Malmo had 52 hand grenade attacks in 2016 alone, a jump from 48 attacks in 2015, according to figures provided by the Swedish Police Authority.</p> \n\n<p>Nationwide, the terror threat level is at &#8220;elevated&#8221; and police believe at least 300 Swedish nationals have travelled to Syria and Iraq for jihadi training. On Feb. 11, a Swedish man and a Danish man were arrested in Turkey, suspected of plotting to carry out attacks in Europe. Tofik Saleh, a 38-year-old Swedish citizen of Iraqi origin, had been training with ISIS since 2014, officials said.</p> \n\n<p>The left can&#8217;t respond to any of this.

No problem.</p> \n\n<p>After a tumultuous year of surreal corruption scandals involving exotic horses and the jailed billionaire scion and one of the most embarrassing recalls in the consumer electronics history, Samsung stunned investors with another improbable record: the South Korean tech giant may have earned more than Apple and ended Intel's quarter century dominance in the semiconductor industry.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Seemingly invincible Samsung Electronics appears set to log record annual profit this year as exploding use of data in mobile devices and the \"memory supercycle\" help it surmount the jailing of its de facto leader and sidestep losses from its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7s.</p> \n\n<p>South Korea's largest company reported Thursday record high quarterly profit and sales that likely will help it nudge aside Intel as the leading maker of semiconductors.</p> \n\n<p>Samsung also likely outstripped Apple in quarterly earnings for the first time as soaring use of connected devices and mobile data fueled demand for computer chips.</p> \n\n<p>Samsung's bottom line is better than ever, even with its vice chairman and de facto chief Lee Jae-yong jailed as part of a corruption scandal that unseated former South Korean president, Park Geun-hye.</p> \n\n<p>While Lee and Park battle allegations of bribery and other charges, Samsung is thriving thanks to tiny microchips called DRAM and NAND memory chips, which are needed to store and process data in servers and mobile devices.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Companies are adding server memory capacity to expand new server platforms and cloud services and handle artificial intelligence and other emerging services. Hardware manufacturers will likely increase orders of memory chips for smartphones as they launch new models later this year. Consumers also expect their handsets to be packed with higher memory storage, which increases memory demand.</p> \n\n<p>The unprecedented boom in the memory chip industry dubbed the \"memory super cycle\" helped push Samsung's April-June net income to 10.8 trillion won ($9.7 billion), up 85 percent from 5.8 trillion won a year earlier.</p> \n\n<p>Analysts had forecast 10.1 trillion won in net profit according to FactSet, a financial data provider.</p> \n\n<p>Operating profit jumped 73 percent over a year earlier to 14.1 trillion won ($12.7 billion) while sales rose 20 percent to 61 trillion won ($54.8 billion), in line with Samsung's earlier guidance.</p> \n\n<p>Despite relatively slow demand for smartphones and TVs, increased use of connected devices and mobile data is driving demand for server memory to store, analyze and process data. Memory chip prices have soared thanks to tight supply conditions, bringing unprecedented profitability to both Samsung and South Korea's No. 2 chip manufacturer, SK Hynix.</p> \n\n<p>Nearly 60 percent of Samsung's quarterly income was generated by its semiconductor division, which booked a record operating income of 8 trillion won ($7.2 billion) on sales of 17.6 trillion won ($15.8 billion).</p> \n\n<p>Samsung's other components business, which makes high-end display panels called OLED for smartphones, also saw solid gains in earnings after this spring's launch of new Samsung Galaxy smartphones using the advanced displays.</p> \n\n<p>The Galaxy S8 series of smartphones recorded higher sales than their predecessors, helping the company's mobile business rebound from last year's crisis over Galaxy Note 7s that had to be recalled and eventually discontinued because they tended to overheat or catch fire. That fiasco cost Samsung more than $5 billion last year.</p> \n\n<p>Samsung said its mobile business logged 4.1 trillion won ($3.7 billion) in operating profit. That is slightly lower than its year-earlier result due to higher component prices but nearly double the previous quarter's income</p> \n\n<p>The good times for Samsung appear likely to put it ahead of its rivals.</p> \n\n<p>Apple is forecast to report $8.2 billion in quarterly net profit when its financial results are disclosed on Tuesday, according to FactSet. April-June is typically a slow season for Apple.</p> \n\n<p>Intel, due to report its earnings later Thursday, is expected to book $14.4 billion in quarterly revenue.</p> \n\n<p>Looking ahead, Samsung said its third quarter profit may take a hit from marketing expenses from its upcoming launch in its new Galaxy Note series smartphone.</p> \n\n<p>But it still has a good chance of reporting its biggest annual earnings in its history this year.</p> \n\n<p>The outlook for semiconductor demand is robust and the overall profit during the second half will grow thanks to memory chips and its OLED screens, Samsung predicted.</p> \n\n<p>In the meantime, Samsung has largely insulated its day-to-day operations from Lee's legal troubles, though the longer term implications for Samsung's leadership remain unclear.</p> \n\n<p>Both Lee and Park have denied wrongdoing.

Most of the time, at least.</p> \n\n<p>When an affluent voter in a high tax bracket who owns a business and a nice house shows up and votes for a Republican, that is a rational decision. And when a lower-income voter who has little access to health care and pays rent to a landlord shows up to vote for a Democrat, that is also a rational decision.</p> \n\n<p>And for most of the population in most of the country, this is still how votes for the two parties break down: more affluent voters pull the lever for Republicans and less affluent voters do so for Democrats.</p> \n\n<p>If every adult living in the United States turned out to vote on every Election Day, and was forced to choose only between the two parties, it is almost certain that the Republican Party in its current form would lose not only the presidency but every state legislature and congressional race.</p> \n\n<p>The problem though is that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/income-gap-at-the-polls-113997\" type=\"external\">affluent people show up</a> on Election Day with a lot more frequency than the less affluent. The Republican-backed voter suppression laws have had a huge effect. But this predates that. Over the years the policy preferences of voters and nonvoters have diverged sharply, particularly when it comes to class-based issues. Voters are far more conservative when it comes to things like the welfare state, wealth inequality, and labor unions than nonvoters are. So if more of these nonvoters began to show up at the polls, we would suddenly have an electorate dramatically more supportive of the kind of social-democratic program favored by Sanders and his supporters.</p> \n\n<p>One explanation could be that the affluent party, the GOP, is much better and more consistent at rewarding electoral loyalty to their constituents through concrete, material economic policy than the less affluent party, the Democrats, is for their lower-income constituency. When George W. Bush took power, he delivered to his constituency immediately: capital gains and top marginal tax rates were slashed and the Department of Labor was gutted, making it harder for his voters&#8217; employees to check their bosses&#8217; power. More than sweet promises and a dozen roses once a year, the GOP put a ring on it.</p> \n\n<p>But when Obama took power, he passed the Heritage Foundation&#8217;s <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">health-care plan</a> and dropped organized labor&#8217;s central priority &#8212; the Employee Free Choice Act &#8212; even as he oversaw the Democratic Party&#8217;s greatest congressional majority in years. Regardless of whatever constraints he had and the small but real victories his administration offered for workers (Medicaid expansion, the overtime rule, etc.) it&#8217;s just true that his Republican predecessor delivered more to his affluent voters, and more quickly, than Obama did to his less affluent voters.</p> \n\n<p>The Republican Party is simply better at being a party of capital than the Democratic Party is at being a party of the working classes. And it&#8217;s not an accident.</p> \n\n<p>Last week, Seth Ackerman <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">wrote a piece</a> pushing back on <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/15/13286498/donald-trump-voters-race-economic-anxiety\" type=\"external\">Vox&#8217;s study</a> of lower-income Trump voters. He ended that essay with a pretty undeniable fact: despite all the talk of a GOP in decline, they control Congress and the vast majority of state governments. The party that had been beaten back into the minority for most of the twentieth century now, in the 2010s, can not only obstruct but govern. And perhaps one reason they&#8217;re able to have that power is due to the fact that there is a massive, untapped portion of the electorate &#8212; downscale whites&amp;#160; &#8212; who <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">just don&#8217;t vote</a> anymore.</p> \n\n<p>While we hear constantly that they&#8217;re demographically dying out, white workers without a college degree remain at least 63 percent of the working class and in twenty years, will be a &#8220;mere&#8221; 49.5 percent. That&#8217;s a ton of potential voters. Ackerman&#8217;s argument was that instead of writing off lower-income Trump supporters as hopeless racists who&#8217;ll always vote for white supremacy over their wallets, we should instead attempt to forge a broad, working-class political program that could win them over.</p> \n\n<p>Pretty quickly, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/789175810015932416\" type=\"external\">pundits</a> had a collective brain melt. How dare we argue that the left-of-center party use a working-class program to appeal to these working-class bigots! In one illuminating discussion, I saw a high-profile political commentator state that this was a ridiculous strategy because the Democratic Party already gets the non-racist share of the white working class to show up. And that the only way these poorer whites would come to the table is if the Democratic Party promised to explicitly or implicitly protect white supremacy.</p> \n\n<p>The implication here is that the huge number of low-income whites who simply stay home on Election Day (or the much smaller number who pull the lever for the GOP) can only be operating &#8212; or failing to operate &#8212; out of racism.</p> \n\n<p>It was suddenly clear: the liberal commentators who hold this view believe that their party and&amp;#160;its&amp;#160;record on both campaigning on and enacting a working-class program was so obviously good that to be a worker and fail to vote for the Democratic Party must signal some greater, all-encompassing ideological drive that overpowered class interest.</p> \n\n<p>To this punditocracy, that overriding ideology that thwarts a vote for &#8220;the working-class party&#8221; must be white supremacy. And thus this huge chunk of downscale white voters who don&#8217;t vote at all (and the smaller chunk who vote GOP) would only change their behavior if the Democratic Party became a White Man&#8217;s Party in the old Dixiecrat mold or if they somehow, sitting in their homes, managed to overcome their racism through personal enlightenment.</p> \n\n<p>This couldn&#8217;t be farther from the truth.</p> \n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at McDowell County, West Virginia. The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqceHviNBC4\" type=\"external\">zeroed in</a> on McDowell due to Trump winning 91.5 percent of the Republican primary vote. They of course left out the fact that more than three times as many Democratic Party ballots were cast and that nearly twice as many people voted for Sanders as voted for Trump &#8212; but we&#8217;ll give them a pass because at the time of the primary, the GOP race was effectively decided. Fair enough. McDowell County will likely go for Trump in November. Just as it did for Romney in 2012.</p> \n\n<p>And yet in 2008, Barack Obama won McDowell handily with 53 percent of the vote. Recent studies have shown that Obama won across the country in 2008 with <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/dems-need-better-answers-for-the-working-class.html\" type=\"external\">far more</a> white working-class voters than commonly thought. Even though he lost many of them four years later in 2012 &#8212; they either stayed home or went with Romney. Trump&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/upshot/the-new-blue-and-red-educational-split-is-replacing-the-culture-war.html\" type=\"external\">strength</a> in the Midwest this year appears to stem in part from white working-class ex-Obama voters. As one older, ex-mine worker in McDowell says to the Guardian, &#8220;I voted for that black guy two times.&#8221; He&#8217;s now with Trump.</p> \n\n<p>How does a liberal pundit explain this? If these voters are such obstinate racists who&#8217;ll always choose upholding &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; over their pocketbooks, why did they give Obama a shot in the first place? Did they think he wasn&#8217;t really black? Why didn&#8217;t they vote in 2008 like they did in 2012 and plan to in 2016? Did they simply expect Obama to help uphold white supremacy and, when he got into office, found that he acted &#8220;too radically for blackness&#8221;? Was inviting Jay-Z to the White House the moment where Obama lost the white working class forever?</p> \n\n<p>Or, perhaps, in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, Obama and his party simply <a href=\"http://theweek.com/articles/624777/obamas-biggest-failure\" type=\"external\">failed</a> to make the lives of voters in McDowell County substantially better. Since Obama, the Democrats have campaigned in every subsequent election under the galvanizing cry of &#8220;Hey, it <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">could&#8217;ve been worse</a>.&#8221; Maybe these McDowell voters question how it was that the wealthiest Americans recovered so quickly from the crash while they and their families and neighbors were worse off than ever.</p> \n\n<p>Is this really a crazy hypothesis? Staying home on Election Day or &#8212; in a two-party system &#8212; voting for &#8220;the other guys&#8221; is certainly something no left-of-center person wants to see. But it&#8217;s not an insane or necessarily ideological decision when your life has fallen apart during the eight years one particular party has held the White House. While Obama at least delivered Medicaid expansion to West Virginians, his presumptive successor campaigned on, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.&#8221; And while Clinton promised to enact programs to ease the loss of those livelihoods, Bill Clinton made similar promises about easing the job losses of NAFTA. To no one&#8217;s surprise, they didn&#8217;t materialize. I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s some <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">well-earned skepticism</a>.</p> \n\n<p>When it comes to the nature of the white working class, I agree with civil rights leader Bayard Rustin: they are neither inherently conservative nor liberal. Which way they break is determined by politics and organization &#8212; not destiny or their whiteness.</p> \n\n<p>Racism can be fought, defeated, or overruled by working-class politics. Or it can be brought front and center. As Ackerman pointed out in his article, West Virginia in the 1920s was a bastion of reaction &#8212; the KKK and coal operators <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">ran the state</a>. In the 1930s and up through the 1970s, it was a hotbed of labor unions, class struggle, and a hell of a lot of Democratic Party votes. Hubert Humphrey, who rose to prominence for his commitment to both civil rights and the welfare state, crushed Richard Nixon and George Wallace in West Virginia with 49.6 percent of the vote. Was this because the whites of West Virginia were simply less racist than the whites of Georgia, who helped Wallace carry their state? Or was it because West Virginia was the site of class struggle and labor politics in a way that Georgia at that time was not?</p> \n\n<p>In fact, the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">greatest determinant</a> of whether a white working-class person votes GOP or Democrat is still whether or not he or she is in a labor union. A union is, after all, an organization that, ideally, keeps its members focused on their material, class interests even between elections. They build solidarity between people who might otherwise dislike, distrust, or even hate each other. They keep working people focused on their inherent commonality in a way that no privilege-checking session, feel-good campaign ad, or BuzzFeed quiz ever can. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re powerful. And that&#8217;s why the rich despise them.</p> \n\n<p>And while labor-union membership has been in decline overall for decades now, the potential for workers to organize is as strong as ever &#8212; even under twenty-first-century capitalism. As sociologist Beverly Silver <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">has pointed out</a>, the spread of just-in-time production means a relatively small number of workers still &#8220;can bring an entire corporation to a standstill.&#8221; And even with globalization, &#8220;the potential geographical scale of the impacts of these stoppages has increased.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Even today strategies and technologies to diminish workers&#8217; rights in education and transportation have resulted in the first stirrings of union drives from charter school teachers and Uber drivers. As much as we hear otherwise, capitalism will always need workers to make their profits and will thus always be vulnerable to the potential of organized labor. That is the core truth of a capitalist economy that Marxists understand &#8212; no matter how zany we can get about other things &#8212; and that liberals do not.</p> \n\n<p>It also means we&#8217;re inoculated from other catechisms that bear no resemblance to the historical record. The belief that &#8220;racism&#8221; is a transhistorical phenomenon that can and will always destroy working-class solidarity is not only <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">wrong</a>, it fundamentally aligns &#8212; almost like an ideological partnership &#8212; with the same belief we hear in the press all the time that organized labor can only hope to manage its extinction and nothing more. And that the working classes are obsolete.</p> \n\n<p>Together, these beliefs &#8212; perpetual racism and the hopelessness of labor fighting back against capital &#8212; form a politics that is fundamentally conservative. And in this retreat from a politics of class solidarity and working-class self-determination, the professional classes have stepped in and taken the wheel.</p> \n\n<p>Today, the Democratic Party can count on the votes of millions of working-class Americans, largely people of color. And yet it&#8217;s an open secret that the party&#8217;s program is led by the affluent professional class at best and enlightened Silicon Valley billionaires at worst. Obama himself <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/barack-obama-venture-capitalist\" type=\"external\">has hinted</a> that he&#8217;s interested in going into venture capital after his presidency. Organized labor &#8212; always a junior partner in the Democratic Party even at its height &#8212; is now something closer to Donny in The Big Lebowski. Frail, meek and at death&#8217;s door, he must always &#8220;shut the fuck up.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>That means that while this form of liberal politics can probably scare up enough votes to win a few elections, it&#8217;s fundamentally incapable of not only governing but of changing society for the better. It surrenders Congress and the majority of state legislatures to the most fiendish right-wing maniacs in the country. And it&#8217;s a politics that&#8217;s fundamentally limited even in its ability to help fight racial discrimination.</p> \n\n<p>After all, the two most significant and expansive pieces of federal legislation on civil rights in the twentieth century were signed by two presidents who won the votes of the white working class &#8212; Harry Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson. And it was Walter Reuther&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/united-auto-workers-convention-speech\" type=\"external\">United Auto Workers</a> that provided financial support to Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement &#8212; not &#8220;woke&#8221; corporate executives.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s true that working-class politics has been torn apart by racial strife in the past but the opposite is equally true. Black and white workers in the Jim Crow South were able to organize unions together even if racist political appeals always had to be fought off. How strange it is to believe that a white forty-year-old worker in 2016 is just as much or more driven by racial animosity than his Southern 1937 Jim Crow equivalent. (A recent Reuters survey puts Trump&#8217;s support among non-college Southern whites at 55 percent for those over fifty years of age, but only 39 percent for those forty-nine and younger.) And as much as liberals like to point out that the supposed &#8220;bellwether&#8221; Macomb County, Michigan &#8212; the home of many unionized autoworkers &#8212; went for Nixon in 1968 and Reagan in 1980, it is equally true that they repeatedly reelected David Bonior, one of the most left-wing members of the House of Representatives. In 1976, even at the height of the busing riots, Carter won the county, just as he won the nation&#8217;s entire white working-class vote, North and South.</p> \n\n<p>Politics, especially working-class politics, is complicated. Well-funded reactionaries will always be able to find weak points in such a coalition. That doesn&#8217;t mean that &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; is destiny. In 1980, Reagan did in fact win working-class whites &#8212; but with the exception of black voters, he won pretty much every demographic that year. Even ones that had historically gone for Democrats. Women, Catholics, you name it. Yet studies in 1984 showed that most people sided with the Democratic Party on questions of welfare spending. They just believed that the Democrats, unlike Reagan, were incompetent at managing the economy.</p> \n\n<p>Is that racism? Or is it the fact that Carter put the economy into recession in order to save bondholders? This is the president who went on television to tell working Americans that from now on, they&#8217;d have to do more with less. The president whose appointee to the chair of the Federal Reserve, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Paul Volcker</a>, said in 1979: &#8220;The standard of living of the average American has to decline.&#8221; I&#8217;d call that a pretty good indicator that his party wasn&#8217;t that interested in its working-class constituents.</p> \n\n<p>After all, &#8220;doing more with less&#8221; certainly didn&#8217;t apply to the wealthy of this country. Do liberals think the working classes simply wouldn&#8217;t notice that this new frugal standard applied only to themselves? While Reagan ran on &#8220;Morning in America,&#8221; the Democrats became the party of austerity and balanced budgets. Dukakis, in his 1988 convention biopic, was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/06/us/more-wealth-than-meets-the-eye-lies-behind-frugal-dukakis-image.html?pagewanted=all\" type=\"external\">depicted</a> as mowing his own lawn with an old-fashioned push-mower. Apparently, a gasoline-powered motor would just be too decadent.</p> \n\n<p>The pundit class, however, can&#8217;t see these flaws. As members of wealthy, coastal communities, its backers see only the symbolic achievements of the twenty-first-century Democrats and none of the failures. We are talking about a class <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trumpism-is-a-politics-of-loss-and-revenge\" type=\"external\">of</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/789175810015932416\" type=\"external\">people</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/08/angry-white-men-love-donald-trump\" type=\"external\">who</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/opinion/trump-reflects-white-male-fragility.html\" type=\"external\">believe</a> <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/04/30/we_must_shame_dumb_trump_fans_the_white_working_class_are_not_victims/\" type=\"external\">the</a> anger and bitterness of white working-class middle Americans in 2016 is rooted in the anxiety that &#8220;their whiteness has lost its value.&#8221; No, it couldn&#8217;t be that they&#8217;ve lost their livelihoods, families, or homes &#8212; it&#8217;s that they&#8217;ve just been told George Wallace isn&#8217;t coming to save them after all. It&#8217;s not only not true, it&#8217;s garbage politics.&amp;#160;In effect, it is nothing more than academic jargon used by the affluent to dismiss and slander working people&#8217;s rightful belief that as a society grows far wealthier (as the United States has over the past several decades), they&#8217;re entitled to rising expectations &#8212; not diminished ones.</p> \n\n<p>Thanks to WikiLeaks, we now know that Apple CEO Tim Cook and Bill Gates &#8212; the billionaire who has been leading the movement to destroy public education &#8212; both made it onto <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13315952/hillary-clinton-wikileaks-running-mate-tim-cook-bill-gates\" type=\"external\">Clinton&#8217;s shortlist</a> for running-mate. This is the party rejected by white workers supposedly out of &#8220;racism&#8221; and nothing more &#8212; not the party of civil rights and Medicare. The obstinate belief that good and sincere pro-labor politicians like Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren, Tom Perez, and Keith Ellison are in the driver&#8217;s seat of the Democratic Party is simply a delusion. If the Democratic Party is Madison Square Garden, then Andrew Cuomo, Chuck Schumer, and the Clintons sit courtside, chatting with the players. Sanders, Warren, and Brown are up in the nosebleeds.</p> \n\n<p>So what is to be done when the Democratic Party of 2016 can win neither Congress nor the majority of state governments? According to the pundit class, we&#8217;re supposed to just wait. A decade or two. Instead of adopting Sanders&#8217;s class politics to <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">win over</a> the entire working class, many liberal pundits would prefer we simply wait twenty years when the white working class will no longer be a majority of workers. Demography, they seem to believe, is political destiny. Somehow, I kind of doubt that an eighty-six year-old senator Chuck Schumer will announce in the year 2036 that his party intends to finally &#8220;extinguish the billionaire class.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>I can understand how appealing it is to believe that it&#8217;s simply &#8220;miserable, angry whites&#8221; and their racism that&#8217;s holding back the Democratic Party from becoming either a social-democratic powerhouse or one that can at least expand on the achievements of its mid-century golden age all over again. It certainly seems easier to just wait patiently than to fight some of the most powerful people in the country for control over a party that is, structurally, far more theirs than ours &#8212; likely, irrevocably so.</p> \n\n<p>But demographics won&#8217;t turn the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">party of Silicon Valley</a> into the party of Chicago&#8217;s South Side or West Virginia&#8217;s coal country. All that waiting will do is prolong the undeniable suffering felt both by Trump and Clinton&#8217;s working-class supporters &#8212; and the large number of low-income Americans who don&#8217;t vote at all. Because that suffering isn&#8217;t exclusive to downscale Trumpists &#8212; &#8220;the deplorables&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s everyone who works or desperately hopes to work for a measly wage in order to survive. In other words, not the pundits who have next to nothing in common with them.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just &#8220;vulgar class-first&#8221; issues where the Democrats are failing &#8212; the party&#8217;s nationwide marginalization means, in much of the country, it&#8217;s been decades since it&#8217;s been this difficult to start or join a labor union or have access to abortion services. Despite having largely shed the &#8220;racist&#8221; white working class from the Democrat&#8217;s electoral coalition, the black-white wage gaps are now <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/black-white-wage-gaps-expand-with-rising-wage-inequality/\" type=\"external\">larger today</a> than they were in 1979. And therein lies the central irony of the Democrats&#8217; tighter rhetorical embrace of social liberalism alongside a staunch rejection of populist class politics: they actually made far more progress on the former when they were a party capable of the latter.</p> \n\n<p>The belief that bringing in the nonvoting white working class requires surrendering on commitments to gender equality and antiracism is simply that &#8212; a belief. Sanders simultaneously attracted the support of white working-class voters in states like Indiana, Wisconsin, and Michigan even as he repeatedly championed Black Lives Matter and the fight against racial discrimination. There was no Sister Souljah moment with Bernie. The idea that bringing in certain segments of the working class automatically negates the coalition&#8217;s commitment to social liberalism is a myth.</p> \n\n<p>Among non-Evangelical Protestants, black voters still disproportionately <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2016/05/12/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/\" type=\"external\">oppose same-sex marriage</a> even as they disproportionately vote Democratic. In 2008, African-American Protestants strongly supported Prop 8 in California. By our punditocracy&#8217;s &#8220;working-class contaminant&#8221; theory, the Democratic Party would be forced to choose here between commitment to same-sex marriage and their black Protestant voters. Yet neither has been &#8220;purged&#8221; from the coalition. And, steadily, progress has been made &#8212; far more Democrats, black Protestants, and Americans support same-sex marriage now than they did fifteen years ago.</p> \n\n<p>So while we&#8217;re told about just how insane white workers are for voting the way they do, I frankly don&#8217;t find it surprising. Many still vote for today&#8217;s affluent, professional-class Democratic Party with low expectations. Some, with no labor union or political organization to corral them, fall back onto reactionary prejudices and throw in with people like Trump for the worst reasons.</p> \n\n<p>And most, understandably, just stay home on Election Day. Until we change that fact, social justice in the United States will continue to remain out of reach for everyone who has to work for a living.</p>", "title": "This Didn\u2019t Have to Happen", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://jacobinmag.com/2016/10/democratic-party-clinton-trump-white-voters-workers/", "published_at": "2018-10-04", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>F. Scott Fitzgerald&#8217;s 1926 short story &#8220;The Rich Boy&#8221; opens with the line &#8220;Let me tell you about the very rich. They are different from you and me.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s 2015, and the decadence that differentiates the very rich is still a uniquely American obsession. And while the narrators have changed and the stories have shifted, we&#8217;re still listening. Wednesday Martin&#8217;s <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Primates of Park Avenue</a> recently made headlines for its detailed, pseudo-anthropological study of the Upper East Side and its rarified inhabitants. The memoir is small enough to fit in a Birkin, but with the kind of explosive potential that gets you permanently barred from Temple Emanu-El. It charts the progress of Upper East Side mothers with the thoroughness of a serial killer and the eye of a Bloomingdale&#8217;s head shopper. Martin jots down details ranging from drinks of choice (anything alcoholic) to trending exercise regimens (if you have to ask, you&#8217;ll never be in the SoulCycle front row). From summers spent at Long Island&#8217;s East Egg&#8212;I mean East End&#8212;to alleged &#8220;wife bonuses,&#8221; no tidbit is too personal.</p> \n\n<p>The Upper East Side Mom is similarly studied in Bravo&#8217;s new scripted TV show <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Odd Mom Out</a>. Odd Mom Out follows one quirky mother, played by Upper East Side native Jill Kargman, as she navigates the world of Rockefellers, Roman numerals, and really, really rich people.</p> \n\n<p>The Upper East Side has always held pop cultural appeal, from F. Scott Fitzgerald to The Official Preppy Handbook. More recently, a glut of TV shows including Gossip Girl, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">The Real Housewives of New York City</a>, and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">NYC Prep</a> have attempted to offer a penthouse window view of Manhattan&#8217;s elite. These shows are all fueled by an appetite that combines fantasy and righteous contempt, and they trade in stereotypes that recycle an unbelievable, ratings-pandering approximation of the Upper East Side that&#8217;s as unreal, tragic, and glamorous as Jay Gatsby himself. Like all TV shows that weren&#8217;t created by Shonda Rhimes, they follow a predictable recipe for maximum sleaze, shock, and envy, and revolve around predictable obsessions: prep schools, absentee parents, lavish parties, insane real estate, and designer clothes.</p> \n\n<p>The Upper East side that spans around thirty blocks and a handful of avenues on the island of Manhattan contains a number of elite private schools, many of them single-sex, all boasting high average SAT scores and fro-yo machines with a range of flavors. The non-existent, magical Upper East Side that exists in the minds of Real Housewives and Gossip Girl fan club presidents is a whole different story. In Primates of Park Avenue, housewives are totally high on higher education. Ivy League admission is presented not as the goal but as the norm&#8212;attending the most expensive pre-schools and private academies is a progeny prerequisite, and having a Princeton-degreed daddy isn&#8217;t the golden ticket it used to be. Martin <a href=\"http://www.popsugar.com/moms/Primates-Park-Avenue-Book-Excerpt-37646805\" type=\"external\">writes</a>, &#8220;The specter of failing to land one's child in an elite school&#8212;in the altered ecology of the Upper East Side, this was the terrifying predator to be outwitted and bested.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But according to shows like Gossip Girl and NYC Prep, the real challenge isn&#8217;t landing a spot in an elite private school, but rather surviving the best education you can buy your way into. Every girl&#8217;s book bag is designer, every boy owns an ascot and a boat in Maine, and being from Brooklyn is enough to merit social pariah status. Disappointingly enough, most of these juicy descriptions read more like the work of a private school creative writing class than an accurate reflection of reality&#8212;not that most traditional prep schools offer hippie classes like creative writing, which would be impossible to fit into a schedule packed with four AP&#8217;s, Latin, and Greek.</p> \n\n<p>For one thing, not everyone at these schools is a Blair Waldorf. I attended one of the oldest private schools in New York, a school so status-obsessed that it actually boasts of being the longest continuously run school in Manhattan&#8212;because it sided with the British. While I saw my share of Cartier love bracelets floundering around on the wrists of 15-year-old girls, the over-spending was far more contained and far less evocative of the fall of the Roman Empire than television would have you believe. No one was mocked for wearing Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch jeans or Gap polo shirts. We did not all live on Park or summer in the Hamptons. In fact, I don&#8217;t think I ever heard summer sincerely used as a verb until I watched the first few episodes of Odd Mom Out. People actually worked hard; a rich boy like Chuck Bass would not be able to earn a diploma simply by repeating the motto of &#8220;I&#8217;m Chuck Bass&#8221; to school administrators (or club bouncers, for that matter).</p> \n\n<p>Gossip Girl relied on the premise that rich Upper East Siders can buy, do, and get away with anything. It centered on drugs, sex, and parties, and looked more like a Madonna-envisioned bacchanalia than any teenager&#8217;s lived existence. Upper East Siders are actually just like other teenagers&#8212;they smoke pot in parks, hang out in living rooms with their friends, and try to convince people to buy them alcohol.</p> \n\n<p>On NYC Prep, the tragically singular first season culminates in a lavish gala. On Gossip Girl, everyone and their literal mothers are obsessed with debutante balls, the WASP-y ceremony where young girls symbolically enter society. The debutante ball is another excuse for Blair, Serena, and their interchangeable arm candy to don Net-a-Porter level couture and drink and bicker like adults. For the record, debutante balls are the purview of a few, very traditional families. Similarly galas, like weekly drinks at Lavo, are a largely fantastical element of the Upper East Side experience, at least for the younger set. And when/if Upper East Side kids go out they have to use fake ID&#8217;s, just like the rest of us&#8212;having a trust fund and living on 70th and Park doesn&#8217;t magically make you look like Blake Lively.</p> \n\n<p>Speaking of addresses, pop culture seems particularly obsessed with the geography of wealth. In multiple interviews, Odd Mom Out&#8217;s Jill Kargman <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/11/fashion/in-odd-mom-out-mining-the-upper-east-side-for-comedy-gold.html\" type=\"external\">describes her neighborhood</a> as &#8220;Durito, for &#8216;Down under the Roosevelt Island Tram Pass.&#8217;&#8221; This differentiation between the fabled, gold-paved sidewalks of the iconic upper East and Kargman&#8217;s more humble real estate seems like a deliberate attempt at self-deprecation, equal parts reliable punch line and serious attempt to cast Kargman as an outsider amongst insiders. This subtle distinction allows Kargman&#8217;s Bravo character to parody the Upper East Side even as a one-percenter participant.</p> \n\n<p>Pop culture approximations of the fabulously wealthy make a huge mistake in limiting their purview to one piece of Manhattan. Wolves of Wall Street mark out their territory everywhere from gorgeous townhouses in TriBeCa to Upper West Side apartments. Yes, they even live in Brooklyn (not to mention Tenafly and Scarsdale). The most laughable moments on Gossip Girl are when insiders like Blair shamelessly mock Brooklyn boy Dan for his pauper&#8217;s loft in Williamsburg. The aforementioned loft, which could easily cover Dwell magazine and sell for millions, is offered as shorthand for outsider status. The implication is that the truly wealthy wouldn&#8217;t dare leave the bubble of the Upper East Side; that privilege exclusively presents as a building with a doorman, an implicit dress code, and a view of the Met. This same erroneous logic fuels the much-repeated myth that Upper East Siders don&#8217;t go downtown, or have never set foot on the subway. Even if you attended a mythical school like Dan and Blair did, you&#8217;ve probably still heard of gentrification.</p> \n\n<p>More importantly, the assumption that Dan and his sister Jenny&#8217;s real estate porn loft caused them extreme social discomfort erases the experience of those who truly deviate from the norm in prep school&#8212;students of color and kids who exist in a socioeconomic strata that&#8217;s markedly lower than their relatively wealthy peers. Despite <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/12/when-minority-students-attend-elite-private-schools/282416/\" type=\"external\">well-publicized diversity programs</a>, NYC private schoolers often self-segregate according to race or socioeconomic status. This phenomenon might explain, but does not justify, the lily-whiteness of shows like NYC Prep and Gossip Girl, where ambiguously ethnic characters are occasionally seen but rarely heard&#8212;transparent casting decisions that inadvertently mirror many real-life experiences of tokenization.</p> \n\n<p>Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.</p> \n\n<p>A speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).</p> \n\n<p>While living in Brooklyn is not realistic social suicide, Gossip Girl&#8217;s insistence on manufacturing a misfit is extremely telling. The myth of the Upper East Side is, after all, founded on the premise of privilege and exclusion. The 1 percent implies the other 99, outsiders with television sets and a complicated relationship to wealth that&#8217;s equal parts demonization and deification. Like all constructions, the Upper East Side serves a multitude of purposes, and is ultimately a reflection of those who are behind the lens, not under it. Almost every representation of the neighborhood features an outsider figure.</p> \n\n<p>In The Great Gatsby, narrator Nick Carraway famously &#8220;liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter their lives.&#8221; While NYC Prep&#8217;s token public schooler Taylor DiGiovanni never cited classic literature, her story is an extension of Nick&#8217;s: outsider fantasizes about entering the world of the elite, admires their designer labels and lavish circumstances, but is ultimately disenchanted by the superficiality and brutality of the pretty lives that pass her by.</p> \n\n<p>Similarly, when Gossip Girl&#8217;s Dan begins to associate with the upper echelon, fellow Brooklynite Vanessa narrates, &#8220;The outsider goes inside. A likable everyman's pursuit of his dream girl begins his descent into the bowels of hell. This is mythic stuff.&#8221; The couch-surfer pop psychology at work here is not difficult to analyze. We project on these outsiders, whose fringe existences highlight both the possibility of party crashing and the alluring exclusivity of the upper crust. The mythic Upper East Side is a classic, ivy-covered brick fa&#231;ade that doubles as a fortress. Through the eyes of the outsider, we are allowed to dream and aspire, and are ushered into a world that&#8217;s mirage-like in its decadence. Of course, that&#8217;s because it is a mirage, and our interlopers often find themselves unable to integrate and are ultimately cast out, thrust back into the &#8220;real world&#8221; of public school boyfriends and Brooklyn coffee shops.</p> \n\n<p>The trailer for 'Gossip Girl.'</p> \n\n<p>While this voyeuristic exercise allows the viewer a degree of fantasy-fulfillment, it also acts as a foil. The superficiality of the portrayed elite in tell-alls like Primates of Park Avenue and Odd Mom Out serves to highlight and reinforce the humility, humor, and all-around goodness of the outside observer. While Martin and Kargman might outwardly aspire to belong, they are also presented as more intelligent, self-aware, and present than their Upper East Side counterparts. This idolization of the outsider is especially prevalent at moments when the complicated American relationship towards insane wealth accumulation tips more towards admonishment than admiration.</p> \n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/12/xoxo-conspicuous-consumption-how-the-economy-killed-gossip-girl/266181/\" type=\"external\">the Atlantic pointed out</a>, Gossip Girl was actually a victim of the recession. &#8220;When banks began to fail and the market plummeted in October 2008, a few episodes into Gossip Girl's second season, public opinion turned swiftly and dramatically against the very rich.&#8221; Aspiring to join the one percent became as pass&#233; as Tory Burch flats. We didn&#8217;t want to envy the ultra-rich&#8212;we wanted to crucify them. Cue the rising popularity of The Real Housewives of New York City, which was first aired in 2008. The real housewives, with their tacky dreams of fame and fortune and their televised social lives and squabbles, deconstructed the Upper East Side as it lampooned its inhabitants. Inverting Fitzgerald&#8217;s outsider&#8217;s fantasy, the show insisted that these wealthy residents were in fact just like us, that we could easily be Upper East Siders&#8212;if we were money-hungry socialites with surgically removed moral compasses. At the height of our hatred, we stopped looking in and sought to break through the penthouse windows&#8212;busting into private lives and passing judgment on the privileged.</p> \n\n<p>Odd Mom Out and Primates of Park Avenue are products of a post-recession era. According to <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/01/the-rise-of-the-new-global-elite/308343/\" type=\"external\">Holly Peterson</a>, the author of the Upper East Side-centric novel The Manny, &#8220;There&#8217;s so much money on the Upper East Side right now. If you look at the original movie Wall Street, it was a phenomenon where there were men in their 30s and 40s making $2 and $3 million a year, and that was disgusting. But then you had the Internet age, and then globalization, and you had people in their 30s, through hedge funds and Goldman Sachs partner jobs, who were making $20, $30, $40 million a year.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>American dreamers are reverting to that potent mix of envy and admiration; fear of an increasing wealth disparity combined with a deep desire to wind up on the right side of the widening gap. The sleazy, semi-exploitation of the Housewives era is being combined with the classic envious outsider narrative. Martin and Kargman are self-congratulatory commentators who live in the world they parody. They might come across as smarter than the other members of their keratin&#8217;d clan, but they&#8217;ve still chosen to live on the Upper East Side in the first place. Martin is a wealthy woman with a Birkin of her own, and real-life Kargman is the UES bred daughter of a former Chanel president. As befitting a capitalist society that borders on plutocracy, the outsiders are looking more and more like insiders, as the bubble between the haves and the have-nots is growing a visibly thicker and less permeable skin.</p>", "title": "Why We Love to Loathe Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side: From F.

Last month, Germany passed a new law threatening fines of up to $57 million for companies that don't comply quickly enough.</p> \n\n<p>Taxes have been a particular pressure point. Politicians in countries such as France and the U.K. have said tech giants declare too little profit in their countries and then manage to reduce whatever profit they do declare elsewhere in Europe by paying huge untaxed royalty fees that often end up in tax havens.</p> \n\n<p>Several European countries, other than France, have pursued Google for back taxes. Spain raided Google offices in Madrid last year, and the company earlier this year to pay Italian tax authorities EUR306 million ($349 million).</p> \n\n<p>The EU last year demanded that Ireland recoup as much as EUR13 billion ($14.8 billion) in back taxes from Apple Inc. stemming from profits the EU said Apple should have declared as taxable in Ireland, and it is investigating whether Amazon.com Inc. should owe back taxes to Luxembourg. Apple is appealing, and Amazon has said it pays all the tax it owes.</p> \n\n<p>The threat of legal action -- coupled with new tax rules proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and a new \"diverted profits tax\" in the U. K. -- has led companies to make structural changes. Last year, Facebook began directing U.K. clients to start paying an affiliate in the country rather than funneling that money through Ireland and then on to the Cayman Islands, boosting its tax payments in the U.K.</p> \n\n<p>Google also made a controversial tax deal with the U.K. that involves attributing more income to that country, therefore paying more taxes there.</p> \n\n<p>The French case indicates, however, that there may be limits to tax authorities' efforts to make significant clawbacks of taxes under existing laws.</p> \n\n<p>Similar to how Google operates in other large EU countries, its French unit doesn't sell ads to French customers, but rather offers only logistical and marketing support to the Google unit in Ireland that closes the advertising deals.

Why? Fundamental to the crisis is the degree of federation it already has. Seventeen economically disparate nations bound their fortunes together in creating the euro zone, and it is exactly this that has thrown the European project into crisis.</p> \n\n<p>Large parts of the populations of Greece, Spain and Portugal have been forced into destitution; the economies of all 17 members of the euro zone have been gravely damaged; governments of the weaker countries have been stripped of policy autonomy and placed under the tutelage of a &#8220;troika&#8221; of foreigners from the EU Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, who are imposing uniform, highly controversial and thus far generally unsuccessful austerity programs.</p> \n\n<p>How would a strengthened European federation improve this situation? Advocates of federation can argue that if the individual states of the EU were under federal authority, they would not have been allowed to get into their present plight. But most of the damage was done by innocent submission of credulous policymakers to the conventional wisdom of the international marketplace, the self-interested advice and investment promotions of the international investment banks, and discredited academic theories of deregulated and autonomous &#8220;perfect&#8221; markets. If the European Union had become a federation when it expanded in 2004, can we believe that its leaders would have done otherwise? The whole European economy might be in worse shape than it is now.</p> \n\n<p>The writer Timothy Garton Ash wants Europe to &#8220;save&#8221; itself by &#8220;moving toward closer fiscal and political union.&#8221; This is Angela Merkel&#8217;s position as well. From Chancellor Merkel&#8217;s viewpoint, this might seem a solution because it implies a much more influential role for Germany. I think she underestimates the resistance of the smaller European countries to any federal authority (or indeed, to adoption of such a project).</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Would federal authority have an answer to the authoritarian trends in the present internal politics of Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania &#8212; the kind of practices that gave the Balkans a bad name in the past? What can be expected from such candidate members as Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia in a new federation? Garton Ash knows the Balkans much better than most people, as well as the mafias in that part of Europe.</p> \n\n<p>The United States is usually cited by Europeans as an example of successful federation. It was in the beginning a group of 13 states with a shared language, literature, history, a common intellectual and moral formation, Christian religious values (despite major sectarian differences), and which possessed common expectations and understandings of politics and history. Nonetheless, the objections of the Southern states to yielding what originally had been understood as irrevocable state sovereignty were only overcome by a terrible civil war.</p> \n\n<p>The degree of integration and political agreement the major powers of Europe now have achieved came after centuries of rivalry among the British, Germanic, French, Spanish, Danish and Swedish peoples, to speak only of the traditional great powers of Western Europe, plus a profusion of wars culminating in two immense wars fought in nearly every quarter of the world. To think this is all over, and that European history has come to an end, defies the global political landscape of the present day.</p> \n\n<p>NATO&#8217;s Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen does his best to prepare and arm the European members of the alliance for &#8220;key security threats from global challenges.&#8221; Would a European federation go abroad to fight global threats? Which ones? European analysts argue that Europe&#8217;s present quasi-disarmed condition forfeits global influence. It does, but are Germany, Sweden, Slovenia, Macedonia, Italy, Spain and all the others in the EU prepared to commit troops to a European foreign expeditionary army to recover Europe&#8217;s world influence?</p> \n\n<p>To my foreigner&#8217;s eyes, the future of Europe best lies in the union it already possesses. I am confident that the euro can and should survive, but possibly as part of a double-currency system in economically weaker countries, where the euro would function as the international exchange currency and the reference value for floating national currencies.</p> \n\n<p>There would be a common foreign policy exercising probably the world&#8217;s most powerful armory of the instruments of &#8220;soft&#8221; power. The major European states, the former &#8220;great powers,&#8221; could individually or cooperatively, according to their choice, play an armed role in the external world, as they do now, with such support and endorsement as their fellow EU members may wish to provide. In circumstances now unforeseeable, the Union as a whole might wish to adopt common defensive and deterrent measures. Europe in this way could be a different global &#8220;great power.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Visit William Pfaff&#8217;s website for more on his latest book, &#8220;The Irony of Manifest Destiny: The Tragedy of America&#8217;s Foreign Policy&#8221; (Walker &amp;amp; Co., $25), at <a href=\"http://www.williampfaff.com\" type=\"external\">www.williampfaff.com</a>. &#169; 2012 Tribune Media Services, Inc.</p>", "title": "The Root of Europe's Problem", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/the-root-of-europes-problem/", "published_at": "2012-09-05", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>U.S. job growth likely slowed in August after two straight months of robust gains, but the pace of increase should be more than sufficient for the Federal Reserve to announce a plan to start trimming its massive bond portfolio.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>According to a Reuters survey of economists, the Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday will probably show that nonfarm payrolls increased by 180,000&amp;#160;jobslast month.</p> \n\n<p>That would be close to the 184,000 monthly average employment gains for this year and far more than what is needed to keep up with growth in the work-age population.</p> \n\n<p>While the job gains would clear the path for the U.S. central bank to outline a plan to start shrinking its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting, tepid wage growth could leave a December interest rate increase in doubt.</p> \n\n<p>Average hourly earnings are forecast rising 0.2 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in June, likely keeping the year-on-year gain in wages at 2.5 percent for a fifth consecutive month.</p> \n\n<p>Sluggish wage growth would come on the heels of a report on Thursday showing the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months to July - the smallest rise in just over 1-1/2 years.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>\"The job market is in very good shape, but wage growth is very disappointing and that's likely to continue for over the next several months,\" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. \"Whether or not the Fed moves in December will be contingent on inflation.\"</p> \n\n<p>U.S. financial markets are pricing in a roughly 36 percent probability of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting according to CME Group's FedWatch program.

So let me say on the record, any ad which quotes what I said on Sunday is a falsehood, because I have publicly said those words were inaccurate and unfortunate.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>A grateful nation thanks you, Newt Gingrich. The presidential campaign is just starting, and already you&#8217;ve given us a passage that will live in infamy &#8212; forever &#8212; in the annals of American political speech. Your delightful quotation shall be filed under &#8220;fiascos&#8221; and flagged with a cross-reference to &#8220;utter nonsense.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>I can&#8217;t remember when we&#8217;ve heard a politician plead so desperately to take back something he said. Then again, naked desperation is clearly in order. The favorite parlor game in Washington this week has been trying to remember a more disastrous campaign launch than the one Gingrich is having. Many candidates have stumbled coming out of the gate, but few have taken off like a shot in the wrong direction.</p> \n\n<p>The great irony, of course, is that Gingrich&#8217;s grievous error was to speak the truth. Appearing on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; last Sunday, he referred to the proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to convert Medicare into a voucher program &#8212; endorsed by all but four members of the GOP majority in the House &#8212; as &#8220;right-wing social engineering.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>He went on, &#8220;I think that that is too big a jump. I think that what you want to have is a system where people voluntarily migrate to better outcomes, better solutions, better options.&#8221; He said he considered President Obama&#8217;s health care reform law to be &#8220;radical change&#8221; and added that &#8220;I would be against a conservative imposing radical change.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Prominent Republicans immediately grabbed their pitchforks, lit their torches and formed an angry mob. From opinion surveys and town-hall meetings, it was already clear that the Ryan plan to fundamentally alter the Medicare program is deeply unpopular &#8212; and that ultimately it is likely to hurt the party at the polls. Now one of the best-known figures in the party, a candidate for the presidential nomination, was breaking ranks. Rather than accept the fact that Gingrich is right &#8212; or was right, since he now wants us to forget he ever appeared on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; &#8212; Republicans mau-maued him into a full-throated disavowal.</p> \n\n<p>First he tried to claim that host David Gregory had somehow bamboozled him with a trick question; this &#8220;babe in the woods&#8221; defense was laughable, given that Gingrich had been on the show 34 times before Sunday&#8217;s self-immolation. Then he claimed he actually supported the Ryan plan but believed the groundwork, in terms of public opinion, hadn&#8217;t been properly laid. Finally, he just gave up and demanded to take it all back.</p> \n\n<p>But by then, video was already circulating of an encounter Gingrich had with an Iowa voter who told him that &#8220;what you just did to Paul Ryan is unforgivable.&#8221; When Gingrich mildly protested, the man persisted: &#8220;Yes, you did. You undercut him and his allies in the House. You&#8217;re an embarrassment to our party. &#8230; Why don&#8217;t you get out before you make a bigger fool of yourself?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Gingrich&#8217;s week just couldn&#8217;t get any worse. But then it did.</p> \n\n<p>While he and his wife Callista were at a book signing in Minnesota on Tuesday, a gay-rights activist showered the candidate with colorful glitter. That same day, it was reported that Callista Gingrich, in disclosure reports she was required to file when she worked for the House Agriculture Committee, stated that at one point the couple owed between $250,000 and $500,000 to Tiffany&#8217;s. So much for understanding the struggles of everyday Americans.</p> \n\n<p>To cap it all off, Gingrich&#8217;s press secretary, Rick Tyler, was asked by the Huffington Post to comment on media coverage of his candidate. Tyler&#8217;s response suggests that the next time he sends someone out for coffee, he might ask for decaf. &#8220;The literati sent out their minions to do their bidding,&#8221; it begins, before going on to describe an epic &#8220;firefight&#8221; that somehow involves sheep, cocktail parties and bylines.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;A lesser person could not have survived the first few minutes of the onslaught,&#8221; Tyler wrote. &#8220;But out of the billowing smoke and dust of tweets and trivia emerged Gingrich, once again ready to lead those who won&#8217;t be intimidated by the political elite.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>I must note that Gingrich, a former House speaker, has been a card-carrying member of the political elite for years.

investments such as private highways) but is now Obama&#8217;s Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economic Affairs.&amp;#160; If Froman is otherwise engaged, Hormats can interface with Froman&#8217;s deputy, David Lipton, who was until recently running Citi&#8217;s global country risk management effort.</p> \n\n<p>Citigroup is also well represented at Treasury, in the form of Lewis Alexander, formerly the bank&#8217;s chief economist and now Counselor to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.&amp;#160; Given the role played by all of the above in bankrupting us all, Alexander&#8217;s 2007 verdict on the onset of the mortgage crash, &#8220;I think that&#8217;s not going to spill more broadly into the economy and so I think we&#8217;re going to have a normal kind of housing cycle though the middle of this year,&#8221; can only have been a recommendation in the eyes of his current employer.</p> \n\n<p>Alexander&#8217;s function at Citi may have been merely to endorse the financial depredations of colleagues with economic blather, rather than exercise loss-making functions personally.&amp;#160; Not so Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin, who has moved over to the number two job at the department from the Hartford Insurance Company, where he served as president and chief operating officer of the Property and Casualty Group.&amp;#160; Hartford was one of the insurance companies that got suckered by the banks into backing their ruinous investments in real estate and other esoterica, but Wolin&#8217;s Treasury has just handed Hartford $3.4 billion of our money in the form of TARP funds.</p> \n\n<p>Hormats&#8217; agricultural responsibilities will of necessity bring him into frequent contact with the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Gary Gensler &#8211;&amp;#160; a former Goldman partner.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; As Assistant Secretary of Treasury in the Clinton Adminsitration Gensler played a key role in greasing the skids for the notorious Commodity Futures Modernization Act of&amp;#160; 2000, which set the stage for the great credit default swaps scam that underpinned the recent bubble and subsequent collapse.&amp;#160; News of the appointment did generate threats of obstruction in the Senate &#8211; any one of&amp;#160; the senators could have blocked the appointment had they really wished to do so &#8211; but such threats proved predictably hollow.&amp;#160; Had they been otherwise, Treasury Chief of Staff Mark Patterson could of course have lent the expertise he gained as Goldman&#8217;s lobbyist to overcome the obstacle.</p> \n\n<p>For sheer gall it would be hard to equal the appointment of&amp;#160; Gensler, one of the engineers of this catastrophe, but the administration has managed it with the selection of Linda Robertson, formerly a key Enron lobbyist and intimately involved in pushing through the commodity futures act as chief flack&amp;#160; for the Federal Reserve.&amp;#160; Prior to joining the crooked energy-trading firm, Robertson was an important figure in the Clinton Treasury Department, latterly serving her friend Larry Summers and before him Robert Rubin during their terms as Treasury Secretaries.</p> \n\n<p>Such connection to the key enablers of our bankrupt casino helps explain many of the other hires listed above.&amp;#160; Michael Froman was Chief of Staff to Robert Rubin at Treasury before following Rubin to his reward at Citigroup.&amp;#160; Most significantly, it was Froman who first introduced Rubin to his Harvard classmate Barack Obama.&amp;#160; David Lipton also served in the Rubin Treasury, as deputy under secretary for international affairs.&amp;#160; Neal Wolin, on the other hand, appears to have more an acolyte of Summers, who cherished him as Treasury General Counsel from &#8217;99 to &#8217;01.&amp;#160; Summers and Robertson were similarly close, and certainly he raised no objection to her fatal submissions on behalf of her paymasters at Enron.</p> \n\n<p>Recent reports suggest that financial industry lobbying in Washington, at $104.7 million for the first three months of 2009, is 8% down on last year.&amp;#160; But that is to be expected &#8211; why should Wall Street continue paying&amp;#160; top dollar for a wholly owned subsidiary?</p> \n\n<p>ANDREW COCKBURN writes about national security and related matters.

She even had a signature phrase &#8212; &#8220;dahling,&#8221; in her florid Hungarian accent.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Zsa Zsa is unique. She&#8217;s a woman from the court of Louis XV who has somehow managed to live in the 20th century, undamaged by the PTA,&#8221; wrote author Gerald Frank, who helped Miss Gabor with her 1960 autobiography.</p> \n\n<p>She had nine husbands, but was still with Mr. von Anhalt more than 30 years after they were married.</p> \n\n<p>Ever the saucy personality, when Miss Gabor was asked &#8220;How many husbands have you had?&#8221; she replied, &#8220;You mean other than my own?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>As for the impact of the 1960s and feminism on much-married socialites, she replied: &#8220;The women&#8217;s movement hasn&#8217;t changed my sex life. It wouldn&#8217;t dare.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In her second autobiography, 1993&#8217;s &#8220;One Lifetime is Not Enough,&#8221; she claimed that her first sexual encounter was in 1932 with Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, when she was 15.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;For the rest of my life, I would search for another god to eclipse him,&#8221; Miss Gabor wrote.</p> \n\n<p>She had one daughter, Constance Francesca Hilton, born 1947 when she was married to hotelier Conrad Hilton, making Miss Gabor technically a distant relative to Paris Hilton.</p> \n\n<p>One of her splashiest tabloid appearance grew out of a 1989 traffic stop in which she slapped the face of a Beverly Hills policeman who stopped her Rolls-Royce on a traffic violation. Miss Gabor gleefully attacked the policeman&#8217;s character on TV afterward. Besides the assault on a lawman, she was convicted of driving without a license and an open-container violation.</p> \n\n<p>She was sentenced to three days in jail and community service, but refused to perform the latter and so served three more days in jail.</p> \n\n<p>And in a gesture that typified her insouciance, Miss Gabor made a joke of the whole thing for the opening credits of the 1991 cop-show-parody movie &#8220;The Naked Gun 2&#189;.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>After the siren that had been making its way through a whole series of impossibly surreal events pulls over a Rolls-Royce, Miss Gabor gets out of the car and slaps the siren, saying &#8220;this happens every f&#8211;ing time when I go shopping.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>After a 2002 auto accident in which Miss Gabor (a passenger) suffered partial paralysis, Miss Gabor basically retired from the public eye. Since then, she suffered multiple strokes, had part of her leg amputated, required a feeding tube, had a hip replacement and couldn&#8217;t even attend her birthday parties.</p> \n\n<p>Her husband reportedly even <a href=\"https://dailynewshungary.com/zsa-zsa-gabor-i-want-to-die-in-hungary/\" type=\"external\">kept from her</a> the news of daughter&#8217;s Francesca&#8217;s 2015 death from her, from fear she couldn&#8217;t handle it.

(photo: Toru Yamanaka/AFP/Getty)</p> \n\n<p>The Washington Post decided to correct the positive image of Denmark that Sen. Bernie Sanders and others have been giving it in recent months. It ran a piece <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/03/why-denmark-isnt-the-utopian-fantasy-bernie-sanders-describes/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_wb-denmark-330pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory\" type=\"external\">telling readers</a>:</p> \n\n<p>Why Denmark Isn&#8217;t the Utopian Fantasy Bernie Sanders Describes</p> \n\n<p>The piece is centered on an interview with Michael Booth, a food and travel writer who has spent a considerable period of time in the Scandinavian countries.</p> \n\n<p>Much of the piece is focused on the alleged economic problems of Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries. At one point the interviewer, Ana Swanson, asks:</p> \n\n<p>Danes are experiencing a rising debt level, and a lower proportion of people working. Are these worrying signs for its economy or the country&#8217;s model?</p> \n\n<p>While Denmark&#8217;s employment rate has been declining, it is still far higher than the employment rate in the United States. The employment rate for prime age workers (ages 25&#8211;54) is still more than 5 full percentage points higher than in the United States. If the rate of decline since the 2001 peak continues, it will fall below the current US level in roughly 24 years. (The US rate also fell over this period.) If we take the broader 16&#8211;64 age group, then the <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=LFS_SEXAGE_I_R\" type=\"external\">gap falls slightly</a>, to 4.7 percentage points.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\" /></p> \n\n<p>As far as having an unsustainable debt level, Swanson seems somewhat confused. According to <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=43&amp;amp;pr.y=7&amp;amp;sy=2010&amp;amp;ey=2020&amp;amp;scsm=1&amp;amp;ssd=1&amp;amp;sort=country&amp;amp;ds=.&amp;amp;br=1&amp;amp;c=128%2C142%2C144%2C111&amp;amp;s=GGXCNL_NGDP%2CGGXWDN_NGDP%2CBCA_NGDPD&amp;amp;grp=0&amp;amp;a=\" type=\"external\">the IMF</a>, Denmark&#8217;s net debt-to-GDP ratio will be 6.3 percent at the end of this year. Sweden has a negative net debt, meaning the government owns more financial assets than the amount of debt it has outstanding. In Norway&#8217;s case, because of its huge oil assets, the proceeds of which it has largely saved, the government wealth-to-GDP ratio is almost 270 percent. This would be equivalent to having a public investment fund of more than $40 trillion in the United States.</p> \n\n<p>Some of the other assertions in the piece are either misleading or inaccurate. For example, Booth is quoted as saying:</p> \n\n<p>Meanwhile, though it is true that these are the most gender-equal societies in the world, they also record the highest rates of violence towards women&amp;#160;&#8212; only part of which can be explained by high levels of reporting of crime.</p> \n\n<p>Actually, Danish women are far less likely to be murdered by their husbands or boyfriends than women in the United States. Its <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/data.html\" type=\"external\">murder rate</a> is 0.8 per 100,000, compared to 4.7 per 100,000 in the United States.</p> \n\n<p>Later Booth is quoted as saying:</p> \n\n<p>In Denmark, the quality of the free&amp;#160;education and healthcare is substandard: They are way down on the PISA [ <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/pisa/\" type=\"external\">Programme for International Student Assessment</a>] educational rankings, have the lowest life expectancy in the region, and the highest rates of death from cancer. And there is broad consensus that the economic model of a public sector and welfare state on this scale is unsustainable.</p> \n\n<p>While Denmark is not among the leaders on either PISA scores or <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?order=wbapi_data_value_2013+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;amp;sort=desc\" type=\"external\">life expectancy</a>, on both measures it is well ahead of the United States. And the &#8220;broad consensus that the economic model&#8230;is unsustainable&#8221; exists only in Booth&#8217;s head.</p> \n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/ctp/tax-policy/taxing-wages-tax-burden-trends-latest-year.htm\" type=\"external\">OECD figures</a>, labor is taxed more heavily in several non-Scandinavian countries, including Belgium, Austria, Germany, Hungary, France and Italy.</p> \n\n<p>Booth is also apparently confused about tax rates around the world. He tells readers:</p> \n\n<p>Denmark has the highest direct and indirect taxes in the world, and you don&#8217;t need to be a high earner to make it into the top tax bracket of 56 percent (to which you must add 25 percent value-added tax, the highest energy taxes in the world, car import duty of 180 percent, and so on).</p> \n\n<p>Actually, France has a top marginal tax rate of 75 percent. The U.S. rate was 90 percent during the Eisenhower administration.</p> \n\n<p>Booth apparently is confused about Denmark&#8217;s public spending. He tells readers: &#8220;How the money is spent is kept deliberately opaque by the authorities.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Actually, it is not difficult to find a great deal of information about how Denmark&#8217;s money is spent. Much of it can be gotten from the <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SNA_TABLE11\" type=\"external\">OECD&#8217;s website</a>.</p> \n\n<p>So we get that Mr. Booth doesn&#8217;t like Denmark. He tells readers that the food and weather are awful. That may be true, but his analysis of other aspects of Danish society doesn&#8217;t fit with the data.</p> \n\n<p>Economist Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC.

After more than a decade of drama, Trump&#8217;s name is being stripped from a 65-story hotel and condo building in downtown Toronto, following years of financial failure and lawsuits. In the end, the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Toronto has become yet another symbol of the flaws of the Trump business empire: construction setbacks, strange financing, angry investors, and empty hotel rooms.</p> \n\n<p>Trump first made his move into Canada at the height of his&amp;#160;Apprentice deal-making fame, inking an agreement&amp;#160;to attach his name&#8212;and reputation&#8212;to a shiny new Toronto tower, in which he had no ownership interest. When the building&amp;#160;opened five years ago, Trump kicked off the project with a bit of promotion that looks a lot like the PR strategy he would employ as a candidate and as president: a&amp;#160;tweet with a dramatic video of his plane landing and a black motorcade of SUVs rolling into the hotel&#8217;s entrance, where an adoring crowd waited.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>In the 2012&amp;#160;video&#8212;after a montage of the future commander-in-chief examining bathrooms and piles of merchandise set to jazzy trumpet music&#8212;Trump took the podium and declared, &#8220;About eight years ago I began this voyage, and it turned out to be a beautiful voyage, because the end result is this spectacular building.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The beautiful voyage did not last. The Toronto tower he leased his name to never lived up to the hype. On Tuesday morning, the Trump Organization and the building&#8217;s current owner announced that the president&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-27/trump-hotel-owner-in-toronto-reaches-deal-to-remove-trump-brand\" type=\"external\">name will be removed from the hotel</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Trump spent years promoting the property as a total success and an extension of his brand. His original partners in the project were two Russian-Canadian businessmen, neither of whom had any experience with building a skyscraper. As the building went up, construction delays and other problems&#8212;including <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/glass-falls-from-trump-tower/article5306888/\" type=\"external\">pieces of the building falling off&#8212;</a>set the project back.</p> \n\n<p>The building was to be financed through a scheme&#8212;used in other Trump projects, such as the Trump Soho in New York City&#8212;in which investors bought individual units and signed an agreement allowing them to be rented out through the Trump-managed hotel. In return for providing money upfront for the construction, these owners would enjoy a slice of the profits when their rooms were filled by hotel customers.</p> \n\n<p>Trump agreed to manage the hotel once the building was complete, but <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/02/08/513946283/trump-tower-in-toronto-is-up-for-sale-and-facing-legal-woes\" type=\"external\">lawsuits from investors</a> charged that Trump and his partners had misled them&amp;#160;about his role in the building.</p> \n\n<p>These investor lawsuits were not unique to Trump&#8217;s Toronto deal. He battled similar actions in relation to&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/us/politics/donald-trump-soho-settlement.html?_r=0\" type=\"external\">Trump Soho</a>&amp;#160;and other properties. In these cases, investors complained that they had been misled by the promotional material and sales teams that&amp;#160;pitched the deals as successful Trump-led projects. (Trump <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/05/23/trump-lawsuit-chicago/2355929/\" type=\"external\">prevailed</a> in one such high-profile case in 2013.)</p> \n\n<p>The majority of the Toronto building&#8217;s units remained unsold. (Some investors who had bought units prior to construction later backed out after the 2008 economic crisis.) Trump&#8217;s partners then turned to another source of financing. One of those partners, Alexander Shnaider, owned a stake in a Ukrainian steel mill; he sold it in 2010 and used some of the estimated $850 million in proceeds to prop up the Trump Toronto project. The buyer at the other end of the Ukrainian steel mill deal? A Russian state-owned bank known to have close ties to Vladimir Putin and now on the list of financial institutions under sanction by the US government. (In May, the Wall Street Journal&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-state-run-bank-financed-deal-involving-trump-hotel-partner-1495031708\" type=\"external\">reported</a>&amp;#160;that this deal has become a subject of interest for US investigators probing Trump&#8217;s potential connections with Russia.)</p> \n\n<p>The extra financing, though, wasn&#8217;t enough, and the building remained troubled. This past November, shortly after the US election, Trump&#8217;s Canadian partners <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-26/trump-hotel-in-toronto-nears-auction-after-default-by-developer\" type=\"external\">lost control of the building</a>. It was the new owner, JCF Capital, that&amp;#160;announced Tuesday&amp;#160;that it was cutting ties with the Trump Organization. Given the building&#8217;s checkered history and the hotel&#8217;s struggle to succeed under Trump management, such a move made sense. Since Trump&#8217;s election, protesters in Toronto have homed&amp;#160;in on the property as the target of their ire. Recent searches of hotel booking websites show rooms there being offered at steep discounts.</p> \n\n<p>According to Bloomberg, JCF Capital <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-27/trump-hotel-owner-in-toronto-reaches-deal-to-remove-trump-brand\" type=\"external\">may have paid as much as $6 million</a> to ditch the Trump name. But Trump will lose a valuable revenue stream. According to the three personal financial disclosures he has filed since first announcing his candidacy, Trump has earned more than half a million dollars per year for the last three years in management fees, though he reported that&amp;#160;his fees had fallen&amp;#160;in the past year. (Trump&#8217;s adult sons have assumed daily control of the Trump Organization, but Trump still retains near complete ownership of the business and almost all its assets.)</p> \n\n<p>The collapse of the Toronto business is the latest in a series of hits to Trump&#8217;s high-end luxury hotel empire. Questions have been raised by former employees <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-21/trump-russia-and-those-shadowy-sater-deals-at-bayrock\" type=\"external\">about the source of financing of the&amp;#160;</a>the Trump Soho, which Trump once owned&amp;#160;a stake in but now only manages.&amp;#160;Recently, that hotel reportedly <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/24/new-yorks-trump-soho-hotel-is-reportedly-planning-to-lay-off-staff.html\" type=\"external\">laid off staff</a> and shuttered a high-end restaurant following a post-election slump in business. A new Trump-managed golf course in New York City <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/nyregion/trump-golf-course-bronx.html\" type=\"external\">has had its business decline in the past year</a>, and several other Trump properties, including his beloved Mar-a-Lago,&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-banquet-business-was-booming-at-mar-a-lago-then-trump-became-president/2017/06/23/1f50cf28-5145-11e7-b064-828ba60fbb98_story.html\" type=\"external\">have suffered as well</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Last week,&amp;#160;Mother Jones <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">reported</a> that Trump condo sales seem to be slumping, with large cuts in the listing prices for several prominent Trump-owned units in New York City.

More value-oriented investors might want to seek out more overlooked and undervalued companies with exposure to the driverless market.</p> \n\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/10/01/2-incredibly-cheap-driverless-car-stocks.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">previous article Opens a New Window.</a>, I highlighted NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ: NXPI) and Delphi Automotive as undervalued plays on driverless cars. Today, I'll focus on two other players with attractive valuations -- Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU).</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Qualcomm, the world's biggest mobile chipmaker, will likely acquireNXP Semiconductors, the world's top automotive chipmaker, for over $37 billion in the near future. Once that <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/10/04/should-qualcomm-inc-pay-30-billion-for-nxp-semicon.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">deal closes Opens a New Window.</a>, Qualcomm will become the 800-pound gorilla in the automotive chips market.</p> \n\n<p>Over the past few years, Qualcomm has gradually lost market share in mobile devices to cheaper rivals like MediaTek and first-party chips from major OEMs like Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. To offset those losses, Qualcomm <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/08/11/qualcomm-inc-is-running-out-of-room-to-grow-whats.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">aggressively expanded Opens a New Window.</a>into Internet of Things (IoT) devices, drones, connected cameras, and connected cars.</p> \n\n<p>Prior to the NXP deal, Qualcomm acquired IoT and automotive chipmaker CSR for $2.4 billion last year, and launched a line of Snapdragon Automotive chips forinfotainment and navigation systems. Buying NXP (which expanded its automotive business by buying Freescale last year) will add a wide variety of automotive chips, along with the turnkey driverless platform BlueBox, to Qualcomm's portfolio.</p> \n\n<p>The exact impact of the merger will be hard to gauge until the deal is formally announced, but Qualcomm currently trades at fairly low multiples. Despite rallying 35% this year, Qualcomm still trades at 20 times earnings -- which is lower than the average P/E of 22 for broad line semiconductor companies.</p> \n\n<p>Baidu, the top search engine in China, announced inJune that it would put driverless cars on public roads within the next five years. Like its American counterpart, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, Baidu doesn't plan to mass produce the cars by itself. Instead, it plans to outsource the production to existing automakers, with the first Baidu-branded vehicle set to arrive in 2018. That vehicle will be a driverless shuttle bus programmed to run in a loop.</p> \n\n<p>Last December, Baidu started testing out its driverless technology on a fleet of BMW 3-Series GTs in Beijing and Wuhu. Earlier this year, Baidu established a driverless tech research center in Silicon Valley, with the goal of testing out autonomous cars in the U.S. in the near future.</p> \n\n<p>BMW 3-Series GT. Image source: BMW.</p> \n\n<p>Baidu's growing interest in driverless cars comes at a time when Chinese tech companies are battling over online-to-offline (O2O) services (like hailing cabs, ordering movie tickets, making dinner reservations) instead of simple online searches. As ride-hailing apps and driverless cars both grow in popularity, they will likely converge with apps for hailing autonomous taxis.</p> \n\n<p>When that happens, Baidu's expansive ecosystem of search, maps, mobile payments, and O2O services could help it dominate the market by leveraging its users' dependence on those core services. While that ambitious goal might take years to reach, Baidu remains fairly cheap at 13 times earnings -- which is much lower than the industry average of P/E of 50 for internet information providers.</p> \n\n<p>Qualcomm and Baidu still trade at relatively low multiples because many investors are worried about their near-term headwinds. Qualcomm still faces tough competition in smartphone chips, and its higher-margin licensing business remains under pressure from defiant OEMs and government regulators. Baidu's margins have declined over the past few years due to its increased spending on new markets like O2O services and driverless cars.</p> \n\n<p>Investors are wise to question Qualcomm and Baidu's ability to clear those big hurdles, but they should also note that both companies are well-poised to capitalize on the growth of driverless cars. Moreover, their fairly low valuations indicate that they might have more upside growth potential than more richly valued driverless stocks like <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/05/22/better-driverless-car-stock-mobileye-nv-or-nvidi-2.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Nvidia and Mobileye Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Watters has admitted his infidelity which he only reported to Fox News human resources after the divorce papers were filed. He and his now-estranged wife have twin six year old daughters.</p> \n\n<p>Most companies have strict prohibitions against employees engaging in romantic relationships with subordinates on their staff. Generally it mandates termination of the superior employee who is in a position to abuse their power. Presumably, Fox News has the same policy. However, the response by Fox upon discovery of the relationship was to transfer DiGiovine to another program and let Watters off the hook entirely. Now he can continue leading classy discussions wherein he describes single women as &#8220;Beyonc&#233; voters&#8221; who &#8220;depend on government because they&#8217;re not depending on their husbands. They need things like contraception, health care and they love to talk about equal pay.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>This is just the latest sex scandal at Fox News. Previously their founder and CEO, the late Roger Ailes was fired after multiple allegations of sexual harassment and abuse. Then their star host, Bill O&#8217;Reilly, got the ax when it became publicly known that he had paid millions of dollars in settlements to silence his accusers. Gee, Doanld Trump only paid $130,000 (that we know of). Fox and Friends anchor Ed Henry was suspended for several weeks for having an adulterous affair. Fox business host Charles Payne was also the subject of harassment charges. And Watters got his seat on The Five by replacing Eric Bolling, who was fired for sending explicit photos to women colleagues at Fox.</p> \n\n<p>How Fox News Deceives and Controls Their Flock: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QSSMOES/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00QSSMOES&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=newscorpsecom-20&amp;amp;linkId=TLI6JC2OYE22MUTS\" type=\"external\">Fox Nation vs. Reality: The Fox News Cult of Ignorance.</a> Available now at Amazon.</p> \n\n<p>This obviously isn&#8217;t a case of a few bad apples.

Diallo alleged that Strauss-Kahn forced her to perform oral sex on May 14, 2011, in his suite at the Manhattan Sofitel. The criminal prosecution fell apart after doubts emerged concerning Diallo's credibility as a witness and the attempted rape charges against Strauss-Kahn were eventually dropped.</p> \n\n<p>Strauss-Kahn has maintained that the sexual encounter was consensual, although he admitted in a TV interview after his return to France that he regretted his ``moral error''.

He also knows that his opponents in the west, most notably in the United States, know that fact better than most.</p> \n\n<p>Notes.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\" type=\"external\">[1]</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/904309527381716992</a></p> \n\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\" type=\"external\">[2]</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/02/trump-plans-withdrawal-from-south-korea-trade-deal/</a></p> \n\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\" type=\"external\">[3]</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">http://thehill.com/policy/defense/349081-mattis-on-north-korea-we-are-not-looking-for-the-annihilation-of-north-korea</a></p> \n\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref4\" type=\"external\">[4]</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/904377075049656322</a></p> \n\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref5\" type=\"external\">[5]</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/904307898213433344</a></p> \n\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref6\" type=\"external\">[6]</a> <a href=\"https://www.fiveaa.com.au/content/pm-calls-urgent-un-action-n-korea\" type=\"external\">https://www.fiveaa.com.au/content/pm-calls-urgent-un-action-n-korea</a></p>", "title": "Unnerving the Donald: North Korea\u2019s Sixth Nuclear Test", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2017/09/04/unnerving-the-donald-north-koreas-sixth-nuclear-test/", "published_at": "2017-09-04", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Chris Matthews, host of MSNBC's Hardball, displayed some faux modesty Monday night when <a href=\"http://www.freedomworks.org/matt-kibbe\" type=\"external\">Freedomworks CEO Matt Kibbe</a> suggested the recent drop in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=0CDgQFjAC&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpoliticalticker.blogs.cnn.com%2F2013%2F10%2F16%2Fpoll-tea-partys-favorable-numbers-take-a-hit%2F&amp;amp;ei=r_VlUpv_EujSiALo5YD4Cg&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEYVQFc-mKwQ7f4FzkVh5ja4EOsTg&amp;amp;bvm=bv.55123115,d.cGE\" type=\"external\">Tea Party opinion polls</a> just may have resulted from the excessive bias permeating throughout MSNBC and the mainstream media itself.

It can be difficult to never sell, especially when times seem dire -- but if you can pick companies with durable competitive advantages, you should be able to sleep at night and avoid pressing the panic \"sell\" button.</p> \n\n<p>Here are four Motley Fool contributors with companies that they recommend never selling: International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), Allergan (NYSE: AGN), Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), and Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA).</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFBargainBin/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Tim Green Opens a New Window.</a>: Every stock that I buy I intend to hold for years. Ideally, a stock will produce exceptional returns indefinitely, never requiring me to sell. Things change, of course, and investors can't be afraid to sell a stock if their thesis has been turned upside down. But in general, the longer the holding period, the better.</p> \n\n<p>Predicting how technology will evolve is hard, if not impossible, and that makes committing to holding a technology stock indefinitely risky. But International Business Machines, a company that has been around for a century, is one tech stock that I'm comfortable holding for a long time. The company has transformed itself on multiple occasions during its lifetime, shifting from mechanical tabulating machines to computers, then transitioning into a software and services company, and now throwing its weight behind cloud and cognitive computing.</p> \n\n<p>Transitions are always painful, and the current one IBM is undergoing is no exception. Revenue has been declining for years, and earnings are being pressured as the company shifts resources from legacy businesses to areas that offer the most potential. There's no guarantee that IBM will succeed, but if I'm going to be holding a tech stock for a very long time, a company with a long history of adaptation makes the most sense.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFGBudwell/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">George Budwell Opens a New Window.</a>: There aren't many stocks I would absolutely never sell, but specialty pharma Allergan is an exception to the rule. The short story is that Allergan is currently in the process of shedding its generic-drug business to focus on branded products like the double-chin treatment Kybella, and the IBS drugs Linzess and Viberzi, among many others. As a result, the health of the drugmaker's balance sheet has improved dramatically in the last few months, with the company already retiring $9 billion in debt this year. And Allergan's recent double-digit top-line growth appears to be sustainable for the long haul, given that the drugmaker is in the midst of multiple new product launches at the moment.</p> \n\n<p>Having said that, Allergan's penchant for wheeling and dealing is an area of concern. So far, management has carefully guided the company through multiple acquisitions that have led to an overall healthier enterprise. However, one bad deal in the pharmaceutical industry can hamper a company's growth for a decade or more. That's why I would personally prefer for Allergan to pay off even more debt, and perhaps sit tight for the time being, instead of rushing out to spend its recent windfall from the sale of its generic unit. But this is Allergan, after all, meaning that a monstrous acquisition is almost certainly coming down the pike soon. So, hopefully, management can continue their winning ways by adding yet another value-creating asset to the company's already strong product portfolio of branded medicines. Stay tuned.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFmd19/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Matt DiLallo Opens a New Window.</a>: Midstream pipeline giant Enterprise Products Partners has been a part of my portfolio since 2007. I plan on keeping it right where it is, and adding to my position over time, because I view it as an anchor income holding. It is a decision that paid off very well in the past, and one that I expect will continue for many years to come.</p> \n\n<p>What drew me toward Enterprise Products Partners was its eye-popping yield, which at the time of <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/08/27/the-secret-to-buying-high-yield-stocks.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">my initial investment Opens a New Window.</a> was just shy of 7%. However, since my first purchase, the distribution has gone up every single quarter. Because of that, the yield on my initial investment is now more than 11.5%.</p> \n\n<p>Three factors drive Enterprise's ability to grow the payout. First, it primarily owns fee-based assets that are under long-term contracts, so it generates rather stable cash flow. Second, unlike most master limited partnerships, it does not distribute all of its cash flow back to investors; instead, it retains a substantial portion to reinvest into growth projects, including $5.3 billion since 2011. Finally, the company continues to construct a steady stream of fee-based assets that drive cash-flow growth; currently, it has $5.6 billion of projects under construction to drive growth through 2018.</p> \n\n<p>With a solid foundation and ample running room for future growth, Enterprise Products Partners is one company that I have no desire to sell.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFTwoCoins/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Daniel Miller Opens a New Window.</a>: Investors hopping off the Boeing Co. bandwagon could be forgiven, especially after a rough second quarter, when the aviation juggernaut took almost $3 billion in pre-tax charges from its 787, 747 and KC-46 tanker programs. However, despite the rough quarter, Boeing still has durable comparable advantages with its commercial and defense businesses, which make it a stock you shouldn't sell.</p> \n\n<p>Boeing operates in an intensely regulated commercial aircraft industry, so it's extremely difficult for new competitors to enter the market, leaving Boeing and Airbus to dominate the area. There are very real barriers to entry imposed by the knowledge and experience required to develop, design, assemble and certify commercial aircraft; that isn't changing any time soon, which is great news for investors willing to stick around for the long haul.</p> \n\n<p>Another bonus is that over the past five years, Boeing has increasingly focused on returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as you can see below:</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://ycharts.com/companies/BA/shares_outstanding\" type=\"external\">BA Shares Outstanding</a> data by <a href=\"http://ycharts.com\" type=\"external\">YCharts Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>And despite being in a cyclical industry, Boeing has more than $470 billion worth of orders in its combined commercial and defense backlog, which is roughly five years' worth of revenue transparency. On top of that, Boeing made the decision to incrementally improve both the 737 and 777 programs, rather than develop all-new aircraft, which should generate more cash flow and increase its return on invested capital.</p> \n\n<p>The downside with Boeing is that the company operates in a cyclical industry, which guarantees turbulence at some point, and when operational mistakes happen they cost a pretty penny see Boeing's second quarter. But any company that operates in an industry with steep barriers to entry and has a history of returning value to shareholders is a company you shouldn't sell anytime soon.</p> \n\n<p>A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

But contradictions from Trump are a dime a dozen.</p> \n\n<p>A closer examination shows a deeper pattern of remarkable consistency in U.S. policy toward Syria that is far more critical than the perennial contradictions of politicians like Trump.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>To summarize U.S. actions and non-actions in terms of direct publicly announced U.S. air attacks targeting the Syrian regime: In 2013, when Assad was losing the war, Obama refrained from strikes that may well have ended his regime. Now, four years later, when Assad seems close to winning the war, Trump with a revamped NSC does a 180 on his previous pronouncements and attacks Assad.</p> \n\n<p>Push away the personalities. Dispense with the rhetoric. Free yourself from the spin cycle that much of the media obsess over. Just follow the policy.</p> \n\n<p>The evidence is that the underlying U.S. policy &#8212; whether the president is Obama or Trump &#8212; is to prolong the Syrian war as much as possible. Let Assad off the hook when he&#8217;s cornered, hit him when he&#8217;s about to win.</p> \n\n<p>This would not at all be unprecedented. Through the 1980s, the U.S. backed both sides in the Iran-Iraq War, which resulted in horrific carnage. See Dahlia Wasfi&#8217;s piece from 2015 &#8212; &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/battling-isis-iran-iraq-war-redux-1538117706\" type=\"external\">Battling ISIS: Iran-Iraq war redux</a>&#8221; &#8212; which argued that &#8220;Obama&#8217;s unofficial strategy to fight ISIS may be that of Reagan&#8217;s for Iran and Iraq in the 1980s: a long, drawn-out war to strengthen U.S.-Israeli hegemony in the region.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Since the Arab uprisings of 2011, we&#8217;ve seen a series of actions by the U.S. government and its allies and clients &#8212; from Israel and Saudi Arabia in particular &#8212; to ensure the destruction of secular, at times independent Arab governments.</p> \n\n<p>Many obsess over &#8220;double standards&#8221; and apparent contradictions by Trump, Obama, Clinton and other political figures. But much of this analysis presumes that these political figures have stated what their actual goals are.</p> \n\n<p>But a president can&#8217;t come forward and publicly say that the goal is the continuation of the war in Syria. That would be to embrace the carnage and suffering that the policy causes. The president can&#8217;t just say we&#8217;re in cahoots with the authoritarian Israeli and Saudi regimes to keep countries like Iraq, Syria and Libya in turmoil.</p> \n\n<p>So, politicians claim they are acting to save human life or to stop weapons proliferation or whatever their pretext is. Then, because it&#8217;s not their actual reasons, people see what seem like contractions: &#8220;They don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing!&#8221; &#8220;He&#8217;s such an idiot!&#8221; But they are not really contradictions, they just highlight that the stated goals are not the actual goals.</p> \n\n<p>Except at times. Trump did say <a href=\"http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2015/09/16/cnn-reagan-library-debate-later-debate-full-transcript/\" type=\"external\">in a high profile debate</a> in September, 2015: &#8220;ISIS wants to fight Syria. Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>And this gruesome notion is occasionally brought up in the establishment media in more polite terms. In 2013, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/world/middleeast/israel-backs-limited-strike-against-syria.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0\" type=\"external\">the New York Times reported on</a> how Israel viewed the prospect of Obama bombing Assad&#8217;s forces:</p> \n\n<p>Israelis have increasingly argued that the best outcome for Syria&#8217;s two-and-a-half-year-old civil war, at least for the moment, is no outcome.</p> \n\n<p>[For the Israeli government], the status quo, horrific as it may be from a humanitarian perspective, seems preferable to either a victory by Mr. Assad&#8217;s government and his Iranian backers or a strengthening of rebel groups, increasingly dominated by Sunni jihadis.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;This is a playoff situation in which you need both teams to lose, but at least you don&#8217;t want one to win &#8212; we&#8217;ll settle for a tie,&#8221; said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul general in New York. &#8220;Let them both bleed, hemorrhage to death: that&#8217;s the strategic thinking here. As long as this lingers, there&#8217;s no real threat from Syria.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The synergy between the Israeli and American positions, while not explicitly articulated by the leaders of either country, could be a critical source of support as Mr. Obama seeks Congressional approval for surgical strikes in Syria.</p> \n\n<p>This notion <a href=\"http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/syriasource/syria-the-imperative-of-protecting-civilians\" type=\"external\">comes up</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/world/middleeast/obamas-uncertain-path-amid-syria-bloodshed.html\" type=\"external\">occasionally</a>.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s often claimed that &#8220;regime change&#8221; is the goal of the U.S., including by <a href=\"https://husseini.posthaven.com/crosstalk-lives-up-to-its-name\" type=\"external\">presumed critics of it</a>. But that might be too simple of an explanation. After all, the U.S. government sometimes claims this is its goal. At times the goal may well be not &#8220;regime change&#8221; but No Regime.</p> \n\n<p>Perhaps the U.S. establishments would like subservient leaders in Syria and Iraq and Libya. But these are significant counties with population, some resources and some capacity for independence. This is in contrast with Gulf sheikdoms and other monarchies like Jordan which are effectively client states of the U.S.</p> \n\n<p>So, if permanent subservience is not possible, then a crippled country, with the possibility of dismemberment, is a fairly good option for those intent on ensuring U.S.-Israel-Saudi dominance of the region. At least for the time being.</p> \n\n<p>Keep the fighting, keep the bleeding. Keep the people of the Mideast divided and fighting while the U.S. establishment solidifies its plans on how it will &#8220;pick up the remnants.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The phrase &#8220;Deep State&#8221; has been in vogue of late, as if it&#8217;s an entity that Donald Trump were out to undo even as he empowers it. But what does that really mean? A bureaucracy, perhaps. But more than anything, I think it&#8217;s an articulation of policy that the U.S. government pursues that dare not speak its name.</p> \n\n<p>Sam Husseini is founder of <a href=\"http://www.votepact.org/\" type=\"external\">VotePact.org</a>, which works for left-right cooperation.

The Times has now <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html?_r=0\" type=\"external\">followed up</a> with further on-the-record reports of sexual harassment from more women.</p> \n\n<p>Some of the women who spoke out did so anonymously, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/upshot/its-not-just-fox-why-women-dont-report-sexual-harassment.html\" type=\"external\">fearing retribution</a> from an extremely rich and powerful man with millions of dollars and high-profile connections at his disposal and a loudly and frequently discussed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxwelltani/status/917767769558601729\" type=\"external\">penchant for personally attacking women he&#8217;s already attempted to victimize</a>. Others, including well-known actresses Ashley Judd, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Angelina Jolie, have also spoken on the record about Weinstein&#8217;s harassment. It is likely, given the nature of these accounts and the prevailing culture of dismissing and demeaning survivors, that more will choose to speak out, and still others will choose not to.</p> \n\n<p>The primary public conversation beginning to play out now is familiar: How has our culture -- in film, in politics, across all partisan divides -- allowed this violence to persist for so long? Why and how do our current systems work to keep women fearful and silent? Will any of it change? It remains to be seen if any of these questions will earn an answer, or whether they will, once again, fade back out of the spotlight, labeled as persistent, unsolvable issues. Nothing can be done to protect the vulnerable from the powerful, it seems.</p> \n\n<p>A secondary conversation is also emerging, centered more squarely on the media: What is the responsibility of journalists -- tasked with reporting the facts and acting in the public interest -- when they encounter serial interpersonal violence that&#8217;s been allowed to persist without public knowledge?</p> \n\n<p>The fact remains that journalists have a choice, every time: Do what can be done, following industry standards, to expose the truth and aide the powerless, or resort to becoming a tool for exploitation.</p> \n\n<p>The Weinstein reports -- and before them the Bill O&#8217;Reilly reports, the Roger Ailes reports, the Bill Cosby reports, the Woody Allen reports, the Roman Polanski reports, the Donald Trump reports, on and on -- have showcased these options repeatedly.</p> \n\n<p>The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html\" type=\"external\">doggedly reported</a> on multiple sexual harassment lawsuits against Fox News host Bill O&#8217;Reilly in April. Fox <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">fired</a> O&#8217;Reilly only when it was <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">finally forced to do so</a>. The network paid him <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/business/media/bill-oreilly-payout.html\" type=\"external\">$25 million</a> on the way out, then <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">invited him back</a> onto Hannity months later because it was scared of Rachel Maddow and, besides, O&#8217;Reilly had a <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">new book</a> to promote. O&#8217;Reilly also appeared on NBC&#8217;s Today for an <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">uncomfortable and unnecessary interview</a> with Matt Lauer in which he <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">attempted to publicly disparage a woman who had reported him</a>. He <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">referred</a> to an article on the right-wing site Newsmax.com, cross-posted to O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s personal website, that he touted as a redeeming investigation.</p> \n\n<p>Earlier, Fox also pushed out Roger Ailes when it was finally forced to do so. It handed the former Fox News chairman and CEO <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-roger-ailes-gretchen-carlson-payout_us_57cee12ce4b02c637c57d8b0\" type=\"external\">$40 million</a> as he left, and the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">people who enabled his serial harassment</a> simply closed ranks. <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">The culture didn&#8217;t change</a>. When Ailes died months later, he was fondly and emotionally eulogized on air, with no thoughtful discussion of his <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">real legacy</a> of hurting and silencing women.</p> \n\n<p>Like Weinstein&#8217;s behavior, Cosby&#8217;s violent misconduct was an &#8220; <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/i-warned-you-about-bill-cosby-in-2007\" type=\"external\">open secret</a>&#8221; in their industry, allowed to persist in part because society has taught us not to listen to women when they do come forward, and in part because women have been silenced by the culture around them and terrified of retaliation should they speak out. According to <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/media-enablers-harvey-weinstein-new-york-times/\" type=\"external\">one account</a>, actors Matt Damon and Russell Crowe may have personally worked to quash a 2004 New York Times article about Weinstein&#8217;s serial predatory misconduct. Weinstein also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxwelltani/status/917767769558601729\" type=\"external\">reportedly bragged</a> about placing negative articles about people who dared to speak out about him. Indeed, even as he issued his non-apology, Weinstein was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-harvey-weinstein/harvey-weinstein-threatens-to-sue-new-york-times-over-harassment-story-idUSKBN1CA2JX\" type=\"external\">threatening to sue</a> the Times.</p> \n\n<p>Just over a year ago, The Washington Post&#8217;s David Fahrenthold <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\" type=\"external\">published</a> audio of President Donald Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women. NBC, then-employer of TV host Billy Bush who was also featured in the tape, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/17/media/billy-bush-leaves-nbc/index.html\" type=\"external\">subsequently fired Bush</a>. Network executives reportedly <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/trump-tape-nbc-news-access-hollywood-billy-bush-214344\" type=\"external\">knew about the tape</a> but&amp;#160;hadn&#8217;t reported on it yet, instead beat to the story by a competitor. (This week, Ronan Farrow wrote of new sexual assault and rape reports against Weinstein in The New Yorker -- though he is an NBC employee.) And in the months prior to the release of the Trump recording, television news writ large <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">remained virtually silent</a> on another report of sexual harassment and sexual assault committed by Trump.</p> \n\n<p>Responsible journalists recognize that serial sexual violence, particularly when perpetrated by society&#8217;s most powerful, is a difficult story to tell. Survivors are rightfully fearful of retribution, in keeping with the warped and disgusting power dynamic reaffirmed by the personal violence they&#8217;re already endured. They&#8217;re also often stymied by the culture of silence around sexual harassment and assault. The powerful people reported for misconduct -- frequently white, almost always men -- have the best lawyers their millions can buy. They have friends -- also frequently white, frequently men, always wealthy -- who will stand by them, defend them on TV, make movies with them, call newspapers to keep the story under wraps for another day.</p> \n\n<p>Reporters have a responsibility to report the truth, particularly when it challenges the abuse of power, with all available tools and at any cost. They have a responsibility to work against those abuses of power, giving voice to the voiceless without compromising their safety and sparing no question. They have a responsibility to afford no comfort to powerful men who have not earned protection, but instead have used their outsized power to steal that of others. Kudos to those doing this hard and crucial -- in fact, morally imperative -- work; they should be examples to the rest.</p>", "title": "Lesson of horrific Weinstein reports: Be a voice for the oppressed, or help the oppressors stay in power", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://mediamatters.org/blog/2017/10/10/lesson-horrific-weinstein-reports-be-voice-oppressed-or-help-oppressors-stay-power/218187", "published_at": "2017-10-10", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>George Zimmerman continues to play 'celebrity.'

McMaster as calming forces in a turbulent presidency.</p> \n\n<p>Discipline, though, is only one of the traits companies say military leaders bring to boards and management teams.</p> \n\n<p>In the fog of war, and in peacetime, generals are trained to anticipate unknown risks, build high-functioning teams and make quick, strategic decisions in high-pressure situations. \"They are the same traits necessary in the fog of business,\" says Henry Stoever, a captain in the Marine Corps who is now chief marketing officer of the National Association of Corporate Directors.</p> \n\n<p>The group has put some 500 retired generals and admirals through a three-day course to prepare them for corporate board duty; half of them now sit on private and public boards, including those of Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Co., USA Truck Inc. and aerospace supplier Wesco Aircraft Holdings Inc.</p> \n\n<p>Companies, especially those in crisis, covet the reputational boost that comes from seeking the counsel of a former military leader, says Wendy Monsen, president of executive recruiter Korn/Ferry's federal-government practice. Whereas more than three-quarters of Americans trust the military to act in the public's interest, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center survey, only 41% feel the same way about business leaders.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>For companies seeking cybersecurity skills or geopolitical know-how, \"general officers end up on our short list quite a bit for industry clients,\" says Ms. Monsen.</p> \n\n<p>However, outside the defense industry, military brass remain rare in c-suites and boardrooms. The number of top executives who once served has shrunk over the decades as Vietnam War-era veterans have retired. Among S&amp;amp;P 500 firms, only 13 are led by former service members, and just under 5% of their combined board members are veterans, according to S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence data.</p> \n\n<p>Rather than barking orders and enforcing hierarchy, military leaders who succeed in the corporate world know how to coax different groups into collaborating, says retired Army Maj. Gen. Michael J. Diamond, an organizational leadership consultant.</p> \n\n<p>Before her retirement in 2013, Maj. Gen. Suzanne Vautrinot led the U.S. Air Force's cyber operations. She has parlayed that expertise into board seats at companies such as Wells Fargo and water treatment- and cleaning-products maker Ecolab Inc.</p> \n\n<p>Like many senior officers in the private sector, Gen. Vautrinot urges others not to call her by her Air Force title, instead going by \"Zan.\" Ecolab Chief Executive Doug Baker says her disarming style lets her push her points without ruffling feathers. \"Think about that generation of women generals,\" he says. \"You have to have pretty good [emotional intelligence] skills, and she does.\"</p> \n\n<p>Gen. Vautrinot says she examines company strategies much like military leaders are trained to do: \"You're looking at the future and connecting the dots, and you're looking at the risks,\" she said. \"If the assumptions that went into the strategy change, how do you think about adjusting?\" The approach \"isn't unique to me as a military member,\" she says, \"but it is inherent.\"</p> \n\n<p>Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling brought disparate brigades and regiments into a cohesive force as commander of the U.S. Army Europe. Similar challenges awaited when he joined Florida Hospital in 2013. Hired to develop idea-exchanges and other partnerships abroad, he soon after was asked to devise a leadership course for doctors, in part to improve collaboration with administrators and get physicians more involved in broader decisions at the 32,000-employee hospital group.</p> \n\n<p>Gen. Hertling's course culminates in several dozen doctors, nurses and administrators going to Gettysburg, Pa., each year. There, he assigns each to be a different figure in the pivotal Civil War battle; afterward the staff discuss how the lessons apply to health care. \"They really dig into that person's personality and see how their achievements or dysfunctions contributed to the bigger disaster or accomplishment,\" he says.</p> \n\n<p>Generals learn lessons, too. After retiring from the Army seven years ago, Lt. Gen. Stephen Speakes developed enterprise strategy at financial-services firm USAA for three years before he was let go. In hindsight, he says he failed to grasp the need to build consensus around his decisions and didn't recognize when colleagues weren't on board.</p> \n\n<p>\"In my old days, I was a decision-making machine. It was a quick look around the room and if no one had objections, it was go,\" he says. \"In the corporate world, once you make a decision, you have to continue to sell its execution.\"</p> \n\n<p>Now rounding his fourth year as CEO of Kalmar Rough Terrain Center LLC, a Texas unit of cargo-equipment maker Cargotec, Gen. Speakes says he has learned to encourage staff input and allow time for them to get behind ideas.</p> \n\n<p>He keeps up other practices honed during his 35-year military career, such as making sure he knows the situation on the ground, frequently holding company meetings on the plant floor. \"When manufacturing companies get too big, the leaders leave the manufacturing floor,\" he says. But \"the people on the line will tell you in a heartbeat what's going on and why.\"</p> \n\n<p>Write to Vanessa Fuhrmans at vanessa.fuhrmans@wsj.com</p> \n\n<p>(END) Dow Jones Newswires</p> \n\n<p>August 29, 2017 08:14 ET (12:14 GMT)</p>", "title": "Generals Bring Battlefield Expertise to the Business World", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2017/08/29/generals-bring-battlefield-expertise-to-business-world.html", "published_at": "2017-08-29", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>It might seem counterintuitive, but sometimes, the best stocks to buy are the ones that are trading near their 52-week highs. The reason is that winners tend to keep on winning, so jumping in after a company has made a bullish move can often lead to market-beating gains.</p> \n\n<p>Which recent winners do we think are worth paying up to own? We asked that question to a team of Motley Fool investors, and they picked Rio Tinto plc (NYSE: RIO),&amp;#160;Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ: TTWO), and Mazor Robotics (NASDAQ: MZOR).</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/ReubenGBrewer/activity.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=3845d258-949d-11e7-b617-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Reuben Gregg Brewer Opens a New Window.</a> (Rio Tinto plc): Rio Tinto's shares have been on a tear since commodity prices started to move higher in early 2016. If you step in here, you have to keep in mind that commodity prices will have a huge impact on Rio's stock. That's particularly true for iron ore, which made up around 62% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and 80% of underlying earnings through the first half of 2017.</p> \n\n<p>But here's the thing: Rio's business is really getting better. For example, it used the upturn in commodity prices to improve its <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/how-to-invest/how-to-value-stocks-how-to-read-a-balance-sheet-de.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=3845d258-949d-11e7-b617-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">balance sheet Opens a New Window.</a>, reducing long-term debt by nearly 14% in the first six months of the year, or roughly $2.3 billion dollars. But go back to the start of 2016, right before the commodity upturn, and Rio has cut long-term debt by nearly 30%, or around $6 billion.</p> \n\n<p>Long-term debt stands at a very reasonable 25% (or so) of the capital structure. Rio added debt to make it through the downturn, but is now prudently cutting debt as commodity markets recover.</p> \n\n<p>In addition, it's still expanding its business, even as it works to mend its balance sheet. It's got a few major projects in the works, with its Silvergrass iron-ore development expected to be fully commissioned later this year, the Amrun bauxite project set for 2019, and the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine on track for 2020. Like all miners, it cut back on capital spending during the downturn, but it clearly didn't stop spending on the projects it believed will position it best for the future. As those efforts bear fruit, the fundamentals of Rio's business will get stronger.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Commodity prices will always have a big impact on Rio's top and bottom lines. There's nothing it can do about that. But the improvement on the balance sheet and its strategic investments are things it can control -- and those efforts are paying off.</p> \n\n<p>Yes, the stock is hitting highs, but the underlying improvement in the business is real. Rio has not only proven on a fundamental level that it's a survivor, but also that it's a miner with plans to keep getting better in good times and bad. That remains true no matter what the price is today.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/keithnoonan/info.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=3845d258-949d-11e7-b617-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Keith Noonan Opens a New Window.</a>&amp;#160;(Take-Two Interactive):&amp;#160;Most known for its hugely successful&amp;#160;Grand Theft Auto&amp;#160;video game series, Take-Two Interactive has been on a huge winning streak. Shares are up roughly 850% over the last five years and have nearly doubled year to date.</p> \n\n<p>My thesis on whether Take-Two can continue to deliver stellar returns for shareholders can be simplified to three questions. Naturally, its performance will be affected by additional factors, but these are the drivers that best explain why I'm still bullish on the game publisher -- even at record prices.</p> \n\n<p>First, is Grand Theft Auto (GTA)&amp;#160;a property at the top of its popularity, or can it still expand its audience and sales? As the overall games industry has grown, GTA&amp;#160;has grown with it, with each mainline installment selling more than its immediate predecessor.</p> \n\n<p>GTA V&amp;#160;has shipped more than 80 million copies -- an incredible feat. I think the next installment has the potential to match or exceed the most recent release's profits if Take-Two takes the smart, and somewhat obvious, route after <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/07/08/take-two-interactives-grand-theft-auto-v-is-more-t.aspx?source=iaasitlnk0000003&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=3845d258-949d-11e7-b617-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">GTA V's performance Opens a New Window.</a>&amp;#160;-- and focuses on the sequel's online mode. It would need to release the game at the tail end of the current console cycle to take advantage of user-base size, and then release an updated version for the next generation of video game hardware.</p> \n\n<p>Next, does it look like the company's broader stable of properties is gaining strength? Again, the outlook is promising. With franchises like&amp;#160;NBA 2K,&amp;#160;Red Dead Redemption, and&amp;#160;Borderlands, a team of proven development studios, and the company's bigger push into mobile gaming, Take-Two has what it takes to benefit from industry momentum and capture the next level of growth with an expanding portfolio of franchises.</p> \n\n<p>Finally, will the company continue to benefit from growth of high-margin digital sales? With video games transitioning to digital distribution, players showing increasing appetites for in-game purchases, and a strong group of franchises to work with, Take-Two is on track to deliver wins here, as well.</p> \n\n<p>As the global games market continues to expand, Take-Two is positioned to be one of the biggest winners. I think long-term investors have the potential for substantial gains with the stock, even at today's record prices.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFTypeoh/info.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=3845d258-949d-11e7-b617-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Brian Feroldi Opens a New Window.</a> (Mazor Robotics):&amp;#160;I've been an investor&amp;#160;in the&amp;#160;robotic surgery upstart Mazor Robotics for <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/07/im-already-up-over-200-on-the-next-intuitive-surgi.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=3845d258-949d-11e7-b617-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">several years now</a>. While I knew that the company was highly speculative when I first purchased shares, I was attracted to Mazor's razor-and-blade business model. My willingness to invest so early has allowed me to triple my money in less than three years.</p> \n\n<p>Despite the huge gains, I still think that it makes sense for interested investors to pick up a few shares today. My reasoning is that the company recently released some big news related to its strategic alliance with Medtronic (NYSE: MDT). For those who haven't been following this story closely, Medtronic signed a <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/05/28/does-mazor-robotics-deal-with-medtronic-make-it-2.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=3845d258-949d-11e7-b617-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">transformative deal Opens a New Window.</a> with Mazor last year where it agreed to&amp;#160;co-market Mazor Robotics' systems. The deal also called for Medtronic to become a major investor in Mazor, and also granted it the right to deepen its investment in the company if the first phase of the partnership went well.</p> \n\n<p>Just a few days ago, we learned that Medtronic agreed to expand its relationship with Mazor earlier than expected. The new deal makes Medtronic into the exclusive provider of the Mazor X Surgical Assurance Platform and its accessories. In addition, Medtronic also agreed to invest another $40 million into Mazor and committed to annual minimums for Mazor X system purchases.</p> \n\n<p>Medtronic agreed to this move because phase one of the partnership led to 59 Mazor X system sales in less than nine months' time. That represents a significant acceleration when compared to what Mazor was able to sell on its own.</p> \n\n<p>When this news broke, Mazor's stock immediately jumped to a 52-week high, which makes sense because this deal promises to be a financial windfall for the company. With Mazor's growth trajectory now on firm footing, I'm much more confident that the company's future is looking bright. That's why I think it still makes sense to get in today, even though shares are trading quite close to their all time high.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than Take-Two Interactive SoftwareWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Over the past six-plus decades, Buffett has grown his personal wealth from just shy of $10,000 to $68 billion. Although Buffett may not be correct on every investment he's made throughout the years, his overwhelming growth in net worth, coupled with his willingness to share what the stock market has taught him over multiple decades, has transformed him into the face of long-term investing.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Best of all, Buffett makes his thoughts readily available via an annual shareholder letter, as well as through Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting, which typically draws around 40,000 shareholders and is set up as a multi-day event. Buffett also isn't shy about doing interviews with a host of financial news agencies. In other words, we don't have to look far to find the next great nugget of wisdom from Buffett.</p> \n\n<p>Warren Buffett's best nugget of wisdom is somewhat strange Previously, I've listed some of my <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2012/02/22/the-25-smartest-things-warren-buffett-ever-said-.aspx?source=eptfxblnk0000004\" type=\"external\">favorite Buffett quotes Opens a New Window.</a>, as well as some of the reasoning behind why they're so meaningful. However, with Buffett regularly talking to the media and his shareholders, <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/07/13-brand-new-warren-buffett-quotes-youve-got-to-se.aspx?source=eptfxblnk0000004\" type=\"external\">new nuggets of wisdom Opens a New Window.</a> emerge quite frequently. But if my arm were twisted and I needed to choose one particular Buffett quote that stands out, this might be it:</p> \n\n<p>In other words, Warren Buffett loves it when stocks he owns or is buying fall, which is somewhat strange since it's the complete opposite of what we're taught when becoming investors. When we buy something, the last thing we want to see is any sort of red ink in the profit/loss column. But that's not how Buffett thinks. A solid company that's entered a period of temporary problems represents the perfect opportunity for a long-term investor like Buffett to add to his position. Best of all, since it's unlikely we're going to invest a huge amount of money at any one time, a falling stock allows us to wade into our position, which can improve our cost basis.</p> \n\n<p>A perfect example of this thesis in action has been Buffet's incremental purchases of technology giant IBM . Even though Buffett has been quite frank that his bullishness could be misplaced, he's not been shy about adding to IBM since his first purchase during Q1 2011. He views IBM's languishing stock price as an opportunity, and he's counting on Big Blue making a slow but steady transition into the cloud. Based on Berkshire's 13-F filed in mid-February, his company owned just over 81 million shares of IBM, equal to $11.9 billion, or 8.3% of all outstanding shares.</p> \n\n<p>Stocks that'll have you investing like BuffettHowever, we don't have to stick within the confines of Buffett's portfolio to find solid businesses that have fallen on perceived-to-be temporary hard times and look ripe for the picking by long-term investors.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Take biotech giant Gilead Sciences as a good example -- a company Buffett himself would be unlikely to buy, since biotech companies require constant observation because of clinical trial data.</p> \n\n<p>Two weeks ago Gilead Sciences reported first-quarter results that had investors running for the exit. Despite delivering modest sales and EPS growth, sales of its blockbuster hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug Harvoni fell 14% from the prior-year quarter to $3.01 billion. With Harvoni viewed as Gilead's main recent growth driver, investors knocked Gilead's share price down by double-digits on the news.</p> \n\n<p>But this is more than likely an instance of temporary problems rather than something for long-term investors to worry about. Pricing pressures on Harvoni were to be expected as new once-daily HCV entrants hit the market, and Gilead responded by offering bigger gross-to-net discounts during the first quarter. Despite these challenges, Gilead didn't lose HCV market share, and its primary rival in convenience, Zepatier, a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration in late January, sold just $50 million.</p> \n\n<p>Looking ahead, Gilead could have a pan-genotypic HCV therapy approved before the end of June, which could reignite its already dominant HCV sales, and it recently had the FDA approve its next-generation oral HIV medication Genvoya. Genvoya contains a new formulation of tenofovir that's designed to increase its concentration in infected cells while reducing its concentration throughout the remainder of the bloodstream. This has few, if any, markings of a broken stock.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Flickr user Karlis Dambrans.</p> \n\n<p>The same could be said of technology giant Apple , another stock Buffett probably wouldn't buy since he generally has an aversion to tech stocks.</p> \n\n<p>Apple reported its second-quarter results a few days prior to Gilead, and the reaction was pretty similar (save for the fact that Apple's valuation tumbled by more than the worth of 477 of 500 S&amp;amp;P 500 companies). Apple announced Q2 sales of $50.6 billion, a 13% decline from the prior-year quarter and its first year-over-year sales decline in 13 years; it delivered $1.90 in EPS, missing Wall Street's estimates by a mile; and it reported its first iPhone sales decline ever! You can certainly see why skittish investors ran for cover.</p> \n\n<p>Yet for long-term investors, Apple's decline could represent the perfect opportunity to wade into the water and build, or add to, a position. Apple still has the world's most valuable brand according to Interbrand in 2015, and it undoubtedly has some of the most loyal customers of any company. When it introduces new products and services, and expands its Apple brand platform, chances are very good that its loyal customers will be buyers. Whether it be the iPhone, the recently launched Apple Music, or the highly anticipated iCar by the end of the decade, Apple has products to inspire growth.</p> \n\n<p>Long-term investors can also take solace in the fact that Apple has substantial cash flow. Apple ended Q2 with roughly $230 billion in cash, and it's capable of tacking on $40 billion-plus in cash every year, including its generous share repurchase and dividend return. Thus, by the end of the decade Apple could be sporting in excess of $400 billion in cash! Again, this is hardly what I'd call a broken stock.</p> \n\n<p>These are just two examples of downtrodden stocks that could have you investing like Buffett.

At this point, there&#8217;s very little Mitt Romney can do to win the election other than hope for a big slip-up from President Obama. Regardless, Romney appears to be shifting tactics again just days after his campaign announced its candidate would alter his strategy. The new message emerging from the campaign: Romney will change Washington, D.C., from the inside. That&#8217;s the exact opposite position of what he took when he campaigned against John McCain in 2007.

Scott Brown, R-Mass., could not be coaxed to say Mitt Romney&#8217;s name during a debate Thursday night with Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren. However, Brown &#8212; who is locked in a tough battle with Warren to retain his Senate seat &#8212; did offer praise for Hillary Clinton. &#8220;I think Secretary Clinton is doing a great job,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told her that and I think she&#8217;s really a bright star in that administration.

Republicans are continuing their efforts to redefine rape and effectively limit in scope what constitutes sexual assault. In New Mexico, for example, Gov.

Where has it been hardest to make progress? Wages, housing, schools?&#8221; Chris Smith asked.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s been hardest is the way our legal system is structured to favor private property,&#8221; de Blasio said. &#8220;I think people all over this city, of every background, would like to have the city government be able to determine which building goes where, how high it will be, who gets to live in it, what the rent will be.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Wait a second &#8212; de Blasio thinks residents of New York want the city to decide who gets to live in what buildings? &amp;#160;No wonder we like to refer to him as &#8220;Comrade&#8221; de Blasio. &amp;#160;But there&#8217;s more.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a socialistic impulse, which I hear every day, in every kind of community, that they would like things to be planned in accordance to their needs,&#8221; he added, apparently drawing from the Communist maxim of &#8220;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He then admitted his desire for central planning: &#8220;And I would, too. Unfortunately, what stands in the way of that is hundreds of years of history that have elevated property rights and wealth to the point that that&#8217;s the reality that calls the tune on a lot of development.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He added:</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;ll give you an example. I was down one day on Varick Street, somewhere close to Canal, and there was a big sign out front of a new condo saying, &#8220;Units start at $2 million.&#8221; And that just drives people stark raving mad in this city, because that kind of development is clearly not for everyday people. It&#8217;s almost like it&#8217;s being flaunted. Look, if I had my druthers, the city government would determine every single plot of land, how development would proceed. And there would be very stringent requirements around income levels and rents. That&#8217;s a world I&#8217;d love to see, and I think what we have, in this city at least, are people who would love to have the New Deal back, on one level. They&#8217;d love to have a very, very powerful government, including a federal government, involved in directly addressing their day-to-day reality.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s not reachable right now. And it leaves this friction, and this anger, which is visceral. I try to explain the things we can do. It&#8217;s a little bit of a Serenity Prayer &#8212; let&#8217;s talk about the things we can fix. The rent freeze we did reached over 2 million people.In 2015 and 2016, the mayor&#8217;s appointees ruled that new one-year leases on rent-stabilized units could not increase. I&#8217;ve talked to people who were going to be evicted, and we stopped the eviction by giving them a free lawyer.

I will never resign.&#8221; And thus far there has been no proof of wrongdoing on her part. Still, the calls for her resignation are relentless. There have also been no charges against Lula, despite a swirl of rumors and three hours of questioning during his recent detention by police that some characterized as a kidnapping. Lula has stated he will run for president again in 2018, which may be part of what the right fears.</p> \n\n<p>Meleiza Figueroa, an American doctoral student at the University of California at Berkeley and an occasional Truthdig contributor, is currently living in Brazil and conducting research in the Amazon. <a href=\"http://www.risingupwithsonali.com/brazils-ruling-party-in-disarray-after-attempt-to-shield-lula/\" type=\"external\">In a Skype interview</a> from the municipality of Santar&#233;m in the state of Par&#225;, she described what is unfolding in Brazil as &#8220;a naked power grab on the part of the right-wing elites.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>But among conservative or even mainstream media, one word is bandied about as a catchall to indict PT officials: corruption. For example, one author characterizes <a href=\"http://mironline.ca/?p=9872\" type=\"external\">the ubiquitous protest sign &#8220;Fora Dilma&#8221;</a> (which translates to &#8220;Out Dilma&#8221;) as &#8220;A People&#8217;s Quest to End Corruption.&#8221; But, as Figueroa noted, Brazil&#8217;s political system is based on low levels of corruption through local patronage systems that have existed for centuries, not just since the PT assumed power. The PT&#8217;s mistake was to not &#8220;overturn the old order &#8230; instead they tried to work within the existing system and allied themselves with some of the people that engaged in this type of political culture,&#8221; she explained. On the flip side, &#8220;The PT, more than any other government, has prosecuted officials for corruption.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The Brazilian federal police have named their investigation into the allegations of government corruption &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35725415\" type=\"external\">Operation Car Wash</a>.&#8221; But according to Figueroa, critics point out that &#8220;the people who are investigating Operation Car Wash are the people who are even more dirty.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Manufactured political crises often require the prominent role of media in whipping up public indignation and frenzy. To that end, aiding Brazil&#8217;s right-wing opposition parties is the popular television network Globo, which has been airing wall-to-wall coverage of the mass anti-government mobilizations across the country. Speaking to teleSUR, media critic Sylvia Moretzsohn explained that Globo acts to &#8220;create the conditions for a coup. They want make it so the public is in favor of the ouster of Dilma, but always in the name of a noble cause: the fight against corruption.&#8221; Globo recently leaked intercepted calls between Lula and Rousseff discussing responses to their detractors&#8212;which generated a predictable level of public outrage.</p> \n\n<p>Globo is covering the anti-PT mobilizations in a way it has never done for left-wing actions, said Figueroa. Footage of the protests shows largely white, well-dressed crowds, similar to the opposition seen in Venezuela. Figueroa cited an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35824122\" type=\"external\">image that went viral</a> because of the racial politics it represents: &#8220;a white couple going to a protest with their dog, and their black maid following them with a stroller carrying their two daughters.&#8221; The BBC wrote that the photo &#8220;became a symbol of how polarized Brazil is over the current protests,&#8221; and cited one individual&#8217;s online observation that &#8220;What the picture says, between the lines, is that you are asking for a better world for yourself as a white employer, and for your perfect family, while the black nanny continues to be a maid.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Eerily echoing the sentiment of Donald Trump&#8217;s slogan &#8220;Make America Great Again&#8221; are Brazilian protesters who say they &#8220;want their country back,&#8221; a parallel thread to right-wing American anger. Sections of Brazil&#8217;s middle and upper classes are seething with resentment over the perceived notion that liberal government forces have coddled poor people and ruined class distinctions. Of course, impoverished classes in Brazil and the U.S. never receive government subsidies big enough to fully lift them out of poverty.Sadly, the PT is not helping its own cause. Over the past several years, the party has adopted austerity measures and environmentally disastrous policies that have alienated its base of working-class communities. Figueroa cited mass demonstrations in 2013 as an expression of anger that lower-middle-class Brazilians felt over the nation&#8217;s economic downtown. During that era of upheaval, she said, &#8220;There were two sides. There was a left wing that was demanding more services, more redistribution, more help for people.&#8221; But &#8220;[t]here was [also] a right wing which took this anti-corruption narrative and ran with it, aided by Globo.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Conservatives were able to exploit public anger so well that the last congressional elections yielded huge wins for opposition parties. Among them was the &#8220;Ruralistas,&#8221; a bloc representing land-owning elites, which has directly targeted redistribution policies and the rights of indigenous communities.</p> \n\n<p>PT supporters have taken to the streets in counterprotests to defend the party&#8217;s stated adherence to policies that benefit poor and working-class Brazilians. Despite the PT&#8217;s recent failures, there is an understanding that conservatives want to roll back the decade and a half of progressive reforms. One protester <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/police-fire-tear-gas-protests-against-brazils-president-023854502.html\" type=\"external\">defending Lula and Rousseff</a> told Agence France-Presse, &#8220;This is a coup by the right.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Liberal parties like the PT face a conundrum in Latin American democracies&#8212;one that Venezuela&#8217;s Bolivarian revolution has had to navigate time and again&#8212;and that is that liberalism and its tolerance for political activity offer openings to right-wing parties that have no qualms about exploiting democratic expression (such as a free press, the right to assemble publicly, etc.) in order to quash democracy.</p> \n\n<p>The stakes are high, especially in Brazil, where climate policies can have a global impact. Already, Figueroa is noticing that in the Brazilian Amazon, &#8220;As soon as this political crisis began, there was a push to run over all of the regulations and the governmental protections that have been put into place for the rain forest.&#8221; Indigenous groups and environmental activists had managed, among other things, to institutionalize curbs on deforestation through the PT. But in the past year, rates of deforestation, which had been declining, jumped back up.</p> \n\n<p>The BBC <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35831833\" type=\"external\">characterized the situation</a> with a headline that read, &#8220;Brazil tumbles like &#8216;House of Cards&#8217; in crisis.&#8221; Figueroa does not think this is an overstatement. &#8220;What the right wing seeks is the complete destruction of the Workers Party, the real gains that the population has made, and the remaining barriers to unfettered capitalist development,&#8221; she said. Unless the PT and its supporters can stave off the attacks, Brazil may indeed go the way of Ecuador and Honduras.</p>", "title": "\u2018This Is a Coup\u2019: Brazil's Workers Party Faces Its Greatest Test", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/this-is-a-coup-brazils-workers-party-faces-its-greatest-test/", "published_at": "2016-03-24", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>In their biggest plunge in just over a year, shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) tumbled more than 7% Tuesday morning as investors fret over the tech titan&#8217;s <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">lower-than-expected iPhone sales</a> and cautious guidance.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>The focus on iPhone sales and guidance for the fiscal second quarter overshadowed a solid earnings beat for the consumer-electronics giant.</p> \n\n<p>Still, Apple&#8217;s results prompted a slew of analysts to trim their price targets on the company&#8217;s shares as concerns persist about heavy competition in the smartphone market.</p> \n\n<p>Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) cut its valuation range on Apple to between $505 and $575, down from $536 to $581 previously.

Polls showed a neck-and-neck race in the state that voted overwhelmingly for the Republican candidate in 2012. Mormons, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/mormons-vs-trump?utm_term=.rfDdKPDRY#.vqrA92GDo\" type=\"external\">news stories said</a>, were deeply offended by the boorish GOP nominee, who was everything they detested: a mean, philandering, sexist, immoral lout who had the nerve <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-mitt-romney-election-choke-2016-4\" type=\"external\">to make fun of</a> their beloved Mitt Romney. State leaders, including Republican Sen. Mike Lee, declared their opposition to him. The Deseret News, owned by the LDS church, <a href=\"http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865664336/In-our-opinion-Donald-Trump-should-resign-his-candidacy.html?pg=all\" type=\"external\">called on Trump</a> to drop out of the race last month.</p> \n\n<p>But while it made for an interesting political drama, Trump&#8212;who has outperformed expectations around the country and may be closing in on a victory&#8212;was never likely to lose Utah. And that&#8217;s partly because the main alternative, Hillary Clinton, was a woman.</p> \n\n<p>Utah can be a difficult place to be a woman. The patriarchal culture of the state&#8217;s dominant religion is strong. Women aren&#8217;t allowed to be ordained as leaders in the LDS church, and they&#8217;re taught to be subordinate to men. The religious viewpoint is reflected in the state&#8217;s politics. No woman holds statewide office in Utah. Only 15 percent of the state Legislature is female, compared with 24 percent nationally and 42 percent in neighboring Colorado.</p> \n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.utahchildren.org/images/pdfs/2015/GenderGap.pdf\" type=\"external\">pay gap</a> between men and women in Utah is the fourth-highest in the nation, with women making only 70 cents for every dollar made by a man. Utah has one of the worst gender gaps in the country in college graduation rates, and the depth of the education gap may be further masked by all the bachelor&#8217;s degrees given out by church-owned Brigham Young University in &#8220; <a href=\"https://familylife.byu.edu/\" type=\"external\">family and consumer sciences,</a>&#8221; with college courses like &#8220;Preparation for Marriage,&#8221; interior design, and food preparation in the home&#8212;classes dominated by women.</p> \n\n<p>The state has extensive abortion restrictions, and until just recently BYU made a practice of <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/29/health/brigham-young-university-rape/\" type=\"external\">punishing students who were the victims of sexual assault</a>, with collusion from the local Provo police department, which reported them to the school. It&#8217;s not a place where women were likely feeling empowered to be &#8220;with her.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I think that internalized misogyny is what will ultimately lead Mormon women to vote against their best interests,&#8221; predicted Utah activist Kate Kelly when I spoke with her last month. Kelly is a Mormon feminist who was ex-communicated from the church in 2014 for advocating the ordination of women, so she has some experience in this department. &#8220;They won&#8217;t say, &#8216;I&#8217;m not voting for Hillary because she&#8217;s a woman.&#8217; They&#8217;ll use coded language. &#8216;She&#8217;s deceitful, she&#8217;s too shrill, she&#8217;s immoral.'&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The education deficit between men and women in the state may have reduced the likelihood that the state&#8217;s women would vote for Clinton, given Trump&#8217;s success with less educated voters. One of the reasons Trump lagged in the polls nationally is that women deserted him in droves, with Clinton <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/\" type=\"external\">leading among women</a>, at various points, by between 15 and 33 points. That wasn&#8217;t the case in Utah, where <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_UT_110316/\" type=\"external\">polls heading into the election</a> showed a small gender difference, with 40 percent of men and 33 percent of women backing Trump.</p> \n\n<p>Clinton put Utahans, particularly Mormon women, in a genuine bind. &#8220;It&#8217;s this interesting conundrum, where we can&#8217;t vote for Trump because he&#8217;s an unmitigated slimeball, but we can&#8217;t vote for Hillary because she&#8217;s everything we&#8217;re taught not to be,&#8221; says Kelly. &#8220;She&#8217;s the opposite of the pedestal paradigm that Mormon women are told to strive for. She works outside the home. She doesn&#8217;t cook. She talks powerfully and stridently about important high-level issues. All of these things are very frowned upon by Mormon women, and in a way, they&#8217;re afraid of them.&#8221; And in the end, Kelly says, to vote for Clinton, Mormon women might have to take a hard look at their own faith. &#8220;If women can&#8217;t be leaders in our church but they can be the leader of the free world,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what does that say about our church?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Hillary Clinton Was Never Going to Win Utah", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2016/11/why-hillary-lost-utah/", "published_at": "2016-11-09", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\" />It&#8217;s 2003 all over again, as Iraq &#8220;experts&#8221; who promoted the 2003 invasion are back on TV screens offering expert analysis about what to do next.

To Donald J. Trump goes the distinction of having been caught in verbal flagrante&#8212;bragging about his attacks on women as he bantered off-camera&#8212;so he thought&#8212;with an accommodating interviewer. Despite the chorus of victims who confirmed his boasts, Americans elected him president.</p> \n\n<p>Males have lorded it over females for millennia. Men of every race, religion, and party have abused women.&amp;#160; Now we &amp;#160;like to think that moral standards have been raised.&amp;#160; We take it for granted that gender exploitation is a violation of basic human rights.&amp;#160; Accordingly, Democrats have pressed Senators John Conyers and Al Franken to leave the Senate under the shadow of gender-abuse scandals.</p> \n\n<p>In sharp contrast, the Republican responses to scandal leave us uncertain who we really are.. Despite Roy Moore&#8217;s reputation as a pedophile, his Senate candidacy was backed by Trump and the Republican National Committee. Moore&#8217;s ambiguous denial of the charges (&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember&#8230; dating any girl without the permission of her mother.&#8221;) was supposed to exonerate him.&amp;#160; Most Republicans in Congress (as well as the White House) demonstrated their readiness to jettison their vaunted principles to get one more yes vote (for a bill that, along with&amp;#160; other cruelties, hurts women.)</p> \n\n<p>As with Moore, so Trump: &amp;#160;most Republicans appear deaf, dumb, and blind to the president&#8217;s predatory past, his use of office for his own profit-making, his peculiar links to Putin&#8217;s Russia, his attacks on the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community, and his various trespasses against the Constitution.</p> \n\n<p>What explains Republican apathy to amoral or, rather, immoral behavior in high places? Is age a factor?&amp;#160; Trump is 71; Moore, 70; The average age in the House is now 58 and the Senate 62.&amp;#160; Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is 75; senior Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer, &amp;#160;67. (Speaker of House Paul Ryan is a spring chicken at 47.). Have older men abandoned their ideals&#8212;or has hypocrisy always ruled the day?</p> \n\n<p>On the other hand, the distaff side of Congress is not resigned to male bullying. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (herself age 77) and many of the 89 women in the House and 21 in the Senate do care. Pelosi is one of many women who pressured Conyers and Franken to resign.</p> \n\n<p>Republican attitudes toward gender abuse is part of a larger indifference to basic morality and to patriotic love of country. Here is their version of the Ten Commandments (quite different from the one Judge Moore claimed to revere):&amp;#160; Greed more than age would explain this syndrome.</p> \n\n<p>+ Jigger the tax system to reward donors to our party regardless the impact on national debt and collateral damage to health, welfare, and education. Subvert comprehensive medicine by removing any obligation to buy health insurance. Remove tax exemptions for graduate student tuition grants and university endowments, because most educated people oppose our policies. We don&#8217;t need experts to guide policy but Trump loyalists</p> \n\n<p>+ Gut any restrictions on oil, coal, gas, and chemical industries.&amp;#160; Tear down environmental protection rules that favor alternative energy or protect public lands and water&amp;#160; (How many votes can Navajos, Sioux, Eskimos, and polar bears muster?) Ignore and throttle science that warns about global warming, pollution, or perils of nuclear war..</p> \n\n<p>+ Knowledge: Denounce mainstream media as &#8220;fake news&#8221; because they often question our policies and the motives behind them. Tear down net neutrality and let the biggest companies rule the air waves. Remove Obama-era efforts to protect learners from for-profit colleges like the erstwhile Trump University. Support charter schools including the many that teach creationism and say nothing about pollution and global warming.</p> \n\n<p>+ Raise walls against immigration&#8212;especially by Muslims, blacks, and Latinos. Get rid of DACA protections.&amp;#160; Many of migrants, especially those with education, &amp;#160;will support our political foes.</p> \n\n<p>+ Back white supremacists and weaken &#8220;black lives matter&#8221; and other forms of protest by non-whites. Do not punish racist police actions or alt-right demonstrators.</p> \n\n<p>+ Question the patriotism and honesty of any courts that rule against us.&amp;#160; Appoint judges &amp;#160;who share our &#8220;values.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>+ Tear down consumer, investor, and work-place protections; let free enterprise and the market do their thing.</p> \n\n<p>+ &#8220;America First!&#8221;&#8212;material interests above &#8220;values.&#8221; &amp;#160;Downplay our traditional alliances with democracies and work with strong, if authoritarian, partners such as Saudi Arabia and Russia,&amp;#160; Downsize the State Department.&amp;#160; Diplomats are superfluous: it&#8217;s the president who makes policy.</p> \n\n<p>+ Degrade arms control restraints and transfer at least one trillion dollars to industry to modernize our strategic and other arms.

To use it to describe acts of prejudice is to cede much of a hotly contested epistemic field to those only too happy to make the discussion entirely about speech rights rather than material harm.</p> \n\n<p>Loathsome as such arguments are, they do contain a basic truth: there is no way to guarantee that one will never be offended, and individual offense ought not be the yardstick by which we measure civil rights and liberties. But then, virtually no one on the feminist or anti-racist Left has been calling for that in the first place. When we discuss being &#8220;offended&#8221; we are, more often than not, talking about people being hurt in material ways.</p> \n\n<p>This is not to dismiss the importance of emotion, of course. There is a parallel problem with our culture worshipping at wanton offensiveness&#8217; bonfire, which is that it can coarsen our discourse and cheapen the currency of offensiveness itself during those times when its barbs need to cut most deeply (such as when one is offending those in power). To acknowledge that it is impossible and even undesirable to control everyone&#8217;s feelings is not the same as arguing that offense is harmless, or that it should be done for its own sake, or that every offensive word and deed should be celebrated as some grand strike for Enlightenment values. There remains something pathetically immature and irresponsible about such ideas.</p> \n\n<p>But we must distinguish this set of issues from the question of material harm. Being made to fear for your life is not the same as feeling hurt by speech. Losing your job as a result of stereotypes or harassment contained in speech is not the same as feeling personally offended by that speech. Being shot by the police because of ideas about your skin color transmitted through discourse is not the same as merely being offended by it. Being outed against your will is not the same as having your feelings hurt by it. It is the deeds that flow from words which concern us, and which cannot be contained by the concept of offensiveness.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>***</p> \n\n<p>Part of the reason we are drowning in a discourse of offendedness has to do with the triumph of an individualist, un-structural reading of history in the wake of the 1960s civil rights movements which interpreted phenomena like racism as expressions of loud, individual derangement. To be a racist was to speak like Bull Connor, and thus in an offensive and hurtful register, rather than to be part of sustaining a system that gives those words power.</p> \n\n<p>This is why, as a whole society, we only condemn racism vociferously when an individual like Donald Sterling says the n-word out loud, while&amp;#160;Fox News can get away with &#8220;polite&#8221; race-baiting for ages because they studiously avoid &#8220;offensive&#8221; language. This ensures people apologize for &#8220;coarse language&#8221; rather than a hateful idea likely to cause violence. Similarly, in transphobic discourse, the T-word is often silent and therefore such speech is considered inherently less offensive and thus not prejudiced. This is the trap that orienting our discussion of oppression around &#8220;offense&#8221; leads us straight into.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Offense&#8221; discourse encourages every fallacious false-equivalence under the sun. The idea that calling a white person a &#8220;cracker&#8221; is racist stems from this discourse; if &#8220;offense&#8221; is your only yardstick for measuring prejudice, then yes, surely hurting feelings with that word is racist. But in the real world actual racism is not about hurt feelings. It&#8217;s about being incarcerated, harassed, strip-searched, stalked, murdered, denied career advancement or an education, or being at risk of the foregoing and then having someone rub in one&#8217;s face the slurs and stereotypes that animate it all. Against all this, the psychic paper cut&amp;#160;of &#8220;cracker&#8221; surely pales.</p> \n\n<p>We respond to prejudice in pointillist fashion: this individual said something that hurt this other individual; therefore &#8220;offense&#8221; is the best way to describe that harm. But the reality is that when we talk about something like, say, misgendering a trans woman or using her old name in public, what is happening in those situations transcends the individual offense felt by the woman in question. That is part of her experience of the event, and part of the harm, but it is not in itself a political matter. What is political, in no uncertain terms, is the way such words and ideas are the spearpoint of&amp;#160;violence against trans women, <a href=\"http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/06/03/watch-suspect-atlanta-beating-invokes-trans-panic-defense\" type=\"external\">used to justify it and all but ensure such crimes will be repeated</a>. That is what so many transphobes on the internet deliberately access when they employ transmisogynist hate speech, and that is what takes it above the level of mere offensiveness.&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">So many of our slain sisters</a> died hearing their murderers misgender them; those who survive could, for instance, tell tales of angry men throwing bottles at them shouting &#8220;that&#8217;s a man!&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>To speak of the offensiveness of the words alone does violence to understanding the full scope of what is actually happening in such cases and gives in to the inertia of abstract debate.</p> \n\n<p>***</p> \n\n<p>Last year in the wake of the Isla Vista shooting I wrote an essay entitled &#8220; <a href=\"http://rhrealitycheck.org/article/2014/05/28/words-become-bullets-elliot-rodger-patriarchal-id/\" type=\"external\">When Words Become Bullets</a>&#8221;&amp;#160;to demonstrate how echo-chamber discourse metastasizes into very physical violence. Hurt feelings were not the primary crime committed by Eliot Rodger&#8217;s words; it was how he&amp;#160;contributed to a culture of violent misogyny and racism that ultimately motivated him to take six lives that interested feminists. When we talk about the many excesses of online discourse, be it in online harassment, or in extremists like the men&#8217;s rights movement <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/a-man-is-making-bizarre-terrifying-youtube-videos-abou-1683221832\" type=\"external\">or GamerGate</a>, we are not primarily discussing how they hurt peoples&#8217; feelings and asking for protection from that offense.&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.bustle.com/articles/63466-im-brianna-wu-and-im-risking-my-life-standing-up-to-gamergate\" type=\"external\">We are discussing</a> how <a href=\"http://ohdeargodbees.tumblr.com/post/107838639074/august-never-ends\" type=\"external\">they destroy lives</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Words and ideas shape and justify inflicting harm on marginal others; just as they impel men like Rodger or Anders Bering Brevik to murder, they also serve to inspire and justify campaigns of online harassment that can drive people from their homes, impose difficult working conditions on them, force them from jobs or other sources of income, and open them and their families up to physical violence &#8212; be it from people threatening to kill them directly, or through deceiving the police into swatting their target. The prejudicial ideas that make all this justifiable to the masses of perpetrators are not merely &#8220;offensive,&#8221; though in their shallow ignorance and painful stupidity they are most certainly that. They are outright dangerous to people&#8217;s well being. Ignoring that is what allows, for instance, a cadre of angry young gamers to pretend <a href=\"http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/224400/Gamers_dont_have_to_be_your_audience_Gamers_are_over.php\" type=\"external\">&#8220;Gamers are Over&#8221;</a> is a parallel prejudice to the ongoing harassment of women, queer people, and allies in the gaming world.</p> \n\n<p>With that, let us retire &#8220;that&#8217;s offensive&#8221; from our discourse and start saying what we mean.</p>", "title": "\u201cI find this offensive\u201d: How \u201coffense\u201d discourse traps us into inaction", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://feministing.com/2015/02/12/i-find-this-offensive-how-offense-discourse-traps-us-into-inaction/", "published_at": "", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>InterContinental Hotels Group PLC said Thursday that it is working with nonprofit organization The Humane League on a plan to source 100% cage-free eggs throughout operations in the U.S., Canada and Europe.

Yes, I am predicting that <a href=\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2012/11/05/much-of-the-media-is-calling-the-presidential-race-for-barack-obama.html\" type=\"external\">Barack Obama will win</a>, but since I need to get a whole column out of this, let me build slowly and methodically toward the dramatic conclusion.</p> \n\n<p>First, let me start with this somewhat astonishing (I think) observation. The numbers I&#8217;m about to give you? I could have given you this exact same Electoral College prediction in June. Or March. Or January. Or probably even last year. For all the twists and turns, all the debates, all the news developments expected and unexpected, the basic math of this election hasn&#8217;t changed barely a whit to my eye. It was always close and still is. The electoral map always favored Obama and still does. It&#8217;s almost as if we could have had this election months ago, sparing the nation billions of dollars and a lot of agita.</p> \n\n<p>Another point I want to make before starting. It&#8217;s worth bearing in mind in several cases, as I show below, that Obama won by some pretty big margins in some important states in 2008, so he can afford drop-offs of 7 or 8 percent in some states, or at least 5 percent, and still win them. You might want to look back over some of those 2008 margins before you settle into your easy chair tonight.</p> \n\n<p>Now, I <a href=\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2012/11/03/the-states-that-matter.html\" type=\"external\">begin with the states</a> that are automatic Democratic states&#8212;states where neither candidate is even contesting matters. Those states add up to 201 electoral votes (yes, George Will, this includes Minnesota).</p> \n\n<p>Then let&#8217;s take three states that are being contested this time but have been voting Democratic at least since Bill Clinton. These are Pennsylvania (Democratic since 1992), Michigan (also since 1992), and Wisconsin (since 1988). Some Republicans are hoping to snare at least one of these states.</p> \n\n<p>Are these states really in play? Granting that nobody knows anything until the votes are counted, I&#8217;d have to say it&#8217;s highly unlikely. States that have been voting one way for nearly a generation could flip from this column to that. But generally speaking they do so only in a real wave election. This is not a wave election, or at least it certainly doesn&#8217;t feel and smell like it is. There is no strong momentum right now in one direction or the other. This race now is just two big lumbering dinosaurs pushing against each other.</p> \n\n<p>Now, if unemployment were still 9 percent and the most recent jobs number was 50,000, then I could totally see it. It would be a wave election, and that wave would sweep Obama away. There&#8217;s no question that these states will be a lot closer this time&#8212;in 2008, Obama won Michigan by more than 16 points, Wisconsin by around 14, and Pennsylvania by 10. We&#8217;re more likely looking at margins of less than half those. They may all be within five points. But it doesn&#8217;t smell like we&#8217;re in an election that actually shifts them.</p> \n\n<p>So put these two categories, the automatic and the pretty strong leaners, together. They lift Obama to 247.</p> \n\n<p>Romney&#8217;s automatic total is 191. Then I guess we throw him North Carolina. I actually don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s at all insane to think Obama could pull an upset there. All depends on turnout. But the Democratic Party in the state is in pretty weak condition right now. I&#8217;m being a tad generous here since many polls show this within the margin of error, but generous is the kind of guy I am, as you well know, so I&#8217;ll put Romney&#8217;s automatic plus lean total at 206.</p> \n\n<p>That leaves seven states that combine to 85 electoral votes: Florida (29), Ohio (18), Virginia (13), Colorado (9), Iowa (6), Nevada (6), and New Hampshire (4). These are where the game will be decided. From the math, you can see that Obama needs just 23 of these 85, while Romney needs 64 of them.</p> \n\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the easier ones. It appears from most of what I&#8217;m seeing that Nevada is banked in Obama&#8217;s column, and that Iowa is close to banked. So that gets Obama up to 259, just 11 electoral votes away.</p> \n\n<p>I will give Florida to Romney. It&#8217;s totally up in the air, I think, and could go either way. But until it&#8217;s proven otherwise, I say that the weight of most polls is probably pretty accurate, and the aggregate of Florida polls seems to me to lean very slightly toward Romney. So that gets him to 235. Four states to go.</p> \n\n<p>Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.</p> \n\n<p>A speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;ll toss New Hampshire into Obama&#8217;s column. It&#8217;s not so different from Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, except that it did go for George W. Bush in 2000. Again, I look at 2008 margins. Obama won it by 10 percent, so he has a cushion here as well. Polls suggests he should be able to eke out a win of three points or so. That&#8217;s four more EVs, or 263.</p> \n\n<p>We are left with Colorado, Virginia, and Ohio. I&#8217;m going to give Colorado to Romney by a very slim margin. Obama has tended to lead there, but I&#8217;m just going to do it, for two reasons. First, I think Colorado swing voters are probably a little more libertarian than Eastern swing voters, which means a few more Romney votes from them. Second, I just don&#8217;t think Obama has quite enough momentum that everything is going to tumble his way. That gets Romney to 244.</p> \n\n<p>And that&#8217;s where he stops. Obama takes Ohio and Virginia. In Ohio, I think he&#8217;s pretty clearly ahead. It&#8217;s what the polls say. Virginia is more mixed, but it&#8217;s my hunch.</p> \n\n<p>So: Obama 294, Romney 244. No Floridas, no hanging chads, no Supreme Courts. A lot of states will be close, but I think it will be clear enough. Popular vote will be Obama by maybe 1.8 percent, something a shade under 2 percent.</p> \n\n<p>Mind you I lowballed Obama in 2008, for whatever that&#8217;s worth. I didn&#8217;t give him North Carolina or Indiana, so I have a history of humility on these matters, you could say.</p> \n\n<p>You can watch my Guardian video of my 2008 prediction <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/nov/03/uselections2008-obama-mccain-electoral-tomasky\" type=\"external\">here</a>.

They struggled with them every day, they said, but they were intractable. We&#8217;d just have to live with the status quo, they warned, and woe be to those who tried to change it.</p> \n\n<p>They also told us that globalization is an irreversible trend, that it&#8217;s therefore impossible to rescue manufacturing jobs, that the economy and the world are in a certain order and that only the foolish or naive would seek to overturn it.</p> \n\n<p>Then Mr. Trump arrived on the scene.</p> \n\n<p>For a new hire who doesn&#8217;t start work for another six weeks, he has been a whirling dervish of decision-making, deal-making and status quo-busting.</p> \n\n<p>The man hasn&#8217;t even clocked in yet, and he&#8217;s already saving American jobs, reassuring allies, striking fear and anxiety in our enemies and standing for freedom and free enterprise.</p> \n\n<p>He began by leveraging the power of the presidency to negotiate a deal with Carrier to keep approximately 1,100 jobs in the United States rather than transfer them to Mexico as the company had planned. He and vice president-elect Mike Pence, who also serves as the governor of Indiana where the Carrier facility in question is located, offered a mix of state-based tax and other incentives to convince the company to retain the American workers.</p> \n\n<p>Criticism of the deal from the right (charges of interference in the free market) and from the left (charges of hypocrisy toward those who opposed President Obama&#8217;s economic interventions) were muted. And for good reason.</p> \n\n<p>To the working class, making America great again was always about restoring respect and validity to their lives and livelihoods. In striking the deal with Carrier to keep those jobs in the United States, Mr. Trump delivered on the core promise of his campaign: that he sees these hardworking Americans, hears them, respects them and will deliver for them. He has already demonstrated that he will put their interests on par with &#8212; or even ahead of &#8212; those of the rich, powerful and influential.</p> \n\n<p>They now believe that the soon-to-be most powerful person in the world is on their side.</p> \n\n<p>That is economic and political dynamite.</p> \n\n<p>In fact, a Morning Consult/Politico poll released this week shows just how big a win it was. A whopping 60 percent of voters said Mr. Trump&#8217;s intervention with Carrier made them view him more favorably. &#8220;Rarely do we see numbers that high when looking at how specific messages and events shape public opinion,&#8221; Kyle Dropp, Morning Consult co-founder and chief research officer, told Politico.</p> \n\n<p>Further, Mr. Trump&#8217;s favorability rose across party lines: four out of 10 Democrats said they now view him more favorably, as do 54 percent of independents. Even 32 percent of Hillary Clinton voters said the deal improved their view of Mr. Trump.</p> \n\n<p>More good news for Mr. Trump and his economic approach: 56 percent of voters said it&#8217;s appropriate for the president to negotiate directly with companies on a case-by-case basis, and 62 percent said they would approve of the president offering tax breaks and incentives to individual businesses if it means retaining American jobs.</p> \n\n<p>Less than a week after the Carrier pronouncement, Mr. Trump struck a deal of a different kind. After he met with the CEO of Japanese tech company SoftBank, the company announced that it will invest $50 billion in the United States, creating up to 50,000 new jobs. The dealmaker at work.</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Trump&#8217;s economic plan is designed to make the country more competitive by implementing policies that apply to all companies: cutting taxes, including the corporate tax rate, repealing and rolling back stifling regulations, including the biggest of them all, Obamacare and those clobbering the energy sector, renegotiating trade deals such as NAFTA, and killing off the nascent Trans-Pacific Partnership. Through Mr. Trump&#8217;s leadership and initiative, he&#8217;s already started resuscitating manufacturing and leveling the playing field by putting American workers first.</p> \n\n<p>No wonder Democrats are panicked. Mr. Trump is winning over the working class, perhaps permanently, by honoring their work enough to save their jobs &#8212; something politicians have constantly said was impossible to do.</p> \n\n<p>The intangible part of an economy is having people believe in that economy. Half of the president&#8217;s job is to advance a pro-growth economic agenda that creates real wealth and prosperity for the American worker.

The combined company has a portfolio of more than 500 beers, including seven of the top 10 global beer brands and 18 brands that generate more than $1 billion in retail sales.</p> \n\n<p>AB InBev is now the world's first truly global brewer with operations in virtually every major beer market. And while growth in beer consumption has recently been sluggish in developed markets such as the U.S., the merger with SABMiller gives AB InBev a stronger position in high-growth developing regions, particularly in Africa.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>AB In Bev has also been <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/04/16/anheuser-busch-inbev-sa-shows-a-growing-appetite-f.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">snatching up craft beer brands Opens a New Window.</a> to expand its presence in this fast-growing segment of the massive U.S. market. Although this is still a small portion of its business, it makes the craft beer craze less of a threat than the bears would have you believe. In fact, higher-priced craft beer has made it easier for AB InBev to raise prices for its popular macrobrews, which has helped the company's revenue growth outstrip volume growth in recent years.</p> \n\n<p>But where the beer king really excels is in wringing profits out of each beer it sells. 3G Capital -- the Brazilian group that runs AB InBev -- has a strong track record of helping acquired businesses slash costs and boost profits, and investors should expect more of the same in the coming years. In fact, in its <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/03/02/anheuser-busch-inbev-polishes-off-a-tough.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">fourth-quarter earnings release Opens a New Window.</a>, management increased its guidance for synergies and cost savings related to the SABMiller merger to $2.8 billion, up from previous estimates of $2.45 billion. The company has already delivered on more than $800 million of that goal, and it expects to realize the remaining $2 billion over the next three to four years.</p> \n\n<p>During that time, management will be (wisely) prioritizing debt repayment, so AB InBev's dividend increases may be modest for the next few years. But its current yield is already sizable, at 3.6%, and the dividend should be well secured by the more than $20 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) the company expects to achieve once SABMiller is fully integrated.</p> \n\n<p>Even better, with its shares <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/02/19/after-falling-20-ab-inbev-is-a-fantastic-buy-for-s.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">down about 20% Opens a New Window.</a> from their 52-week highs due largely to some macroeconomic related -- and likely short-term -- struggles in Brazil, AB InBev's stock is currently trading at about 24 times analysts' earnings estimates for 2017 and 21 times 2018's estimates. That's quite a bargain for such a dominant company that's expected to grow earnings by more than 24% over the next half decade. As such, investors may wish to consider taking a sip of AB In-Bev stock today.</p> \n\n<p>Like AB InBev, Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) offers investors the potential for solid income generation and capital appreciation. The telecom giant's subscription-based, utility-like business generates strong and stable cash flow that it's then able to pass on to shareholders in the form of a steadily rising -- and currently 4.7% -- cash dividend stream.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://ycharts.com/companies/VZ\" type=\"external\">VZ</a> data by <a href=\"http://ycharts.com\" type=\"external\">YCharts Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Verizon's wireless network consistently <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/12/09/verizon-rootmetrics-lead-2016/\" type=\"external\">ranks Opens a New Window.</a> as the best in the industry, even as rivals such as T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE: S) claim that they're chipping away at Verizon's lead.

The company announced an unlimited data plan that's likely to prove popular with consumers and that could win some customers away from its rivals. At the very least, it should help to preserve Verizon's high customer retention.</p> \n\n<p>Verizon is also making moves to diversify its revenue streams. One exciting area of focus is the Internet of Things space, where Verizon is <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/11/27/verizon-is-transforming-itself-into-an-iot-and-med.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">acquiring assets Opens a New Window.</a> to strengthen its technology and service offerings. The company's IoT ambitions appear promising, with revenue growth from Verizon's IoT services rising 21% year over year on a comparable basis -- and 60% when including acquisitions -- to $243 million in the fourth quarter. Although the business is currently small (by Verizon's standards), the <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/12/12/our-3-favorite-stocks-to-invest-in-the-internet-of.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">massive potential Opens a New Window.</a> of the Internet of Things could help this segment grow to become a significant portion of Verizon's revenue and profits in the years ahead.</p> \n\n<p>Verizon is also rumored to be considering beefing up its pay-TV assets. Cable giant Charter Communications (NASDAQ: CHTR) is one company that's rumored to be a <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/01/31/comcast-shouldnt-fear-a-verizon-charter-merger.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">potential acquisition target Opens a New Window.</a>, but I'd rather see Verizon snatch up Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH). With a market cap of less than $30 billion (compared to nearly $87 billion for Charter), Dish would be much less expensive and likely easier to integrate. Dish's popular <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/12/19/is-sling-worth-20-a-month.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Sling TV product Opens a New Window.</a> is a gem that could help Verizon advance its beachhead in the rapidly growing Internet TV market and expand its popular \" <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/10/26/verizon-would-rather-sell-you-a-skinny-bundle-than.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">skinny bundle Opens a New Window.</a>\" offerings. Moreover, obtaining Dish Network's <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/02/04/3-reasons-dish-network-is-buying-up-wireless-spect.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">valuable spectrum Opens a New Window.</a> as part of the deal would be an added sweetener for Verizon.</p> \n\n<p>Regardless of whether any of these rumored acquisitions come to fruition, Verizon's core wireless business -- and more than $40 billion in annual EBITDA -- should allow the telecom titan to continue to do what it has done consistently over the past decade: reward its shareholders with steadily growing dividend income. And with its stock trading at only about 12 times forward earnings -- a significant discount to the S&amp;amp;P 500's forward P/E of 18 -- investors can buy this dividend dynamo at a fantastic price today.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than Verizon CommunicationsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That's been the story for Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ: WFM) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT), both of which have had to deal with changing trends in their respective industry niches that have threatened their once-dominant business models. Whole Foods has faced increased competition in organic and natural foods as its competitive advantage has proven to be fragile, while Wal-Mart has had to deal with rising costs and online competition that have hampered its ability to offer the lowest prices possible. Value-oriented investors see opportunities in both stocks, but they want to know which one looks better right now. Below, we'll compare Whole Foods and Wal-Mart using a number of metrics designed to reveal which is the more attractive stock right now.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Neither Whole Foods nor Wal-Mart has produced huge returns recently, but Wal-Mart has done slightly better. The big-box department store has given investors a 9% total return since February 2016, compared to just 3% for the natural and organic grocer during the same period.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Wal-Mart.</p> \n\n<p>Yet even though Whole Foods hasn't done as well lately, investors still give it a much higher valuation than they give Wal-Mart. Looking at trailing earnings, Whole Foods stock trades at 22 times what the grocer has brought in on the bottom line over the past 12 months. Wal-Mart carries a lower trailing earnings multiple of just 15. Moreover, given the relatively downbeat expectations for future earnings growth from the two companies, looking at forward-earnings-based metrics doesn't change the picture much. Wal-Mart still has the lead with a forward multiple of 16 compared to Whole Foods' 23. On valuation, Wal-Mart ends up the winner.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Wal-Mart also has the more impressive record on the dividend front. In terms of current dividend yield, Wal-Mart has a lead of a full percentage point, weighing in at 2.8% compared to Whole Foods' 1.8%.</p> \n\n<p>Wal-Mart has demonstrated a greater commitment to dividends and payout growth over its long history. For 44 straight years, Wal-Mart has increased the annual amount it pays in dividends to its shareholders, with its most recent 2% boost coming earlier this month. The pace of Wal-Mart's dividend increases has slowed in recent years, but the payout has still almost doubled since 2009.</p> \n\n<p>By contrast, Whole Foods has been less reliable with its dividends. The company suspended payouts from mid-2008 to 2010, and increases have been relatively modest, including a $0.005 per share rise in January to $0.14 per share quarterly. Whole Foods simply hasn't been as clear as Wal-Mart has about its commitment to dividends and the importance they have to investors.</p> \n\n<p>Both Wal-Mart and Whole Foods have struggled, but both are trying to bounce back. In its most recent quarter, Wal-Mart managed to post sales growth of 1%, even though net income fell by more than a sixth from year-ago levels. Comparable sales in its U.S. stores climbed 1.8%, with traffic growth accounting for most of the rise, and Wal-Mart's efforts to boost its online presence paid off with a 29% jump in e-commerce sales domestically. The retailer's guidance for the coming year was conservative, with expected revenue growth of 2% to 3% and more or less flat earnings per share compared to the just-completed fiscal year. Yet as Wal-Mart keeps aiming on the online retail space and works at managing its extensive inventory more effectively, investors hope that the retail giant will find ways to use its size and experience to woo shoppers both to its stores and to its mobile app and online portal.</p> \n\n<p>Meanwhile, Whole Foods is still trying to figure out where the bottom of its recent downturn might be. In its most recent quarter, the grocer posted a 2% rise in revenue, but comparable-store sales dropped by 2.4% as traffic fell sharply. Whole Foods had to admit that it would see negative comps throughout the fiscal year, and it now thinks sales growth overall could be as little as 1.5%. The company is closing underperforming stores, and even though it's trying to refocus on its best customers, Whole Foods has conceded that it no longer believes that its store network will grow to the 1,200 mark that the company used to pursue. Early results from the 365 store concept, which features more attractive price points for certain shoppers, haven't proven to be the panacea that some investors had hoped to see. For investors, the future remains uncertain for Whole Foods, and more patience will be required to see where the store ends up.</p> \n\n<p>Wal-Mart looks like the better buy right now on all fronts. With a more attractive dividend, cheaper valuation, and clearer growth prospects, Wal-Mart should retain an edge over Whole Foods until the natural and organic specialist figures out how to bounce back from its huge setbacks recently.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Suddenly, with all trains at a standstill, the railway system was under the control of the American Railroad Union, then led by Eugene V. Debs.</p> \n\n<p>President Cleveland conveniently invoked the executive responsibility to deliver mail to claim the strike was illegal and unjustified because the US Postal Service relied on train travel. He mustered a heavily armed force of more than 14,000 US Marshals, soldiers, and mercenaries to break the strike. After days of fighting and more than 30 workers killed, the strikers were dispersed and trains began to move.</p> \n\n<p>The Pullman Strike was one of the most catalyzing moments in American history, leading working people all over the country to draw revolutionary conclusions &#8212; including Debs, who read Marx for the first time while imprisoned for his role in organizing the strike.</p> \n\n<p>Cleveland was wary of the response to his actions. He signed Labor Day into law a mere six days after busting the strike.</p> \n\n<p>Convincing American workers to accept such a transparently disingenuous maneuver was a hard sell. But Cleveland found an effective ally in Samuel Gompers, the president of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), a conservative coalition of skilled workers that had opposed the strike.</p> \n\n<p>Gompers immediately endorsed the president&#8217;s holiday &#8212; Cleveland even presented him with the pen used to sign the holiday in law. Gompers later wrote a superlative column in the New York Times praising Labor Day as the harbinger of &#8220;a new epoch in the annals of human history.&#8221; He made the absurd claim that Labor Day &#8220;differs essentially from some of the other holidays of the year in that it glorifies no armed conflicts or battles of man&#8217;s prowess over man,&#8221; and wrote scathingly about the &#8220;dark side of the labor movement&#8221; represented by the Pullman strikers.</p> \n\n<p>Although previous Septembers had seen small workers celebrations in many states observing the end of summer, the first federally protected Labor Day was marked in 1894 with an AFL-supported parade.</p> \n\n<p>Debs still sat in jail with seventy-one others arrested during the Pullman action. Around the same time, the American Railway Union &#8212; previously the most powerful union in the country &#8212; was forcibly disbanded after the AFL denied its appeal.</p> \n\n<p>Labor Day marks our historic defeat, not our triumph.</p> \n\n<p>May Day celebrates the historic power of the working class to oppose its oppression and fundamentally alter society. Though it&#8217;s a welcome break from work for many of us, Labor Day is just another legacy of worker defeat.</p> \n\n<p>Read the rest <a href=\"https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/09/labor-day-may-first-american-labor-movement-haymarket/\" type=\"external\">here</a>.</p> \n\n<p>&#8211;Posted by <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Roisin Davis</a></p>", "title": "Why the Real Labor Day Is May 1", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/why-the-real-labor-day-is-may-1/", "published_at": "2015-09-07", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>I missed <a href=\"http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/about/newsroom/pressrelease/pr06092005_appropriations.cfm\" type=\"external\">this</a> when it popped up last week, but it deserves, even in retrospect, a resounding &#8220;What the f&#8212;?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Today [June 9th], 11 anti-choice Republican members of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees spending for health, labor and education programs voted against a proposal offered by Rep. David Obey (D-WI) aimed at making it economically easier for low-income and vulnerable women to choose to carry pregnancies to term.</p> \n\n<p>I never thought the obvious needed to be stated, but apparently so. Rep. Obey&#8217;s measure would have, in all certainty, reduced the number of abortions in America by making it easier for women to carry their pregnancies to term. No matter what delusions Republicans seem to be laboring under, many women abort not because they&#8217;re frivolous people or don&#8217;t respect the &#8220;culture of life,&#8221; but because they respect it all too well, and understand that it&#8217;s cruel to bring a child into the world that can&#8217;t be provided for properly. That&#8217;s not a difficult concept to grasp. Or it shouldn&#8217;t be. But really, what&#8217;s the use arguing here? These House Republicans don&#8217;t care.

Recently, though, railroad stocks have rebounded, and Union Pacific saw its stock climb above the $100-per-share mark last month for the first time since mid-2015. Some investors automatically think that a company will consider a stock split when its share price climbs into triple digits, and so it's natural to wonder whether Union Pacific will be splitting its stock soon. Below, we'll look more closely at Union Pacific's stock split history to try to get some hints about whether another split is likely to come.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Union Pacific has done several stock splits during its history, as you can see below:</p> \n\n<p>Data source: Union Pacific investor relations.</p> \n\n<p>Ordinarily, stock splits before the 1970s are hard to analyze, because price information is hard to retrieve. In Union Pacific's case, however, the company actually provides its own pricing data, and that is helpful in assessing what motivated the railroad company to do stock splits.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Union Pacific has changed the way it assesses stock splits throughout its history. Early on, the company allowed its stock price to climb well above levels that prompted many of its peers in the stock market to do stock splits. In 1948, the stock price was $190 per share before the stock split took effect, and the 1956 split occurred with the share price at about $172.50. The big 5-for-1 split in 1956 gave Union Pacific plenty of room for growth without needing to consider further splits for a couple of decades.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Union Pacific.</p> \n\n<p>By the 1970s, however, Union Pacific had adopted a more conventional approach to stock splits. The 1977 move happened with the stock at $97 per share, preventing the company's shares from reaching sustained triple-digit levels. The railroad was even faster on the draw in 1980, splitting with the stock at around $75 per share, and the 1991 split involved shares at prices between $94 and $95. Based on that part of its history, it would be natural to think Union Pacific might consider a split now.</p> \n\n<p>However, within the last decade, Union Pacific has reverted to its former strategy of allowing its stock to climb well past the $100-per-share mark before doing splits. In May 2008, Union Pacific traded at almost $160 at its high, and it had been above $100 per share throughout 2007 and early 2008 before the railroad made its move. After that, the financial crisis hit, sending Union Pacific's stock down sharply and taking several years to recover.</p> \n\n<p>Yet by late 2011, Union Pacific was once again trading in triple digits. The railroad waited two-and-a-half years before splitting, letting the stock hit the $200 per share mark before doing the split.</p> \n\n<p>It therefore seems very unlikely that Union Pacific will split again in the near future. It's only because of the downturn in the railroad industry that the stock fell back below the $100 per share mark at all immediately follow the previous split. That indicates that the railroad is comfortable with a triple-digit share price, or else it would have chosen a different split ratio than 2-for-1.</p> \n\n<p>Given that Union Pacific did its last split just over two years ago, there's no reason for investors to think that the company will be in a hurry to do another one. It will likely take another 50% to 100% move higher for Union Pacific share prices from current levels to justify the next split for the railroad's stock.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than Union Pacific When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The extended low-rate environment also benefited smaller companies that have taken on cheap debt in their balance sheets.</p> \n\n<p>Looking ahead, small-caps can still navigate through a slowly rising rate environment. Smaller companies, which cater toward U.S. domestic markets, are less exposed to a stronger U.S. dollar as rates rise, which would more negatively weigh on large-caps with a global footprint. Additionally, periods of rising rates also coincide with expanding economies, which often benefit smaller companies.</p> \n\n<p>The lower reliance on multinational sales has also supported mid-caps. Additionally, the mid-cap segment has provided favorable acquisition targets when cash-heavy large-cap companies are shopping around.</p> \n\n<p>Moreover, middle-capitalization stocks may offer a suitable middle ground between more volatile small-caps and less mobile large-caps. Mid-cap companies are slightly more diversified than their small-cap peers, which allows many of the companies to generate more consistent revenue and cash flow and provide more stable stock prices. Additionally, they are not so big that their size would slow down growth. Consequently, mid-caps have generated historically higher returns than large-caps, with higher volatility and higher beta, but at a lower ratio of return-to-risk than small-caps.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Among the best recent small-cap performers, the PowerShares Russell 2000 Equal Weight Portfolio (NYSE: <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.etftrends.com_etf-2Dresume.php-3Fquote-3Deqws&amp;amp;d=DQMFAg&amp;amp;c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&amp;amp;r=GRqff5l5MHpejHoKHot8Gp2SY_ZPxrunht950uhDnYCPYyIIU0YyzTG5vMXJEgC6&amp;amp;m=5SCG5s-hoQmDUcH1v_SdwLjILB-vT9ErXN_FsS9myoI&amp;amp;s=RSPbdrwkHUUrj2Pb9u5W5HJxMB0XxgACw5l-FzdZ9XI&amp;amp;e=\" type=\"external\">EQWS Opens a New Window.</a>) increased 3.6% and Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.etftrends.com_etf-2Dresume.php-3Fquote-3Dscha&amp;amp;d=DQMFAg&amp;amp;c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&amp;amp;r=GRqff5l5MHpejHoKHot8Gp2SY_ZPxrunht950uhDnYCPYyIIU0YyzTG5vMXJEgC6&amp;amp;m=5SCG5s-hoQmDUcH1v_SdwLjILB-vT9ErXN_FsS9myoI&amp;amp;s=BmXott4iSl2ujCXdekmrBB3C532pxUm_B0RnTmqJ920&amp;amp;e=\" type=\"external\">SCHA Opens a New Window.</a>) rose 2.8%.</p> \n\n<p>EQWS takes an equal-weight position on the Russell 2000.

Today, he got some bad news. The head of Purple PAC, one of three super-PACs devoted to supporting his candidacy, told Politico that he was holding off on spending any more money for Paul&#8217;s election until the Kentucky senator&#8217;s campaign &#8220;corrects its problems.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Purple PAC was established by former Cato Institute head Ed Crane two years ago to generally support libertarian candidates. But after raising $1.2 million in the first half of this year, Crane <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2015/07/27/libertarian-donors-put-up-6-million-for-rand-paul-gop-bid\" type=\"external\">announced</a> the super-PAC was all in for Paul. The super-PAC&#8217;s website changed its motif and still features a heavily pro-Paul message. But on Tuesday, Crane <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/rand-paul-superpac-purplepac-dark-214221\" type=\"external\">told Politico</a> that as long as the campaign continues to languish in the polls without a more resonant message, he&#8217;s not going to spend or raise any money on Paul&#8217;s behalf.</p> \n\n<p>The libertarian views that catapulted Paul to national prominence had &#8220;disappeared,&#8221; Crane said, leaving many of Paul&#8217;s longtime backers miffed.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I want to grab Rand by the lapels and say, &#8216;What are you doing?'&#8221; Crane said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan of Rand Paul. But whatever motivates his campaign, I don&#8217;t get it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In an email to Mother Jones, Crane said, &#8220;I still support Rand. We&#8217;ve stopped raising money until Rand starts emphasizing his libertarian positions, e.g., NSA, a more rational approach to Middle East, which we expect him to do.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Earlier this year, one Purple PAC contributor told Mother Jones that donors trusted Crane to make calls about supporting candidates, and it&#8217;s not clear how much of the decision to cease fundraising for Paul is driven by the donors. Crane&#8217;s outfit has relied heavily on one particular donor&#8212;Jeffrey Yass, the founder of investment firm Susquehenna International Group&#8212;who has also donated generously to the other pro-Paul super-PACs and is the largest single donor backing Paul&#8217;s candidacy. If Yass has soured on Paul, that raises questions about the candidate&#8217;s ability to continue in the race.</p> \n\n<p>Yass, who did not respond to a request for comment, donated $1 million of the nearly $1.2 million raised by Purple PAC this year. He also donated $1 million to America&#8217;s Liberty PAC, a super-PAC specifically endorsed by Paul. His contribution forms one-third of that PAC&#8217;s total fundraising haul. A third pro-Paul PAC, Concerned American Voters, has raised $1.8 million, of which Yass has kicked in $250,000. Combined, Yass has given more than $2.2 million, or roughly one-third of the total raised by pro-Paul super PACs.</p> \n\n<p>A Paul aide brushed off the news that Purple PAC was suspending its support for the Kentucky senator: &#8220;This PAC, as far as I can tell, has spent no money&#8212;zero&#8212;in support of Rand. For this and other reasons, this won&#8217;t impact Rand at all.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The only activity the PAC seems to have taken so far is promoting a contest <a href=\"http://purplepac.org/contest/\" type=\"external\">offering $10,000 in prizes</a> for the five best ideas on how to promote Paul.

This subject has gained great prominence in public debate in the United States and elsewhere in recent years, abetted by the Piketty phenomenon and subsequently by Bernie Sanders&#8217;s focus on the issue in his electrifying (although doomed) presidential campaign challenge to the status quo.</p> \n\n<p>The success of Thomas Piketty&#8217;s Capital in the Twenty-First Century was surely due in part to one of the three related changes noted in Milanovic&#8217;s important new book: the stagnation of incomes among the middle classes of the developed world. The carefully collated data for the years 1988 to 2011 that form the evidence on which Global Inequality is based reveal that members of this group&#8212;not the richest 10 percent of the world population but the next tenth down&#8212;remain well off in global terms. But they have seen smaller (almost non-existent) income gains compared to any other group in the world, and they are described by Milanovic on Twitter as the &#8220;decile of discontent.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Milanovic notes two other momentous changes: the rise of a &#8220;global middle class,&#8221; most of them urban dwellers in China and other Asian countries, although with some in Latin America and Africa; and the emergence of a global plutocracy, the infamous 1 percent. Global Inequality argues that these trends have causes and consequences related to the interplay of economics and politics. In contrast to Piketty&#8217;s explanation&#8212;the famous technical expression r &amp;gt; g, which in plain English means a return to capital greater than the economic growth rate&#8212;Milanovic&#8217;s argument is a richer and more plausible account of changes in inequality as the outcome of political and social dynamics.</p> \n\n<p>This richness of analysis means Milanovic does not propose easy fixes for the disturbing degree of inequality, but neither does he see the present trends as inevitable. While observing that the twentieth century was the only time in history when inequality diminished as average incomes rose, he argues that political choices over taxation, education, and capital ownership could achieve the same again. The unspoken conclusion is that if politics does not distribute the gains of economic growth more fairly, the consequences could be dire.</p> \n\n<p>Milanovic argues that, within their own borders, countries follow cycles of the narrowing and widening of income distribution. He has a term for this dynamic: &#8220;Kuznets waves,&#8221; named after the pioneer of this kind of analysis, the American economist Simon Kuznets. In his work in the 1950s, Kuznets suggested that distribution followed a hump-shaped pattern: Inequality increased as countries moved from poor to middle income, reflecting the early success stories of economic development, and decreased as they progressed to developed status, when progressive taxation started to fund education and social transfers for the masses. This was an empirically robust observation until the late 1980s, when inequality started increasing once again in rich countries like the United States.</p> \n\n<p>Milanovic&#8217;s new Kuznets waves incorporate the same drivers of change in inequality, but he distinguishes between stagnant and growing economies, giving several historical examples. In stagnant economies&#8212;say, Europe before the Industrial Revolution or some poor countries now&#8212;inequality cycles up and down depending on the mortality of the population (and hence size of the labor force) and events such as wars or the discovery of resources. On average, life remains miserable.On the other hand, in economies that escape the poverty trap and have rising average incomes, higher inequality is made possible simply because there is more headroom, so incomes at the top can grow over time without causing starvation at the bottom. This occurred in economies like the United States and the UK in the nineteenth century and is occurring again today. New technologies reward small groups of skilled workers, reinforced by pro-rich policies enacted by governments, as those who benefit learn to leverage their economic power into political action.</p> \n\n<p>But in the historical examples, two mechanisms have kicked in, tending to reduce inequality within growing economies. One is the original, &#8220;benign&#8221; Kuznets mechanism of tax-funded provision of public goods and redistribution, education that increases the supply of relevant skills, and political participation. Another is Piketty&#8217;s &#8220;malign&#8221; mechanism of war, which reduces inequality; it levels down by destroying property, harming more those who have the most assets to lose (he was referring only to the big European wars). In contrast to Piketty, Milanovic sees war as a potential consequence of great inequality, as part of the dynamic rather than an external lightning bolt. &#8220;Rising inequality indeed sets in motion forces, often of a destructive nature, that ultimately lead to its decrease but in the process destroy much else,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;A very high inequality eventually becomes unsustainable, but it does not go down by itself; rather, it generates processes, like wars or social revolutions, that lower it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>What does the Kuznets wave mechanism imply for the present? After setting out the recent changes in the global inequality data, the book considers in turn the trends in inequality both within and between countries.</p> \n\n<p>Prior to 1988 there had been a significant reversal in the determinants of an individual&#8217;s position in the global income distribution. In the early nineteenth century, this ranking depended on class: 80 percent of global inequality was explained by differences between rich and poor within countries. By the mid-twentieth century, 80 percent of the global income gap depended on income differences between countries. Milanovic attributes this switch to colonialism: Exploitation enabled the wages of workers in colonial powers to rise. The &#8220;country premium&#8221; on incomes probably peaked around 1970.</p> \n\n<p>Yet class has been returning as an explanatory factor. Thanks to the catch-up by some Asian economies, especially China, inequality between countries has narrowed, while inequality within countries has widened since 1988.</p> \n\n<p>Still, he writes: &#8220;The world where location has the most influence on one&#8217;s lifetime income is still the world we live in.&#8221; And the premium is huge. Compared to the poorest country, Congo, the premium for being American is 9,200 percent, for Brazilians 1,300 percent, and even for Yemenis it&#8217;s 300 percent. The premium for a good location is also greater the lower you go down the income distribution, so one of the poorest American citizens is even more than 9,200 percent better off than the poorest Congolese.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>No wonder international migration seems to be heading inexorably upward. The book considers the implications of migration at some length, noting, &#8220;The pent-up demand for migration is many times the actual rate.&#8221; Milanovic cites estimates that perhaps 10 percent of the world&#8217;s population would like to migrate to another country, compared to the 3 percent of the world&#8217;s population who have already migrated to date. He suggests that, as there is little chance of reducing the flow, rich recipient countries need to manage the consequences for their own citizens and budgets, for example by adopting discriminatory policies such as guest worker programs or reduced legal protections for immigrants.</p> \n\n<p>The final chapters turn to the future of global inequality and some reflections on policy. Milanovic argues that even if emerging economies like China and Brazil see slower growth, they will continue to grow faster than the old West, and so their income catch-up will remain one of the contributors to global distributional trends. The overall global pattern will largely depend on what happens to inequality within the two biggest countries, China and the United States. Here, he is more cautious about forecasting. The original Kuznets pattern of wider access to education and opportunity would tend to reduce inequality within China, and on balance he suggests this will outweigh any effects of corruption or internal conflict and break-up.</p> \n\n<p>On the other hand, he portrays America as trapped in a &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; of rising inequality. Technological change and investment in automation will continue to increase the share of income going to owners of capital. The same people are likely to be also those most able to earn very high incomes. There is a pattern of the high-earning marrying the fellow high-earning, so inequality is further embedded between households. And&#8212;above all&#8212;the rich are continually reinforcing their political power and dismantling pro-poor policies such as progressive taxation and funding for public education and infrastructure. &#8220;It is hard to see where any forces might come from that could counter rising income inequality in the United States,&#8221; he concludes.</p> \n\n<p>And the book concludes with a yet more pessimistic turn. Milanovic argues that capitalism (an economy based on the profit motive and privately owned capital) will survive, but democracy might not. Democracy is being hollowed out along with the middle class. Populism is the political vehicle for this process, the function of the &#8220;culture war&#8221; being to &#8220;mask the real shift of economic power toward the rich.&#8221; There is a section in the final chapter titled, &#8220;How can inequality in rich welfare states be reduced?,&#8221; but it covers just six pages; Milanovic&#8217;s heart is not really in providing a list of practical measures to reduce inequality and save democracy. Indeed, he quotes Machiavelli&#8217;s Discourses on Livy at the start of the chapter:</p> \n\n<p>If you tender your advice with modesty and the opposition prevents its adoption and, owing to someone else&#8217;s advice being adopted, disaster follows, you will acquire very great glory. And although you cannot rejoice in the glory that comes from disaster which befalls your city or your prince, it at any rate counts for something.</p> \n\n<p>It is clear he is inclined to predict disaster, suspecting the world is in for the malign mechanisms redressing inequality to kick in. &#8220;The short twentieth century is the only sustained period in history when rising mean incomes have been accompanied by decreasing income inequality,&#8221; he writes. That does not augur too well for the twenty-first century, given that it took the cataclysms of the Great Depression and World War II to create the conditions for post-war redistributive policies. At present there is little evidence of a political consensus for pro-equality policies, for all the surprising success of populists like Bernie Sanders.</p> \n\n<p>But there is a paradox in Milanovic&#8217;s pessimism, for he is arguing that in countries such as the United States and the U.K., the benign forces that reduce inequality are in reverse to such an extent that the malign political reaction of violent conflict might kick in; yet he also asserts that the Asian countries will continue their catch-up, so global inequality will continue its historic reduction. Good news is bad news. To pile on the paradox, the economic globalization that has enabled Asia&#8217;s rise is also driving migration to such a scale that it threatens to push the United States and Europe in a more xenophobic direction.</p> \n\n<p>The pessimism is tempting. Even though data for the United States and the U.K. suggest inequality of incomes in these two countries narrowed a bit after the financial crisis, the populism on the march on both sides of the Atlantic is certainly fed by rage against the elites. Great wealth looks like it has bought politics.</p> \n\n<p>There are two significant caveats to Milanovic&#8217;s argument about the near-inexorable forces driving inequality upward.</p> \n\n<p>One is the extent to which the malign trends are specifically American. Inequality certainly rose in most OECD countries after 1988, and it rose fastest in some of the more equal societies, such as Sweden. The forces of technology and globalization are global. However, politics is local. There are important differences among countries in their policy responses to inequality, and there will probably be different consequences. Some have fought harder than others to offset the divergence in market incomes with redistributive taxes and public spending or higher minimum wages.</p> \n\n<p>Indeed, taking the global income distribution as a whole, most of the people in the decile of discontent, the 10 percent of the world population whose incomes have not risen for the past 20 years, are from the bottom half of the income distribution in the United States, Germany, and to some extent Japan. Because America is so large, most of these individuals are Americans. And fully half the people in the global top 1 percent are American (with most of the rest from Western Europe, Japan, and Australasia&#8212;not the Russian and Chinese plutocrats who so easily leap to mind).</p> \n\n<p>Milanovic&#8217;s pessimism about the absence of any political correctives to inequality refers almost entirely to the United States. We Western Europeans have had a populist backlash too, but there are some signs that politicians are responding. The tough EU limits on bankers&#8217; bonuses, a large increase in the U.K. minimum wage, and the cooperation of most European nations on limiting the ability of multinationals to dodge taxes and generally behave like buccaneers rather than corporate citizens all count as evidence for this. It might be too little, too late, and the EU often seems to be in self-destruct mode in the face of slow growth and mass immigration, but there is something running counter to the malign mechanism of Milanovic&#8217;s Kuznets wave.</p> \n\n<p>The other caveat is that there may also be corrective economic forces to limit and ultimately reverse high income inequality. As Milanovic details, technological innovations are one of the drivers of growing inequality. Economists such as David Autor and co-authors Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz largely agree on the importance of digital technologies in raising the wage premium for the highly educated, in increasing the demand for low-skilled workers doing jobs the machines cannot, and in reducing employment and earnings in the kinds of routine jobs in the middle of the income distribution. The workers who held these jobs prior to the 1990s are the members of the decile of discontent.</p> \n\n<p>Millions of people have been automated out of their jobs many times in the past, and their prospects are always grim. No government has found a good way to help people who are technologically redundant. On the contrary, unemployment and poverty become embedded in formerly prosperous places such as America&#8217;s Rust Belt or Britain&#8217;s northern towns and cities. Yet other jobs are created, and ultimately well-paying ones too. The mechanism is the provision of education and training to replace redundant skills&#8212;made obsolete by machines&#8212;with new skills that complement the machinery. This takes a long time&#8212;a generation probably.</p> \n\n<p>But as a recent book, James Bessen&#8217;s Learning by Doing: The Real Connection Between Innovation, Wages, and Wealth, spells out in detail, this process has happened time and again with new technologies. He begins with the example of cotton in the Industrial Revolution. Skilled engineers who could install and maintain the new looms and spinning machines earned a high wage premium while the masses were immiserated. But over time the skills needed to work with the machinery were standardized and widely learned, along with time keeping and other disciplines of industrial work. Wages for the many then climbed. The same pattern has been observed with subsequent technological waves, and there is no reason not to expect it in the digital era.</p> \n\n<p>A generation is a long time to wait, and perhaps too long to avert the malign political reaction to inequality. So I wish Milanovic were not so halfhearted about faster policy responses. He advocates wider access to good education, and also wider ownership of financial assets, but he oozes doubt about whether these are politically feasible (who will campaign for higher inheritance taxes?) or if they would make much difference. There are other possibilities, though. Anthony Atkinson&#8217;s recent book, Inequality: What Can Be Done?, has a long list of suggestions&#8212;15, in fact, though they are specifically for the UK&#8212; and a discussion of their practicality. The ideas include stronger enforcement of anti-trust policy to reduce monopoly power&#8212;and earnings&#8212;in key sectors like finance; an increase in the minimum wage (already announced by the Conservative Chancellor George Osborne); a lifetime tax on capital receipts; and more progressivity in income tax.</p> \n\n<p>While any of these might seem impossible in the American political context, they are feasible-to-likely in Europe. Indeed, dysfunctional American politics pose the biggest hurdle across the Atlantic too, as some steps&#8212;for example, on multinational taxation or financial regulation and reward&#8212;require international agreement.</p> \n\n<p>I have no wish to be a Pollyanna about future political and economic prospects. Milanovic is surely right to point to the unsustainability of income inequality at current levels, and&#8212;as the unsustainable is never sustained&#8212;to worry therefore about what mechanisms will reduce it in the next Kuznets wave.</p> \n\n<p>The continuing, albeit slower, growth of China and other Asian countries means the West will continue in relative decline, the United States seemingly eager to be in the vanguard. Our middle class &#8220;decile of discontent&#8221; is paying the costs of adjusting to an economic structure based on the spread of digital technologies and automation. We should be thinking hard about how to assist the people affected (with citizen incomes, retraining, or guaranteed public jobs), about educating the next generation appropriately, and about ensuring the plutocrats are not allowed to float in their own sphere, utterly separate from their fellow citizens.</p> \n\n<p>As Milanovic concludes, &#8220;The gains from globalization will not be evenly distributed.&#8221; Nor will incomes stay so unequally distributed; but how exactly the reversal happens is up to all of us to determine.</p>", "title": "Everyone\u2019s Problem", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://democracyjournal.org/magazine/41/everyones-problem/", "published_at": "2016-06-20", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>&#8220;Political adviser Karl Rove and other high-ranking figures in the Bush White House played a greater role than previously understood in the firing of federal prosecutors almost three years ago, according to newly obtained e-mails that shed light on a scandal that led to mass Justice Department resignations and an ongoing criminal probe,&#8221; reports the Washington Post.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://politicalwire.com\" type=\"external\">[via Political Wire]</a></p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073002023.html?hpid=topnews\" type=\"external\">Link</a></p> \n\n<p />", "title": "New Light on Rove's Role in U.S. Attorney Scandal", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/new-light-on-roves-role-in-u-s-attorney-scandal/", "published_at": "2009-07-31", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Soldiers from Battery A, 1st Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery Regiment fired the howitzers on their M109A6 Paladins during the first-ever firing of the Modular Artillery Charge System in the combat zone by an entire Paladin battery March 13, 2011 on Camp Taji, Iraq.

Fuzzy math aside, what his foes fail to mention is that the stimulus, like all else these days, operated under the conservative creed that everything must be done through the private sector. This ethos, which Obama has <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2011/06/11/Obama-Private-sector-key-to-jobs-growth/UPI-37351307786400/\" type=\"external\">firmly embraced,</a> prevents the federal government from taking the far more efficient route of simply employing people, which might have created many more good jobs at the same cost.</p> \n\n<p>Had Obama had heeded FDR&#8217;s experience during the Great Depression, we could have put unemployed people to work rebuilding American infrastructure&#8212;bridges, tunnels, railroads, roads&#8212;not to mention restoring and shoring up wetlands and carrying out other environmental projects. That&#8217;s what <a href=\"http://unsilentgeneration.com/2010/01/27/2630/\" type=\"external\">Roosevelt&amp;#160;famously did</a>with his Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation&amp;#160;Corps.</p> \n\n<p>Such an initiative might have been possible, on some scale, prior to the midterm elections. But with the gridlock in Congress and diminishing confidence in the president and government, that course now is hard to imagine. Instead, the austerity imposed by the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">debt deal</a> will further impede any chance of real job growth&#8212;as <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2011-08-04/news/29850997_1_government-spending-job-growth-jobs-crisis\" type=\"external\">Roosevelt discovered</a> in 1937 when he briefly adopted austerity measures, only to see a falling unemployment rate spike once again.</p> \n\n<p>But even at this dismal stage, there remain a handful of realistic projects that ought to appeal to some fiscally minded conservatives, and Democrats as well.</p> \n\n<p>Jonathan Alter, a journalist and historian of FDR&#8217;s New Deal, is <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-22/a-smart-jobs-creation-idea-both-parties-can-love-jonathan-alter.html\" type=\"external\">promoting an idea</a> that would allow states to &#8220;convert their unemployment insurance payments from checks sent to the jobless into vouchers that can be used by companies to hire workers.&#8221; The amount of the checks would in effect become subsidies to the employers, so that &#8220;for instance, a position paying $40,000 might cost employers only $20,000, thereby encouraging them to hire&#8230;If a mere 10 percent of unemployed Americans persuaded employers to accept such vouchers, more than a million people would find work with no new spending beyond some administrative costs.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Alter thinks this plan, first suggested by Alan Khazei, a Democratic candidate for the Senate in Massachusetts, might appeal to &#8220;a Republican House that loves the concept of vouchers.&#8221; But so far there&#8217;s been no interest from Congress or the Obama administration.</p> \n\n<p>Another option is the already much-discussed German experience with short work weeks. As Kevin A. Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/article/101282\" type=\"external\">explained this scheme</a> back in 2009:</p> \n\n<p>Firms that face a temporary decrease in demand avoid shedding employees by cutting hours instead. If hours and wages are reduced by 10 percent or more, the government pays workers 60 percent of their lost salary. This encourages firms to use across-the-board reductions of hours instead of layoffs. Here&#8217;s how the program works.</p> \n\n<p>A firm facing the challenges of the recession cuts Angela&#8217;s hours from 35 to 25 per week, thus reducing her weekly salary to 714 euros from 1,000 euros. Angela does not work for the firm during those hours. As part of its short-work program, the government now pays Angela 171 euros&#8212;60 percent of her lost salary. Most important, she still has a job. Effectively, the government is giving her unemployment insurance for the 10 hours a week that she is not employed.</p> \n\n<p>Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) have put this program into legislation that so far has gone nowhere, with only a handful of cosponsors. This despite the fact, per <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/work-sharing-the-quick-route-back-to-full-employment\" type=\"external\">Dean Baker</a> of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, that &#8220;21 states (including California and New York) already have short-time compensation as an option under their unemployment insurance system. In these states, a governmental structure already exists to support work sharing, although there would have to be changes to make the system more user friendly so as to increase take-up rates.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In the Washington Post last week, Steven Pearlstein <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/steven-pearlstein-the-global-economy-comes-to-the-end-of-its-string/2011/08/04/gIQAa2zEvI_story.html\" type=\"external\">pointed to another way</a> of immediately putting people to work, which harkens back to the idea of rebuilding the nation&#8217;s crumbling infrastructure:</p> \n\n<p>Over the next decade, the federal government is slated to spend hundreds of billions of dollars building roads, schools, airports, trolley lines and airport terminals, modernizing the air traffic control system, replacing computer systems and buying planes, ships, tanks, trucks and cars. Moving up some of that spending from years 8, 9 and 10 to years 1, 2 and 3 won&#8217;t cost any more in the long run, or increase the long-term deficit any more, but could sure help put a floor under the economy in the short run. For those worried about pork, the actual spending decisions could be left to an independent Infrastructure Bank.</p> \n\n<p>To spur private investment in equipment and research, the government could immediately allow companies of all sizes to deduct 100 percent of such expenses made in the next three years, rather than &#8220;depreciating&#8221; them over many years. That incentive to invest now will increase the deficit in the short run but have little or no impact on the long-term deficit.</p> \n\n<p>As former MoJo reporter <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/how-can-washington-help-create-jobs/2011/08/03/gIQAz7JTsI_blog.html\" type=\"external\">Suzy Khimm writes</a> in the Post, &#8220;The question of infrastructure funding will come up as soon as Congress returns from its August recess,&#8221; since &#8220;a bill reauthorizing spending on surface transportation&#8212;which would help build roads, highways, and the like&#8212;is set to expire in September. There&#8217;s a big gap between the House GOP proposal, which would slash federal spending to 35 percent less than Fiscal 2009 levels, and Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer&#8217;s two-year plan to spend $55 billion a year. Boxer&#8217;s proposal would require revenue beyond what&#8217;s in the Highway Trust Fund, which receives money from the gas tax, promising yet another fight over which will be better for the economy&#8212;reducing the deficit or Keynesian spending on infrastructure.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>We all know how that fight is likely to turn out. And as Alter notes, even these modest approaches to job creation call for an attitude of what Roosevelt called &#8220;bold, persistent experimentation&#8221;&#8212;and the leadership to back it up.

And the corporate media&#8217;s coverage of it may only make it worse.</p> \n\n<p>For example, in one of his first public appearances, on CNBC&#8217;s morning show (Squawk Box, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/09/epa-chief-scott-pruitt.html\" type=\"external\">3/9/17</a>), Pruitt set an ominous precedent for the Trump administration&#8217;s climate change policy by outright lying. In response to host Joe Kernan&#8217;s question about the role of human-generated carbon dioxide in warming the planet, Pruitt responded:</p> \n\n<p>I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there&#8217;s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it&#8217;s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.</p> \n\n<p>Pruitt added: &#8220;We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Pruitt&#8217;s comments are, by now, recognized as among the standard rhetorical tools of climate deniers (Guardian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/sep/16/climate-change-contrarians-5-stages-denial\" type=\"external\">9/15/13</a>). He boldly mischaracterizes as &#8220;tremendous disagreement&#8221; what is, in fact, an <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/\" type=\"external\">overwhelming scientific consensus</a> about the link between humanity&#8217;s greenhouse gases and global warming. Then he disingenuously calls for more &#8220;debate&#8221; and &#8220;analysis&#8221; of the topic, while at the same time the Trump administration is proposing <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administration-seeks-big-budget-cuts-for-climate-research/\" type=\"external\">massive budget cuts</a> of the federal agencies that would conduct this research and analysis.</p> \n\n<p>That this White House would embrace climate change denial, of course, comes as no surprise. The current president has a well-documented history of promoting right-wing conspiracy theories about climate change, calling it on numerous occasions an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/408983789830815744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" type=\"external\">&#8220;expensive hoax&#8221;</a> that was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/265895292191248385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" type=\"external\">&#8220;created by the Chinese.&#8221;</a> During the 2016 campaign, Trump told a right-wing radio host, <a href=\"http://www.hughhewitt.com/donald-trump-returns/\" type=\"external\">&#8220;I&#8217;m not a big believer in man-made climate change,&#8221;</a> promising to abandon the landmark Paris Agreement on climate action President Obama signed in 2016. During the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlI5l41Hpww\" type=\"external\">first presidential debate</a>, Trump did deny having ever called climate change a hoax, but the public record obviously proves otherwise.</p> \n\n<p>Pruitt, a dogged opponent of the EPA while Oklahoma attorney general, is cut from the same climate denial cloth, minus the outrageous tweets. A trove of 6,000 emails released via court order by an Oklahoma judge last month (New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/us/politics/scott-pruitt-environmental-protection-agency.html\" type=\"external\">2/22/17</a>) revealed that Pruitt had colluded for years with oil and gas companies, as well as the Koch brothers&#8217; political arm, to lobby against EPA greenhouse gas regulations. He even &amp;#160;secretly used drafts of oil company talking points in his correspondence to the federal government.</p> \n\n<p>Nevertheless, the selection in December of a hard-right climate denier like Pruitt to run the agency <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reedfrich/status/806620055140270081\" type=\"external\">upset a phony media narrative</a> that had begun just a few weeks after the election. Thanks to a few <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/us/politics/donald-trump-visit.html\" type=\"external\">casual comments</a> by Trump to the Times editorial staff in November, much of the pundit class had convinced itself that the new president was pivoting to a more moderate position. The prospect of four more years of this same media credulity and deference to power does not bode well for future climate change coverage.</p> \n\n<p>CNBC&#8217;s Kernan, in his interview with Pruitt, provided a sneak preview of what this next four years of media obsequiousness may look like. Not satisfied with merely letting Pruitt lie unchallenged, Kernan felt compelled to back him up. &#8220;That&#8217;s the whole point of science, is to keep asking questions,&#8221; Kernan disingenuously added in his wrap-up. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be called a denier, it scares me. It&#8217;s a terrible thing. Administrator Pruitt, I know you don&#8217;t want to be called it either.&#8221; Before throwing the segment back to a studio host, Kernan didn&#8217;t give time for Pruitt to agree. Then again, why even bother?</p> \n\n<p>To be fair, CNBC is not a cable TV network known for its trenchant climate change reporting. And one can safely assume that Pruitt&#8217;s climate change denials on Fox News will be met with a &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; tongue bath likely to put Kernan&#8217;s to shame. But subtle changes in so-called straight reporting and coverage matter too. That&#8217;s why the online story ( <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/09/epa-chief-scott-pruitt.html\" type=\"external\">3/9/17</a>) accompanying Kernan&#8217;s interview is a better, more ominous barometer of how the corporate media might respond to the Trump administration&#8217;s climate policy.</p> \n\n<p>Overall, the CNBC article, by energy reporter Tom DiChristopher, sanded off almost all of Kernan&#8217;s overt sycophancy. However, the story still trafficked in classic <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">false equivalence</a>. When comparing Pruitt&#8217;s evidence-free claims to the vast amount of climate data and overwhelming scientific consensus supporting anthropogenic climate change, CNBC notably chose to characterize the latter as merely &#8220;the opinion&#8221; of NASA and NOAA: &#8220;Pruitt&#8217;s view is also <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-data-show-2016-warmest-year-on-record-globally\" type=\"external\">at odds with the opinion</a> of NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Recent history offers numerous examples of the corporate media succumbing to the temptation of parroting White House talking points, no matter how disconnected from reality. Recall that, for years, major news organizations, including the New York Times, felt compelled to echo the <a href=\"http://harpers.org/blog/2009/05/the-timess-torture-hypocrisy/\" type=\"external\">Bush administration&#8217;s &#8220;enhanced interrogation&#8221; euphemisms</a> for what had previously been recognized as acts of torture (Extra!, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">5&#8211;6/08</a>). Now that climate denialism has become de facto US policy, it will become almost impossible for journalists to both maintain traditional &#8220; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">objectivity</a>&#8221; while also reporting scientific reality to the public. They have a clear choice to make.</p> \n\n<p>As the long indictment of flawed climate change coverage by Robert Eshelman (CJR, <a href=\"http://archives.cjr.org/essay/the_danger_of_fair_and_balance.php\" type=\"external\">5/1/14</a>) can attest, corporate media have not always chosen wisely. Time and again, it has demonstrated that it can be successfully gamed by denialists operating little more than a propaganda campaign. Asks Eshelman in his insightful essay:</p> \n\n<p>Journalists&#8230;wouldn&#8217;t have provided &#8220;balance&#8221; to a debate on gravity, giving equal time to someone asserting that it doesn&#8217;t exist; why would they for climate change?</p> \n\n<p>But now that climate change lies have the imprimatur of the president of the United States, we may find that scientific facts and the fundamental laws of physics are subject to even more media distortion.</p> \n\n<p>Reed Richardson is a media critic and writer whose work has appeared in The Nation, AlterNet, Harvard University&#8217;s Nieman Reports and the textbook Media Ethics (Current Controversies).

Some time ago, he told relatives that for months he was being harrassed by his neighbors.</p> \n\n<p>On February 17, Marcelo went out with his mother to buy groceries, when two female neighbors started to hurl insults at him for being gay. He was defended by his mother, who then began to receive blows by the two women. Marcelo, who was trying to defend himself was intercepted by two men who started to kick him on the ground. The mother and son started to retreat from the scene. Unfortunately, this horrible story doesn't end here. Marcelo Vega, partner of the victim, states that one of the female aggressors started to yell, \"?Kill the damn faggot, kill the bastard.\"? At that moment, one of the aggressors, Juan Carlos Altamirana Mattus, shot him close to his neck, missed, and fired again, hitting him in the thorax. This was the bullet that led to Marcelo's death.</p> \n\n<p>The Santiago district attorney's office has detained Juan Carlos Altamirana, but the other three accomplices remain free.

At fifty-eight years old and after having published in October her fourteenth book, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Fledgling</a>, Butler had many more thrilling tales of reason and self-consciousness in her and she was getting better and better at it. The loss of her knocked me down and, while writing these words in her memory, it&#8217;s been hard to get up again.</p> \n\n<p>In many ways, Fledgling was a new departure: a &#8220;vampire&#8221; book that had returned her to the supreme pleasures of storytelling. I was in the audience at a &#8220;lecture&#8221; she gave at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York in November, a few weeks after Fledgling&#8217;s release. There she admitted to everyone that writing Fledgling was fun, that she hadn&#8217;t experienced this kind of joy in writing a novel for a very long time. In her most recent interviews, she was calling the new novel &#8220;light,&#8221; yet this playful description was meant in direct comparison to her previous novels, which are utopian in the heaviest sense you can imagine.</p> \n\n<p>I put &#8220;lecture&#8221; in quotation marks because all Butler wanted to do that night in New York was have conversation with the members of her audience. She refused to lecture. In their questions, many of her readers proved to be just as perspicacious as their writer-hero up there on stage lounging comfortably, as if this particular spot was for Butler no different than being at home in her reading chair. I remember thinking that these questions from the audience substantiate well the claim that every artist deserves the audience they end up getting.</p> \n\n<p>This particular audience was simply brilliant, in a laid-back kind of way. It was a hard-earned cool, a self-ironic knowingness based on the fact that they have been reading, and rereading, books written not for the market or for a clique of like-minded people but rather for the genuine love of our abused humanity.</p> \n\n<p>The line at the end of the lecture to have Butler sign the books they had brought with them was endlessly long and was not moving. I had brought several of my favorites for her to sign ( <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Patternmaster</a>, Dawn, and the Parable series) as well as my entire English class, who at the time was reading and studying <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Parable of the Sower</a> and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Parable of the Talents</a>. But the line&#8217;s lack of progress deterred me from joining, so I went home. The next day, when I asked my students how long they had had to wait, many shot me disapproving glances. Had it been necessary, they would have waited all night long.</p> \n\n<p>It turns out the line didn&#8217;t move well because Butler insisted on answering every question asked of her, including an intriguing one posed by a student of mine. He related to me and his classmates that he had asked her when his turn came why she made Lauren&#8217;s &#8220;hyper-empathy syndrome&#8221;-one of the main plot devices of the Parable series-so ambiguous, that is, biological, psychological, and socio-economic at the same time? Butler had paused, set down her pen and explained patiently to him her rationale.</p> \n\n<p>From the beginning, Butler&#8217;s genius was impossible to deny and nobody undertook what would have taken strenuous effort the attempt to do it. In the early 1980s she won the Hugo and Nebula Awards, which are science fiction&#8217;s most coveted prizes, and in 1995 she won the MacArthur Foundation Genius Grant. But you could still not find an official Octavia E. Butler web site, because one did not exist, on purpose, and never would. And forget about catching her on C-Span&#8217;s Booknotes or on Charlie Rose. She was an unapologetic, self-declared hermit yet I had suspected, which was confirmed for me while in her presence last November in New York, that she had a good political reason for always staying on the down low. She deliberately avoided celebrity status because it requires an end to thought, and that&#8217;s all her books do-think.</p> \n\n<p>Writing about one&#8217;s favorite writer, especially when that writer has without any notice up and died on you, should be short and to the point, because this exercise can lead into a long, drawn-out self-therapy session. I could use to talk about what Octavia Butler has meant to me, how she saved me more than a few times from cynicism, and more importantly how she has constantly enlivened my classrooms for the last sixteen years. But that would be for me, not for her. To her, I&#8217;d like to say three simple things.</p> \n\n<p>Thank you for weathering the storm of American irrationalism. The degradation of thinking and writing over the last twenty years in this society is hardly believable. If visited by another solar species-a storyline you made famous in your Xenogenesis trilogy ( <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Dawn</a>, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Adulthood Rites</a>, and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Imago</a>)-the conclusion they are compelled to draw is that the human species is unusually cute and often cuddly, and it continues to produce a lot of cute and cuddly art and literature, but its lethal and highly toxic fatal flaw has never been dealt with rationally, honestly, openly and systematically, and as a consequence we are now closer than ever to doing ourselves in, albeit in a really cute, cutting-edge, fashionable way.</p> \n\n<p>You called this fatal flaw our &#8220;hierarchical tendencies,&#8221; a pattern of species-specific behavior that is completely transparent to anyone who takes a moment to observe humans from outside their pre-programmed pro-corporate consciousness. How else can we keep missing it? All the genocidal wars of conquest and mass extermination, almost always for higher profit margins and therefore higher placement on the planet&#8217;s human-made, market-driven totem pole; the everyday assaults on each other&#8217;s vulnerable humanity; the unspeakable vengeance and spite. The frightening lack of historical consciousness and the idiotic denials of the root of the real chaos causing all the weak denials in the first place. The incessant and seemingly inexplicable exact repetitions of past blunders. A blind following of leaders who are absolutely not fit to rule, and the odd religious conservativeness in a species secular and often revolutionary in its actual possibilities; the familiar preference for easy comforts and solutions, for instant gratification over long-range planning, self-criticism, self-sacrifice, and rational experimentation with forethought and care.</p> \n\n<p>The second thing is that your books have encouraged the best feature of humanity, intellectual curiosity. Your books never close the door; instead they broaden current horizons and open up new ones. They make people want to go to the library and search out for themselves rational and scientific explanations for the opaque world in which we live. You have showed people that the thickness of reality can be penetrated through focused and persistent intellectual effort. You termed this type of mental labor a &#8220;positive obsession,&#8221; this trying to survive whole.</p> \n\n<p>The third thing is you have unsettled the minds of a lot of people who otherwise might have gone on thinking their shit don&#8217;t stink, people who think of themselves as morally-sound, broad-minded, liberal, and tolerant. You have in every book of yours flipped the script on them by showing they are very tolerant indeed, of racism and stupidity, illiteracy, hunger, preventable and treatable disease, the scapegoating, bullying, and persecution of the poor and the politically defenseless, legal theft and official lying, the wholesale deforestation of the planet and the capitalist single-minded pillaging of what remains of our earthly paradise, megalomania and self-seeking, and a lock-step obedience to irrational and discredited authority.</p> \n\n<p>In one of your last interviews, you put it tersely and profoundly as was your style. This style led many people to call you an oracle, a label that always made you chuckle. The interviewer had asked you if you&#8217;re pessimistic or optimistic about the future of the United States.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;At the present,&#8221; you answered, &#8220;I feel so unhopeful. I recognize we will pay more attention when we have different leadership. I&#8217;m not exactly sure where that leadership will come from. But that doesn&#8217;t mean I think we&#8217;re all going down the toilet, I just don&#8217;t see where that hope will come from. I think we need people with stronger ideals than John Kerry or Bill Clinton. I think we need people with more courage and vision. It&#8217;s a shame we have had people who are so damn weak.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Your own strengths as a writer and an intellectual, expressed always with a determined humility and without any fear of what those in power might say about it, will remain in all your novels. So we mourn not the loss of your words but of your future words and how they could have straightened out our thinking by focusing it on the root causes of all the purposefully fabricated and contrived confusions and controversies. It seems to me this is the whole lesson of your Parable books. Lauren created this new communist community you called Earthseed to save herself, but her great intention was for us readers to keep planting it deep in the ground of every place we live, work, and educate.</p> \n\n<p>JONATHAN SCOTT is Assistant Professor of English at the City University of New York, Borough of Manhattan Community College.

Here is the definition, from <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the+red+pill\" type=\"external\">Urban Dictionary</a>, should you feel like having a good laugh:</p> \n\n<p>Signifies the recognition of the true nature of female behavior, including her attraction to traits of dominance, preference for men with status, attraction to men who have been pre-selected by other women, and hypergamous nature. Red Pill men are aware that women are strongly influenced by the culture and that their attraction cues are often outside of their conscious awareness. Increasingly, modern women, and especially Western women, indulge in one-night stands and short-term relationship in their 20s with alpha males, followed by seeking out a beta male provider in their late 20s and early 30s. Red Pill men are aware of this phenomenon and develop a sexual strategy to benefit from a woman&#8217;s promiscuity as well as avoid the financial peril of marriage. Married men can also be Red Pill, as their awareness helps them handle female shit tests and maintain attraction with their partner.</p> \n\n<p>A man who has taken the Red Pill is committed to self-improvement and adapting to the reality of female behavior whether that be through the application of game in his relationships and/or withdrawing from LTRs.</p> \n\n<p>However, a wrench was thrown in their &#8220;game&#8221; when someone figured out their secret identities and <a href=\"https://jaredandjacobsaid.wordpress.com\" type=\"external\">exposed them on a blog</a>, enraging the both women mentioned on their posts and podcasts, and pretty much anyone else with an ounce of decency.</p> \n\n<p>Several businesses in the Asheville area have since cancelled their orders with Waking Life Espresso and pulled the product from the shelves. One business donated their remaining bottles to another store, which will be donating $50 to a rape crisis center for each bottle sold. Members of the community have rallied to protest outside the shop, with signs saying &#8220;We like our women like we like our coffee&#8211;not at Waking Life.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>One post on the &#8220;Holistic Game&#8221; blog (tagline: &#8220;Putting sweet D in the tender V since 2013&#8243;), titled &#8220; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150514232038/https://holisticgame.wordpress.com/2015/03/19/a-breakdown-of-all-my-lays/\" type=\"external\">A Breakdown of All My Lays</a>,&#8221; details the 50 women Rutledge claims to have had sex with since learning &#8220;game&#8221;&#8211; how he met them, how the sex went, and, perhaps most pathetically, his personal views on their prospects for future relationships.</p> \n\n<p>After being exposed, both&amp;#160;Jared Rutledge and Jacob Owens wrote long-ass apologies for their behavior, with Jared primarily blaming his behavior on his Christian upbringing and &#8220;insecurities,&#8221; and Jacob primarily blaming Jared. <a href=\"http://ashevilleblog.com/waking-life-espresso-is-under-fire/\" type=\"external\">You can read those here</a>, if you are into that sort of thing.</p> \n\n<p>However, we here at The Frisky are more concerned with the women mentioned in the posts, and how they feel after being betrayed in this manner.</p> \n\n<p>I spoke to one of the women on the list, and this is what she had to say:</p> \n\n<p>I was mortified when I realized I was listed. Complete shock. At a loss for words. I am half surprised the list exists. During the time I dated him, there was no indication that he was a sociopath simply looking to get laid. He demonstrated genuine feelings, and was disappointed when I decided to end things because I felt he wasn&#8217;t done dating other girls and getting a feel for what was out there.</p> \n\n<p>On the other hand, he was over analytical and really got in his own head, so the syntax used specifically in the &#8220;Breakdown of My Lays&#8221; post articulates his thought process on dating accurately.The apology is a bunch of a crap. They&#8217;re sorry they got caught. There is no doubt in my mind (based on the Tweets and blog posts) they would continue with their &#8220;game.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Another woman, who identifies herself as being the first woman on the &#8220;Breakdown of My Lays&#8221; post, has this to say:</p> \n\n<p>To those on the Waking Life list and those who love them,</p> \n\n<p>I vouched for him. For his character, for his business. Like many of us out there, I could not have predicted that my relationship with him would end here.</p> \n\n<p>I was in an awful place when I met him, in the wake an abusive relationship, and he made me feel like he was a safe harbor, someone I could share a bourbon with and vent to. I felt that my physical relationship was separate from my friendship with him&#8211; we had a meaningful platonic connection after our intimate relationship, and it&#8217;s unimaginable to me that he would say these things about someone he considered a friend.</p> \n\n<p>I was shocked that he would write these things about me, when I had given him compassionate advice and comfort in the past, after he confided very personal information to me. I thought of Jared as an equal, someone who suffered like I did- like any person in this world&#8211; and I thought he felt the same about me.</p> \n\n<p>Obviously, everything I believed about him was wrong. And even though I&#8217;m appalled and hurt by his actions, I&#8217;m elated by the response of the Asheville community. After moving from a city where I had few female friends, I feel like I&#8217;m in the world&#8217;s toughest girl gang, part of a group of the ultimate bad bitches. I know you ladies are here for me, and PLEASE know that I have your back, always.</p> \n\n<p>This weekend has been hellish for some of us, but we&#8217;re coming together to make the coming weeks amazing for all of us. I love you all so, so very much&#8211; I love you, Asheville.</p> \n\n<p>Even with their apologies, I think it is fair to say that it is pretty unlikely that either of these fellas is going to be getting laid anytime soon. At least not by any woman capable of using Google.</p> \n\n<p>[ <a href=\"http://ashevilleblog.com/waking-life-espresso-is-under-fire/\" type=\"external\">AshevilleBlog</a>] [ <a href=\"https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2015/09/20/west-asheville-coffee-brewed-outrage/72536502/\" type=\"external\">Citizen-Times</a>] [ <a href=\"https://jaredandjacobsaid.wordpress.com/page/5/\" type=\"external\">Jared And Jacob Said</a>]</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "These Misogynistic Asheville Coffee Shop Owners Will Probably Never Get Laid Again", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://thefrisky.com/2015-09-21/these-asheville-coffee-shop-owners-will-probably-never-get-laid-again/?utm_source%3Dsc-fb%26utm_medium%3Dref%26utm_campaign%3Dmisogynists", "published_at": "2018-10-07", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>We need to be clear on what is about to happen in the Iraqi city of Falluja, about 64 kilometres west of Baghdad and a key centre of Sunni population in Iraq. This city has for many months held out as a centre of Sunni-based political-military resistance, refusing to accept the authority either of the former US-led occupying authority nor, since July, of the interim Iraqi administration led by the Prime Minister, Iyad Allawi.</p> \n\n<p>Falluja is now to be brought to heel by overwhelming military power. As I write this, the US attack on the city has begun. The message to Falluja from the US armed forces in Iraq and from Allawi was brutally simple: submit now to Baghdad&#8217;s authority or face attack.</p> \n\n<p>It is still possible that resistance in Falluja will melt away in the face of US attack. While this would be a more optimistic scenario, I think it more likely at this point that the insurgents will fight, because too much is at stake politically for them to accept a bloodless Allawi victory. I look here at the&#8211;in my judgement, now more likely&#8211;scenario that Falluja insurgents will dig in and defy the invasion force.</p> \n\n<p>What I believe is then likely to be done to Falluja will be a war crime and crime against humanity, morally indefensible by any civilised standard or for that matter, by the Statute of the International Criminal Court (to which, conveniently, neither the US nor Iraqi Government adheres).</p> \n\n<p>This will be no neat, surgical strike. To get the measure of this, think of the Warsaw rising in 1944, or the Russian Army&#8217;s destruction of the Chechen capital, Grozny. In 1999 this already battered city (of originally 400,000 people) was finally destroyed by massive Russian bombardment. Today, insurgents still fight it out with Russian troops among the ruins.</p> \n\n<p>Eighteen months ago, before the US-led invasion of Iraq, Falluja was a living city of 300,000 people. Now&#8211;depopulated of most of its civilians by intimidation and fear&#8211;what is left looks like it is about to be blasted out of existence, simply as a demonstration of overwhelming US power in Iraq.</p> \n\n<p>Of course, the US Army has been for weeks &#8220;humanely&#8221; encouraging women and children to leave the encircled city through checkpoints while there is still time to save their lives.</p> \n\n<p>The Russians did the same before and during the destruction of Grozny. In a few days, as the battle and the flight of civilians expands, there may be tens of thousands of new refugees in tent cities, and tens of thousands of women left without husbands, and children left without fathers.</p> \n\n<p>If this attack goes ahead as appears inevitable, it will obviously breach the laws of war and the Geneva conventions. First, it will grossly exceed proportionality in terms of ends and means. What intended political or military objective could justify so much death, the creation of so many new refugees, and wholesale destruction of homes?</p> \n\n<p>What threat does the city of Falluja pose to the Iraqi state at this point? Allawi has claimed that free elections cannot take place unless Falluja is subdued. What a spurious argument.</p> \n\n<p>The truth is that this city, which has become a symbol of Sunni-Iraqi political resistance to the occupiers, is to be made an example of, to deter others. The message the siege of Falluja sends is brutally simple: resist us and we will destroy you. It is the same message that the Wehrmacht sent in Warsaw in 1944, and the Russian Army in Grozny in 1999.</p> \n\n<p>This attack will also violate the rules of war and the Geneva conventions in having grossly indiscriminate effects on civilians and civilian homes and infrastructure. America&#8217;s largely untrained in battle but over-armed forces will start their attack &#8220;humanely&#8221;, but as they inevitably take numbers of lethal casualties, their tactics will quickly escalate to indiscriminate bombing and shelling of the city using their WMD armouries.</p> \n\n<p>Eventually, the attackers will flatten the city and kill everyone that still resists in it. Falluja will be the Iraqi people&#8217;s Masada, and it will sow seeds of deep anti-Western hatred in the Middle East for decades to come.</p> \n\n<p>The UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, understands all this, in pleading for a negotiated solution. And as usual, Washington is summarily ignoring his pleas.</p> \n\n<p>As a military ally with our troops in Iraq, Australia is morally implicated in this. While Australian former SAS commanders, the Governor-General, Major-General Michael Jeffery, and the Australian Christian Lobby&#8217;s executive chairman, Brigadier Jim Wallace, moralise about abortions and gay marriages, Australia&#8217;s military ally is about to destroy a living city and its families.</p> \n\n<p>An unnamed US military commander in the tightening military ring around Falluja proudly boasted (as heard on ABC Radio yesterday) that this battle will go down in US military history as another Hue. Indeed it will&#8211;who can forget the wholesale artillery destruction of that sacred, historic Vietnamese city? &#8220;We had to destroy it in order to save it&#8221; was the line at the time. Now it looks like our military ally in Iraq is about to do it all over again in Falluja.</p> \n\n<p>What are Australian political leaders&#8211;Government or Opposition&#8211;saying to Washington at this point? Are they saying anything at all? We reap what we sow.</p> \n\n<p>TONY KEVIN, a former Australian diplomat, is a visiting fellow at the Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University, Canberra.</p> \n\n<p>This column originally appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "Fallujah and the Making of a War Crime", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2004/11/09/fallujah-and-the-making-of-a-war-crime/", "published_at": "2004-11-09", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\" />That&#8217;s just wonderful.</p> \n\n<p>Once part of one of the most brutal dictator&#8217;s army in the Middle East, over 100 former members of Saddam Hussein&#8217;s military and intelligence officers are now part of <a href=\"http://mol-hsk-cc4.andweb.dmgt.net:3110/news/isis/index.html\" type=\"external\">ISIS</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Now they make up the complex network of ISIS&#8217;s leadership, helping to build the military strategies which have led the brutal jihadi group to their military gains in <a href=\"http://mol-hsk-cc4.andweb.dmgt.net:3110/news/syria/index.html\" type=\"external\">Syria</a> and Iraq.</p> \n\n<p>The officers gave ISIS the organization and discipline it needed to weld together jihadi fighters drawn from across the globe, integrating terror tactics like suicide bombings with military operations.</p> \n\n<p>While attending the Iraqi army&#8217;s artillery school nearly 20 years ago, Ali Omran remembers one major well. An Islamic hard-liner, he once chided Omran for wearing an Iraqi flag pin into the bathroom because it included the words &#8216;God is great.&#8217;</p> \n\n<p>&#8216;It is forbidden by religion to bring the name of the Almighty into a defiled place like this,&#8217; Omran recalled being told by Maj. Taha Taher al-Ani.</p> \n\n<p>Omran didn&#8217;t see al-Ani again until years later, in 2003. The Americans had invaded Iraq and were storming toward Baghdad. Saddam Hussein&#8217;s fall was imminent.</p> \n\n<p>At a sprawling military base north of the capital, al-Ani was directing the loading of weapons, ammunition and ordnance into trucks to spirit away. He took those weapons with him when he joined Tawhid wa&#8217;l-Jihad, a forerunner of al-Qaida&#8217;s branch in Iraq.</p> \n\n<p>Now al-Ani is a commander in the Islamic State group, said Omran, who rose to become a major general in the Iraqi army and now commands its 5th Division fighting IS.</p> \n\n<p>He kept track of his former comrade through Iraq&#8217;s tribal networks and intelligence gathered by the government&#8217;s main counter terrorism service, of which he is a member.</p> \n\n<p>They have been put in charge of intelligence-gathering, spying on the Iraqi forces as well as maintaining and upgrading weapons and trying to develop a chemical weapons program.</p> \n\n<p>Patrick Skinner, a former CIA case officer who has served in Iraq, said Saddam-era military and intelligence officers were a &#8216;necessary ingredient&#8217; in the Islamic State group&#8217;s stunning battlefield successes last year, accounting for its transformation from a &#8216;terrorist organization to a proto-state.&#8217;</p> \n\n<p>&#8216;Their military successes last year were not terrorist, they were military successes,&#8217; said Skinner, now director of special projects for The Soufan Group, a private strategic intelligence services firm.</p> \n\n<p>The group&#8217;s second-in-command, al-Baghdadi&#8217;s deputy, is a former Saddam-era army major, Saud Mohsen Hassan, known by the pseudonyms Abu Mutazz and Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, according to the intelligence chief.</p> \n\n<p>Hassan also goes by Fadel al-Hayali, a fake name he used before the fall of Saddam, the intelligence chief, who spoke under the condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.</p> \n\n<p>During the 2000s, Hassan was imprisoned in the notorious U.S.-run Bucca prison camp, the main detention center for members of the Sunni insurgency, where al-Baghdadi also was held.</p> \n\n<p>The prison was a significant incubator for the Islamic State group, bringing militants like al-Baghdadi into contact with former Saddam officers, including members of special forces, the elite Republican Guard and the paramilitary force called Fedayeen.</p> \n\n<p>In Bucca&#8217;s Ward 6, al-Baghdadi gave sermons and Hassan emerged as an effective organizer, leading strikes by the prisoners to gain concessions from their American jailers, the intelligence chief said.</p> \n\n<p>Former Bucca prisoners are now throughout the IS leadership. Among them is Abu Alaa al-Afari, a veteran Iraqi militant who was once with al-Qaida and now serves as the head of IS&#8217;s &#8216;Beit al-Mal,&#8217; or treasury, according to a chart of what is believed to be the group&#8217;s hierarchy provided to the AP by the intelligence chief.</p> \n\n<p>Al-Baghdadi has drawn these trusted comrades even closer after he was wounded in an airstrike earlier this year, the intelligence chief said.</p> \n\n<p>He has appointed a number of them to the group&#8217;s Military Council, believed to have seven to nine members &#8211; at least four of whom are former Saddam officers. He brought other former Bucca inmates into his inner circle and personal security.</p> \n\n<p>Saddam-era veterans also serve as &#8216;governors&#8217; for seven of the 12 &#8216;provinces&#8217; set up by the Islamic State group in the territory it holds in Iraq, the intelligence chief said.</p> \n\n<p>Iraqi officials acknowledge that identifying IS leadership is an uncertain task. Besides al-Baghdadi himself, the group almost never makes public even the pseudonyms of those in its hierarchy.</p> \n\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3190314/The-secret-ISIS-s-success-100-former-Saddam-Hussein-era-officers-run-jihadi-group-s-military-intelligence-operations-Iraq-Syria.html#ixzz3iEmFKwiE\" type=\"external\">dailymail.co.uk</a></p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />", "title": "THE SECRET TO ISIS\u2019S SUCCESS: Over 100 Ex Saddam Hussein Officers are Running the Jihadi Camps", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://girlsjustwannahaveguns.com/the-secret-to-isiss-success-over-100-ex-saddam-hussein-officers-are-running-the-jihadi-camps/", "published_at": "", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>The historic stock bull market that grew out of the ashes of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression officially turns five years old this weekend.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>While sophisticated investors continue to count their gains from the second best bull run in the post-war period, many battle-scarred retail investors feel left out of the party.</p> \n\n<p>Ironically, the lack of retail participation during much the '09-'14 run may have helped keep it alive, preventing valuations from getting out of whack with mediocre fundamentals.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Bull markets come to an end when everybody has bought in. People tend to sell at the same time, but they buy in at staggered times,&#8221; said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S&amp;amp;P Capital IQ.</p> \n\n<p>Since bottoming out at 6547 on March 9, 2009, the Dow Industrials have ripped off nearly 10,000 points as the collapse of the financial system was averted and economic growth eventually returned.</p> \n\n<p>A bull market is typically defined as an advance of 20% after a decline of 20% or more that lasts a minimum of six months.

The next closest bull market performance through five years was the 111% rally for the streak that began in 1949.</p> \n\n<p>Impressively, the current market also took just five years to get back to breakeven, compared with the 25 years before stocks recovered from the Great Crash of &#8217;29.</p> \n\n<p>\"The big story about the five-year anniversary is all of the investors who haven&#8217;t participated because they were scarred by 2008.\"</p> \n\n<p>The tremendous advance on Wall Street has been fueled by the return of economic growth, albeit at a slower pace than desirable, and incredibly easy money policies from the Federal Reserve.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;This whole cycle has been notable for its anemic fundamental gains, but sharp price rebound,&#8221; said Bruce McCain, who helps oversee more than $20 billion as chief investment strategist at KeyCorp&#8217;s (NYSE:KEY) Key Private Bank.</p> \n\n<p>Job growth has returned, though not as strong as hoped for. Profits have surged, but a large chunk is attributed to cost cutting. U.S. companies are struggling to grow revenues organically and remain reluctant to reinvest profits in job-creating projects.</p> \n\n<p>Shattered Confidence Hurts Participation</p> \n\n<p>Despite the duration of the bull market, it&#8217;s clear the battle scars of 2007-2009 have not healed.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It was brutally painful. On a purely gut level, it was terrifying,&#8221; said Peter Kenny, co-chairman and CEO of financial technology firm The Clearpool Group who correctly called the market bottom in March 2009.</p> \n\n<p>Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors, said: &#8220;We had seen institutions crumble. There was this incredible tension in the marketplace and a lack of confidence that investors hadn&#8217;t seen in decades.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Much of that mood has persisted for years. The big story about the five-year anniversary is all of the investors who haven&#8217;t participated because they were scarred by 2008,&#8221; she said.</p> \n\n<p>Just two months ago, Wall Street was buzzing about how 2014 looked like a repeat of 1929. Those fears and subsequent pullback (5% or more decline) were driven by concerns about emerging markets like <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">China</a> and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Argentina</a>, but they were underpinned by the memories of 2008.</p> \n\n<p>Panicked <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">investors yanked $6.4 billion from emerging-market stock funds</a> in a single week, the most in almost three years.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Whenever there are tremors in the market there have been significant flows out of them as well,&#8221; said Hooper.</p> \n\n<p>No Melt Up...Yet</p> \n\n<p>Those investors who were understandably spooked ended up missing out on a rebound on Wall Street that carried stocks to fresh all-time highs just weeks later.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Investors aren&#8217;t willing to move in and stay in. Treat this as a permanent allocation or you will miss out on some of the best moves in the market. You have to be in it all the time,&#8221; said Hooper.</p> \n\n<p>Of course, if retail investors had gone all in, the current bull market likely would have died already.</p> \n\n<p>That&#8217;s because valuations would have gotten ahead of the so-so fundamentals, causing a melt up followed by a meltdown.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;There is this sense that we&#8217;ve all learned a lesson we don&#8217;t ever want to forget. It is precisely because of that sense of caution that the market has continued to find room to move higher,&#8221; said Kenny.</p> \n\n<p>Sixth Birthday Ahead?</p> \n\n<p>The question is whether it&#8217;s too late for investors to jump back into equities five years into the bull run.</p> \n\n<p>Stovall said that while 85% of the bull markets that celebrated their fourth birthdays went on to see their fifth, only 60% of those that lasted five years celebrated their sixth birthday.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The sixth birthday becomes a little bit more challenging. Everybody has to meet their maker one of these days,&#8221; he said.</p> \n\n<p>Still, Stovall said he believes equities have a &#8220;good chance&#8221; of extending their run another year, but warns the price gain will likely be more &#8220;subdued&#8221; than the average surge of 26% in all sixth years since World War II.</p> \n\n<p>For another year of green, he said the U.S. economy must accelerate to 3% by the end of 2014, earnings growth needs to stay on track and valuations need to stay within historic norms.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, I do think retail investors will come back, but they will never forget what happened to them, their future and their hard earned money in that market rout that ended five years ago,&#8221; said Kenny.</p>", "title": "Crisis Scars Linger Even as Bull Market Turns Five", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/markets/2014/03/07/crisis-scars-linger-even-as-bull-market-turns-5.html", "published_at": "2016-03-06", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>Growth in U.S. consumer credit cooled in September as households appeared to use their credit cards more sparingly, Federal Reserve data showed on Wednesday.</p> \n\n<p>Consumer credit grew $11.36 billion in September, just above the median forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.

Covering 4 square miles and more than 100 feet deep, it contains 2.9 billion cubic feet of trash, including 100 million tons of newspaper, paint cans, potato peels, cigarette butts, chicken bones, dryer lint, and an occasional corpse. New Yorkers dump 26 million pounds of trash at Fresh Kills daily. By the time it closes in 2001, it will be the tallest hill on the Eastern seaboard. But as massive as Fresh Kills is, it takes in just .02 percent of the waste generated in the United States. Every day, Americans dispose of an additional 5,300 times as much waste elsewhere.</p> \n\n<p>Americans, who have the largest material requirements in the world, each directly or indirectly use an average of 125 pounds of material every day, or about 23 tons per year. This consumption consists of fuels in the form of gas, coal, and oil; quarried materials such as stone, gravel, and sand; industrial minerals such as phosphate, cement, and gypsum; industrial metals such as copper and aluminum; forestry products such as sawed timber, pulpwood for paper, and firewood; and agricultural products such as milk, meat, eggs, grain, hay, and produce.</p> \n\n<p>Americans waste more than 1 million pounds per person per year. This includes: 3.5 billion pounds (920 million square yards) of carpet sent to landfills, 25 billion pounds of carbon dioxide, and 6 billion pounds of polystyrene. Domestically, we waste 28 billion pounds of food, 300 billion pounds of organic and inorganic chemicals used for manufacturing and processing, and 700 billion pounds of hazardous waste generated by chemical production. If you count the waste developed in extracting gas, coal, oil, and minerals, that would add another 34 trillion pounds per year.</p> \n\n<p>Furthermore, domestic figures for material flows do not account for the waste generated overseas on our behalf. For example, the <a href=\"/news/feature/1996/09/bryce.html\" type=\"external\">Freeport-McMoRan gold mine</a> in Irian Jaya annually dumps 66 pounds of tailings and toxic waste into Indonesian rivers for every man, woman, and child in the United States. Only a tiny fraction of the 125,000 tons of daily waste material comes to the United States as gold. The rest remains there.</p> \n\n<p>Total wastes, excluding wastewater, exceed 50 trillion pounds a year in the United States. (A trillion is a big number. To count to 50 trillion at the rate of one numeral per second would require the cumulative and total lifetimes of 23,000 people.) If you add wastewater, the total flow of American waste equals at least 250 trillion pounds. Less than 5 percent of the total waste stream actually gets recycled &#8212; primarily paper, glass, plastic, aluminum, and steel.</p> \n\n<p>We are far better at making waste than at making products. For every 100 pounds of product we manufacture in the United States, we create at least 3,200 pounds of waste. In a decade, we transform 500 trillion pounds of molecules into nonproductive solids, liquids, and gases.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Resource Waste", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/1997/03/resource-waste/", "published_at": "2018-03-01", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>To understand how Microsoft can learn all about you, visit one of the company&#8217;s new city-guide Web sites, known as <a href=\"http://www.sidewalk.com\" type=\"external\">Sidewalk</a>. There are now 10 of them, including Boston, New York, San Francisco, and Sydney (Australia), with more on the way, and they&#8217;re chock-full of information about restaurants, movies, and other ways to spend your leisure time. If you have a fondness for topless bars, those are listed; if you&#8217;re curious about gay bars, you can find those as well. You can even customize a site to update with new activities that fit your interests. It is undeniably convenient.</p> \n\n<p>But at the very bottom of Sidewalk New York&#8217;s opening page, there is a small, almost unnoticeable blurb that reads &#8220;Terms of Use.&#8221; It begins rather murkily:</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>This Web site is offered to the user conditioned on the user&#8217;s acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein. By accessing and using this Web site, the user is deemed to have agreed to all such terms, conditions, and notices.</p> \n\n<p>That&#8217;s a little weird: After all, the instant you land on the site, you&#8217;ve accessed and used it, thereby agreeing to Microsoft&#8217;s terms before you even know what they are. Then, if you scroll farther down, you come to a line simply titled &#8220;Use of Information.&#8221; It reads:</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>By being a user of this Web site, the user agrees that Microsoft may share with other parties both aggregate information, individual information, and locator information gathered by Microsoft in the course of the user&#8217;s continuing individual use of this Web site.</p> \n\n<p>That seems inoffensive enough, until you come to the part about &#8220;locator information.&#8221; Locator information, according to Microsoft, &#8220;consists of a user&#8217;s name, e-mail address, physical address, and/or other data about the user that enables the recipient to personally identify the user.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>If this line doesn&#8217;t stop you in your cybertracks, well, then Microsoft loves you for it. After all the hard-to-find legalese, Microsoft&#8217;s intentions become bluntly clear: You are giving Microsoft permission to collect specific, highly personal information on who you are and what you do&#8212;collected as you surf. Microsoft learns your taste in film, culture, politics, sex. And then it can do whatever it wants with that information.</p> \n\n<p>Microsoft can preserve such data indefinitely, for its own use, until you die. And it&#8217;s a safe bet that, sooner or later, Microsoft will sell it to other businesses because such information is a valuable commodity. Microsoft could sell it to a direct-marketing company; it could sell it to your health insurer or your employer; it could, theoretically, give it to the FBI, which is conducting a background check on you. Or Microsoft could simply use the data for its own commercial purposes, collecting as much information about you as, say, the government does&#8212;but with far less oversight.</p> \n\n<p>You don&#8217;t have to be a privacy rights fanatic to find such information collection alarming. &#8220;Microsoft has the ability to automate data collection in a way that no one else does,&#8221; says Paul Saffo, a director at the <a href=\"http://www.iftf.org\" type=\"external\">Institute for the Future</a> in Menlo Park, California. Lauren Weinstein, the moderator of the Web site <a href=\"http://www.vortex.com/privacy.htm\" type=\"external\">Privacy Forum</a>, adds, &#8220;Consumers feel that Microsoft takes a parental attitude: &#8216;Trust us, we know what&#8217;s best, we&#8217;ll take good care of you.'&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Saffo and Weinstein say that what Microsoft can do isn&#8217;t qualitatively different from what, for example, banks and credit card companies try to do. But &#8220;because Microsoft has such a wide reach,&#8221; Weinstein explains, &#8220;the amount of potential power and the amount of potential problems are multiplied.&#8221; Admits Megan Bowman, Microsoft&#8217;s government affairs manager: &#8220;We&#8217;re hard to compare to some of the other actors just because of the breadth of our business.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The inevitable domination of its Internet Explorer browser means that Microsoft has another way of gathering information about you: The browser can keep track of your stopping points along the Web&#8212;your &#8220;clickstream&#8221;&#8212;and that information could be transferred to Microsoft when you visit one of its Web sites. Given the lack of government Internet oversight, it&#8217;s completely legal. In a new ad campaign, Microsoft describes I.E. 4 as a &#8220;faster, more personalized Web browser&#8221; and promotes &#8220;content that can only be viewed with Internet Explorer 4.&#8221; It&#8217;s a seamless horizontal ladder: You use Windows to open Explorer to access, say, Carpoint, Microsoft&#8217;s online car-buying service, and details of the sites you&#8217;ve visited previously can be sent to Microsoft&#8212;like a pipeline from your brain to Redmond.</p> \n\n<p>This, of course, can all sound a little paranoid. But Microsoft has given experts who follow privacy issues ample reason to worry in the past.</p> \n\n<p>Most notorious is the Windows 95 &#8220;Registration Wizard.&#8221; Back when Microsoft was releasing early versions of the operating system, it introduced a rather remarkable feature: To register your software, the system calls up Microsoft via modem. During the process, Windows asks whether it can send Microsoft information about your computer. If you agree, Windows, exploring your computer, will tell the company what other products you use.</p> \n\n<p>But savvy users pointed out that Windows doesn&#8217;t just send back information about Microsoft programs on your hard drive; it will also send back data about competitors&#8217; programs. After furious protests by developers, Microsoft defended the program, saying it was for the consumer&#8217;s benefit: If you have a compatibility problem, Microsoft will know what software you have and can help you diagnose the problem.</p> \n\n<p>The company has still another means of accessing information from your computer: Internet Explorer contains a &#8220;File Upload&#8221; feature, which allows users to send information to Web sites. But the feature also reportedly can allow Web servers to upload files from your hard drive without your knowledge. (To be fair, Netscape used it first, in Navigator.)</p> \n\n<p>And then there are &#8220;cookies,&#8221; small text files that a Web site can write onto your hard drive. The cookie can retain information about whatever you do on that Web site, such as using your credit card to buy a magazine subscription. The next time you visit that site, the cookie enables the Web site&#8217;s owner to determine who you are and sometimes even what other sites you&#8217;ve been visiting. (Due to complaints&#8212;and probably to fend off government regulation&#8212;Netscape and Microsoft built tools into their browsers that let you block cookies.)</p> \n\n<p>The likelihood of Microsoft becoming a major information clearinghouse grows with the number of services it provides. In addition to Sidewalk, Microsoft also operates Slate, an online magazine; Expedia, an Internet travel business; Investor, a financial services site; and Carpoint.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The only sensitivity they have about privacy is that it could present obstacles to some business venture,&#8221; says James Love, director of Ralph Nader&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.essential.org/cpt/\" type=\"external\">Consumer Project on Technology</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Says Microsoft&#8217;s Bowman: &#8220;A lot of the promise of the Internet is in personalization. When people understand what value they get for providing information, and that that information is protected, they will feel quite comfortable providing it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>So how does Bowman, who says Microsoft does not now sell user information, explain Sidewalk&#8217;s Terms of Use, which can also be found on Microsoft&#8217;s other online services? &#8220;The language is just designed to be fairly open to anticipate a number of ways in which we might provide you with more information and benefits,&#8221; she says.</p> \n\n<p>Consider, for example, the different ways Slate learns about its readers. The magazine recently posted and e-mailed to registered Slate readers an extremely detailed survey.</p> \n\n<p>An accompanying note from Rogers Weed, Slate&#8216;s publisher, downplays any privacy concerns: &#8220;Contrary to what some people believe, we in cyberspace do not secretly scan your hard drive while you surf Slate.&#8221; And many of the questions seem fairly standard (What is your total household income? Do you read your newspaper&#8217;s editorial page?). But the information also helps Microsoft understand the potential for new online markets, possibly to develop future Web sites, and allows the company to integrate itself into your life, so that you find it as hard to live without Microsoft as, say, to extricate Explorer from Windows.</p> \n\n<p>For Microsoft, there is a massive amount of valuable information out there, and little standing in its way. As Love puts it, &#8220;From a privacy point of view, Microsoft is a very big deal&#8212;and a lot of what&#8217;s a big deal hasn&#8217;t even happened yet.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Richard Blow is a Mother Jones contributing writer and a senior editor at George magazine.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Lock Your Windows", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/1998/01/lock-your-windows/", "published_at": "2018-01-01", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>The Bush administration <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060905/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush_terrorism\" type=\"external\">released an assessment</a> of its terrorism-combatting efforts to date.

Baum was an Irish nationalist newspaper editor, a former resident of Aberdeen in the old Dakota Indian territory. His sympathies with the village pioneers caused him to invent the Oz fantasy to justify extermination. All of Baum&#8217;s &#8220;innocent&#8221; symbols clearly represent easily recognizable frontier landmarks, political realities, and peoples. These symbols were presented to frontier children, to prepare them for their racially violent future.</p> \n\n<p>The Yellow Brick Road represents the yellow brick gold at the end of the Bozeman Road to the Montana gold fields. Chief Red Cloud had forced the razing of several posts, including Fort Phil Kearney, and had forced the signing of the Fort Laramie Treaty. When George Armstrong Custer cut &#8220;the Thieves&#8217; Road&#8221; during his 1874 gold expedition invasion of the sacred Black Hills, he violated this treaty, and turned U.S. foreign policy toward the Little Big Horn and the Wounded Knee massacre.</p> \n\n<p>The Winged Monkeys are the Irish Baum&#8217;s satire on the old Northwest Mounted Police, who were modelled on the Irish Constabulary. The scarlet tunic of the Mounties, and the distinctive &#8220;pillbox&#8221; forage cap with the narrow visor and strap are seen clearly in the color plate in the 1900 first edition of &#8220;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&#8221;. Villagers across the Dakota territory heartily despised these British police, especially after 1877, when Sitting Bull retreated across the border and into their protection after killing Custer.</p> \n\n<p>The Shifting Sands, the Deadly Desert, the Great Sandy Waste, and the Impassable Desert are Frank Baum&#8217;s reference to that area of the froniter known always as &#8220;the great American desert&#8221;, west and south of the Great Lakes. Baum creates these fictional, barren areas as protective buffers for his Oz utopia, against hostile, foreign people. This &#8220;buffer state&#8221; practice had been part of U.S. foreign policy against the Indians, since the earliest colonial days.</p> \n\n<p>The Emerald City of Oz recreates the Irish nationalist&#8217;s vision of the Emerald Isle, the sacred land, Ireland, set in this American desert like the sacred Paha Sapa of the Lakota people, these mineral-rich Black Hills floored by coal. Irish settlements in the territories, in Kansas, Nebraska, and Minnesota&#8211;at Brule City, Limerick, at Lalla Rookh, and at O&#8217;Neill two hundred miles south of Aberdeen&#8211;founded invasions of the Black Hills.</p> \n\n<p>The Yellow Winkies, slaves, are Frank Baum&#8217;s symbol for the sizable Chinese population in the old West, emigrated for the Union-Pacific railroad, creatures with the slant or winking eyes.</p> \n\n<p>The Deadly Poppy Field is the innocent child&#8217;s first sight of opium, that anodyne of choice for pain in the nineteenth century, sold in patent medicines, in the Wizard Oil, at the travelling Indian medicine shows. Baum&#8217;s deadly poppies are the poison opium, causing sleep and the fatal dream.</p> \n\n<p>The Wicked Witch of the West is illustrated in the 1900 first edition as a pickaninny, with beribboned, braided pigtails extended comically. Baum repeats the word &#8220;brown&#8221; in describing her. But this symbol&#8217;s real historic depth lies in the earlier Puritans&#8217; confounding of European witches with the equally heathen American Indians.</p> \n\n<p>The orphan Dorothy&#8217;s violent removal from Kansas civilization, her search for secret and magical cures for her friends, her capture, enslavement to an evil figure&#8211;and the killing of this figure that is forced on her&#8211;all these themes Baum takes from the already two hundred year old tradition of the Indian captivity narrative which stoked the fires of Indian-hating and its hope of &#8220;redemption through violence&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>In the year immediately following the huge success of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Baum wrote a fantasy entitled The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus. It is apparent that his frontier experiences were still on his mind. The book was illustrated by Mary Cowles Clark&#8211;tomahawks, spears, the hide- covered teepees, and the faces of Indian men, women, and children, and papooses fill the pages and the margins. Baum describes the &#8220;rude tent of skins on a broad plain&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>Two crucial chapters are titled &#8220;The Wickedness of the Awgwas&#8221; and &#8220;The Great Battle Between Good and Evil&#8221;. The Awgwas represent native Americans: &#8220;that terrible race of creatures&#8221; and &#8220;the wicked tribe&#8221;. Baum condemns the Awgwas:</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;You are a transient race, passing from life into nothingness. We, who live forever, pity but despise you. On earth you are scorned by all, and in Heaven you have no place! Even the mortals, after their earth life, enter another existence for all time, and so are your superiors.&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>Predictably enough, a few pages later, &#8220;all that remained of the wicked Awgwas was a great number of earthen hillocks dotting the plain.&#8221; Baum is recalling newspaper photos of the burial field at Wounded Knee.</p> \n\n<p>The Wizard of Oz in 1899 ruling his empire from behind his Barrier of Invisibility evokes the 1869 Imperial Wizard of the Invisible Empire of the South, the Ku Klux Klan. Baum&#8217;s figure King Crow and his by-play with the Scarecrow relate to the Jim Crow lynch law at the turn of the century.</p> \n\n<p>Lyman Frank Baum&#8217;s overwhelmingly popular fantasy, and the more violent aspects of United States foreign policy, were welded togehter in the American mind for the next century and beyond. Frank Baum&#8217;s widow, at the Hollywood premiere of &#8220;The Wizard of Oz&#8221; in 1939, complained that the story had been sentimentalized. Indeed, the old and crudely direct political symbols had been removed, and the sweetness poured in&#8211;the new U.S. foreign policy demanded more subtle justifications.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>THOMAS ST.

There, he'll sign the so-called \"Buy American, Hire American\" executive order.</p> \n\n<p>The order \"would direct the departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Labor and State to propose new rules to prevent immigration fraud and abuse,\" the <a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_TRUMP_WISCONSIN?SITE=AP&amp;amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;amp;CTIME=2017-04-17-22-38-06\" type=\"external\">Associated Press</a> reported. \"Those departments would also be asked to offer changes so that H-1B visas are awarded to the 'most-skilled or highest-paid applicants.'\"</p> \n\n<p>The White House said the program is currently undercutting American workers by bringing in cheaper labor and said some tech companies are using it to hire large numbers of workers and drive down wages.</p> \n\n<p>Administration officials said the order also seeks to strengthen requirements that American-made products be used in certain federal construction projects, as well as in various federal transportation grant-funded projects. The officials said the commerce secretary will review how to close loopholes in enforcing the existing rules and provide recommendations to the president.</p> \n\n<p>The order specifically asks the secretary to review waivers of these rules that exist in free-trade agreements. The administration said that if the waivers are not benefiting the United States they will be \"renegotiated or revoked.\"</p> \n\n<p>During his campaign, Trump said at some point that he supported high-skilled visas, then came out against them. At one debate, he called for fully ending the program, saying: \"It's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers. And we should end it.\"</p> \n\n<p>The H-1B visa program lets more than 85,000 foreign workers into America each year, and the visiting workers often take high-skilled jobs Americans could have. Abuses have run rampant, with companies using the visas to get workers for salaries far under the prevailing wage -- who often take jobs from newly graduated college students.</p> \n\n<p>The Trump order won't fulfill his promise to end the program. But it will rewrite rules for a lottery system that is used to determine the companies that can sponsor visas, the AP wrote.</p> \n\n<p>On the \"Buy American\" plan, Trump's move will limit and tighten waivers and exemptions that federal agencies often deploy to evade procurement laws already on the books. Those laws require agencies to use U.S.-made goods and services. Trump, who throughout the campaign railed against other nations that use unfair trade practices, is also seeking to crack down on low bids that shut out U.S. companies.</p>", "title": "Trump Set to Sign 'Buy American, Hire American' Executive Order", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://dailywire.com/news/15490/trump-set-sign-buy-american-hire-american-joseph-curl", "published_at": "2017-04-18", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Oil&amp;#160;prices rose more than 1 percent on Thursday, on track for a fourth straight day of gains, but analysts remained cautious about record-high U.S. crude inventories.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Brent crude futures gained 61 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $54.97 a barrel by 2:21 p.m. EDT (1921 GMT).

But it took the company growing to about 26,000 stores in 75 countries to win the credibility he felt necessary to make the leap into the country that gave espresso to the world.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>\"I didn't think we were ready to come to Italy,\" Schultz told The Associated Press in an interview Monday. \"I think Italy is such a special place. I am so respectful of the Italian coffee heritage and the Italian culture, and I think we had to earn that respect, opportunity, and I think over the years we got to the point that we are now ready to come.\"</p> \n\n<p>As he prepares to step down as CEO in April, Schultz will focus on innovation. That includes a Milan location that will open in 2018 of what he called \"the quintessential Roastery\" &#8212; one of the high-end shops featuring in-house roasting and complex coffee drinks. The journey of 35 years, he said, completes \"my own dream and the circle of Starbucks.\"</p> \n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, skeptics like 70-year-old Christine Kung see Starbucks as a coals-to-Newcastle enterprise.</p> \n\n<p>\"We are happy the way we are,\" Kung said on her way to a bar for coffee in central Milan. \"We don't need to be invaded by American scenery. We already have McDonald's and that's enough.\"</p> \n\n<p>Indeed, the entry of McDonald's into Italy three decades ago sparked the Slow Food movement that encourages local food traditions, although it ultimately did not prevent the Golden Arches and other fast-food chains that followed from becoming part of the Italian landscape.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Still, espresso drinks are part of Italian tradition and the fabric of everyday life in a way a quick bite still is not. Italians are accustomed to \"taking\" an espresso standing at the bar for an average price of 1 euro, or just about a dollar, even in major cities; 1.20-1.50 euros is on par for a cappuccino.</p> \n\n<p>In Italy, baristas generally make the coffee in full sight of the consumer, and hand brioche and other pastries across a glass case, often with a quip. Taking a seat in an Italian bar may incur an extra charge, especially in prime locations. There are few sugary embellishments and Wi-Fi access is spotty, at best.</p> \n\n<p>It is not uncommon to see waiters with silver trays delivering coffee in porcelain cups covered with foil to neighboring business, a practice that underlies the rarity of the takeout coffee cup.</p> \n\n<p>This sort of humanity attracted Schultz's admiration on his first Milan visit. His response is to position the first Starbucks in Italy as a premium operation.</p> \n\n<p>The Milan store at Piazza Cordusio will be among the early wave of up to 30 Roastery locations Starbucks says it expects to open around the world. The Milan store will launch a new partnership with an Italian partner, the Princi baker, offering deli food and baked goods. The first Roastery is in Seattle, with others announced for Shanghai, New York and Tokyo.</p> \n\n<p>Besides mainstay espresso drinks, Schultz hopes customers will be attracted by specialized brewing techniques developed by Starbucks that are not typical in Italy. As in other markets, customers can take coffee out, or drink out of porcelain cups if they're staying in. Starbucks says it hasn't yet determined its prices.</p> \n\n<p>Located in an old post office building just steps from Milan's cathedral, the store will be the largest to date at 25,500 square feet, or about 2,400 square meters &#8212; compared with 200 square feet for the average Starbucks location.</p> \n\n<p>It is hard to gauge how many in Italy might share Kung's wariness. Schultz says market research indicates strong brand awareness among Italians, mostly from travels abroad. And younger Italians may be more disposed toward embracing Starbucks as a place to hang out. Twenty-year-old Giulia Rizzi said she is excited for the opening and has no doubt her peers will frequent Starbucks in Italy.</p> \n\n<p>\"When I go abroad it's a place I go to very often because I like it both for the place and for what they do, which can't often be found in Italy,\" she said. \"Of course in Italy coffee is sacred so perhaps not everyone will like it.\"</p> \n\n<p>But the brand took a brief battering on social media, along with city planners in Italy's finance and fashion capital, after an oasis of palm trees appeared opposite the cathedral and it emerged that Starbucks was paying for the landscaping project, chosen by the city. Vandals burned a couple of the trees.</p> \n\n<p>The fate of the Italian enterprise, Schultz said, will depend on winning over Italian customers, not just tourists. Schultz has been getting guidance on how to approach the Italian market from fashion designer and CEO Brunello Cucinelli. His advice: \"For Starbucks to be authentic. For us to be ourselves,\" Schultz said.</p> \n\n<p>After the Roastery, Starbucks plans to open other locations in Milan, a combination of traditional stores and Reserve stores, which are essentially smaller Roasteries, before it looks at other Italian cities. Schultz didn't say how many stores are planned for Milan, but noted in the past 10 to 12 have opened within the first year of entering a market.</p> \n\n<p>So far, Starbucks' plans aren't worrying the folks at one typical Milanese coffee bar, the Giacomo Caffe with its wooden bar, round tables and straight-back chairs located in the Palazzo Reale beside Piazza Duomo, not far from the new Starbucks location.</p> \n\n<p>\"It is something completely different,\" said manager Antimo Santoro. \"Their strongest point is to take away, to buy and take away. Our strong point is service, we serve a coffee of very high quality, with a very refined blend, a great service.\" ____ Charlene Pele in Milan contributed to this report.</p>", "title": "Starbucks CEO says Chain Ready to Enter Italy after 35 years", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2017/02/28/starbucks-ceo-says-chain-ready-to-enter-italy-after-35-years.html", "published_at": "2017-02-28", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>The U.S. has far too many malls scrambling to attract consumers at a time when online shopping is tightening its grip.</p> \n\n<p>That doesn't mean middling malls will die quickly, however.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Projections for hundreds of shopping centers to close in the next five years could prove too pessimistic. A more likely outcome, analysts said: many weaker malls will turn into zombies, staying open for years as they cycle through increasingly less successful retailers before finally being repurposed or leveled.</p> \n\n<p>\"It takes a very long time to transition these malls,\" said Thomas Dobrowski, executive managing director of capital markets at real estate services firm Newmark Knight Frank. \"They don't die of heart attacks.\"</p> \n\n<p>Part of the reason for weak malls' persistence lies in contracts signed years or decades ago. Landlords typically strike leases of 10 or 20 years with multiple tenants, making speedy exits difficult. In some cases, lease buyouts can be negotiated, but the process can be expensive and lengthy.</p> \n\n<p>Owners hoping to close malls and redevelop them for other uses might also run into regulatory hurdles. Getting buy-in from the local community takes time and rezoning approvals might not happen, especially in areas where sales tax revenue makes up a big chunk of the local government's budget.</p> \n\n<p>Of the 41 malls Mr. Dobrowski has helped to sell since 2012, most of which were distressed sales, only one, Granite Run Mall in Media, Penn., has been closed and redeveloped. The others are still operating as malls.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>The two-story Granite Run Mall was foreclosed on in 2010 after struggling with vacancies. It was sold in 2013 to BET Investments, which is redeveloping the site into a mixed-use property with open-air retail, entertainment and roughly 400 apartments. The demolition started only in 2016 as the firm waited for leases to expire and for government approvals for the redevelopment.</p> \n\n<p>\"You can't just tear it down while tenants are in there,\" said Bruce Toll, principal at BET Investments and a co-founder of home builder Toll Brothers Inc.</p> \n\n<p>Roughly 200 malls have closed since 2007, according to Newmark Knight Frank. But the amount of square feet of retail space has increased 10.4% over the same period, according to data from CoStar Group. Part of that is due to the continued development of mixed-use centers in urban markets, but the steady growth in supply is also partly due to the slow pace of demolishing or transforming struggling malls for other uses.</p> \n\n<p>Between 2007 and 2016, at least 275 enclosed malls, strip malls and open-air shopping centers were foreclosed on after their owners ran into difficulties repaying their securitized mortgage loans, according to data from Trepp Inc. Most of the properties live on as retail entities, with some adding medical clinics, tax and insurance offices, and gyms to their tenant mix.</p> \n\n<p>After foreclosure, distressed retail assets are sometimes sold at rock-bottom prices. Some owners do minimal work on their newly acquired shopping centers because operating them at high vacancy rates might still be profitable given lower property taxes and lower property maintenance bills.</p> \n\n<p>Other landlords might be compelled to improve properties, buying out leases from tenants that have fallen out of favor and renovating the vacated space. Some retailers or restaurant owners on the fence of whether to stay open might be persuaded to remain even if vacancy rates go up during the renovation period.</p> \n\n<p>\"If you buy these assets dramatically below replacement costs and become one of the lowest cost providers of real estate within a region, you can repurpose these shopping centers for alternative uses,\" said Andy Weiner, president at Houston-based real-estate investment firm RockStep Capital, which invests in shopping centers in small-town America alongside local businesses. Partners are aware of the regional and local issues and are able to identify substitute tenants such as entertainment, fitness, government offices, hospitality uses, he said.</p> \n\n<p>But it can take time.</p> \n\n<p>\"There are some places where a mall shouldn't have been built but has existed for 20 years,\" said Brian Landes, a director at real estate services firm Transwestern Commercial Services.</p> \n\n<p>Write to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.com</p> \n\n<p>(END) Dow Jones Newswires</p> \n\n<p>October 17, 2017 09:14 ET (13:14 GMT)</p>", "title": "How Some Malls Manage to Stay Alive Years After Losing Their Mojo", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2017/10/17/how-some-malls-manage-to-stay-alive-years-after-losing-their-mojo.html", "published_at": "2017-10-17", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p><a href=\"http://pienews.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Hunter.jpg\" type=\"external\" />WASHINGTON - California Republican Rep.

He breaks down crying and says he wants his family. The interrogator senses the boy is psychologically vulnerable and consults with a psychologist. The psychologist has evaluated the boy prior to the questioning and says, &#8220;Tell him his family has forgotten him.&#8221; The psychologist also prescribes &#8220;linguistic isolation&#8221; (not letting him have contact with anyone who speaks his language.) The boy attempts suicide a few weeks later. On the eve of the boy&#8217;s trial, the psychologist apparently fearing her testimony will only further implicate her, indicates she will plead the Fifth Amendment if she is called to the stand. The trial is postponed, leaving the boy in further limbo.</p> \n\n<p>The military psychologist is merely a foot soldier in psychology&#8217;s participation in torture. It goes much deeper. We now know that psychologists helped design and implement significant segments of George Bush&#8217;s torture program.&amp;#160; Despite their credo, &#8220;Above all, do no harm,&#8221; two psychologists developed instruments of psychological torture. They &#8220;reversed engineered&#8221; psychological principles. They used the very therapeutic interventions psychologists use to ameliorate psychological suffering, but &#8220;reversed&#8221; their direction to create psychological distress and instability.&amp;#160; If one&#8217;s reality sense is threatened, a good therapist validates and supports it as appropriate. In reverse engineering, the environment is deliberately made more confusing and the victim&#8217;s trust in his own perceptions is intentionally undermined.&amp;#160; In extreme form, this can ultimately drive a person to insanity from which some never come back. These were the types of techniques that were used on the seventeen-year-old detainee and others.</p> \n\n<p>Military psychologists also colluded with the Justice Department to help CIA operatives circumvent the legal prohibitions against torture. Under the Justice Department definition of torture, if a detainee was sent to a psychologist for a mental health evaluation prior to interrogation it was per se evidence that the interrogator had no legal intent to torture the detainee because the referral &#8220;demonstrated concern&#8221; for the welfare of the detainee.</p> \n\n<p>Most remarkably of all, this whole process occurred under a protective &#8220;ethical&#8221; seal from the American Psychological Association (APA), psychologists&#8217; largest national organization. The APA governance repeatedly rejected calls from its membership for APA to join other health organizations in declaring participation in Bush detention center interrogations unethical.</p> \n\n<p>Most psychologists are appalled at what the APA has done, and many, like me, have resigned from the APA. But the true story behind APA&#8217;s involvement with torture has not been fully told.</p> \n\n<p>I have had ample opportunity to observe both the inner workings of the APA and the personalities and organizational vicissitudes that have affected it over the last two decades. For most of the twenty-year period from 1983 to 2003, I either worked inside the APA central office as the first Executive Director of the APA Practice Directorate, or I served in various governance positions, including Chair of the APA Board of Professional Affairs and member of the APA Council of Representatives. Since leaving APA I have maintained a keen interest in the organization.</p> \n\n<p>The transformation of APA, in the past decade, from a historically liberal organization to an authoritarian one that actively assists in torture has been an astonishing process.&amp;#160; As with many usurpations of democratic liberal values, the transformation was accomplished by a surprisingly small number of people. APA is an invaluable case study in the psychological manipulations that influence our governmental and non-governmental institutions.</p> \n\n<p>To explain APA&#8217;s behavior two questions have to be answered. First, how did the APA develop the connections with the military that fostered the shameful role it has played in torture? Second, why did the APA governance not join other health professions in prohibiting participation in the Bush Administration&#8217;s &#8220;enhanced interrogations,&#8221; as APA&#8217;s rank and file members were demanding?</p> \n\n<p>The APA-military connection</p> \n\n<p>One source of APA&#8217;s military connections is obvious to anyone who has worked at APA over the last twenty-five years.&amp;#160; Strangely, it has been overlooked by the media. Since the early 1980&#8217;s, APA has had a unique relationship with Hawaii Senator Daniel Inouye&#8217;s office. Inouye was an honored WWII veteran, a Japanese American who himself was a medical volunteer in the midst of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. He entered office in 1962. For much of the &#8216;70s, he was Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Later he became, and is currently, the chair of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, which, of course, makes up the largest chunk of federal discretionary spending and is why economists often split discretionary government funding into defense spending versus &#8220;everything else.&#8221; This appropriations committee covers not only all of the armed forces but the CIA as well. Put succinctly, Inouye controls the military purse strings, and is very influential with military brass.</p> \n\n<p>One of Inouye&#8217;s administrative assistants, psychologist Patrick Deleon, has long been active in the APA and served a term in 2000 as APA president. For significant periods of time DeLeon has literally directed APA staff on federal policy matters and has dominated the APA governance on political matters. For over twenty-five years, relationships between the APA and the Department of Defense (DOD) have been strongly encouraged and closely coordinated by DeLeon.</p> \n\n<p>Inouye himself has served as an apologist for the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp (&#8220;Gitmo&#8221;) since the inception of the War on Terror. In a press briefing at the U.S. State Department, held shortly after his trip to Gitmo in February of 2002, Inouye affirmed Rumsfeld&#8217;s propagandist vision of the site, and then remarked:&amp;#160; &#8220;Watching our men and women treat these detainees was rather impressive. They would go out of their way to be considerate. &#8230;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>From what we know now, that is true, but not in the benevolent way Inouye implied. Inouye&#8217;s comments bore a chilling similarity to Barbara Bush&#8217;s famous comments about the alleged good fortune of Katrina victims, in the Houston Astrodome. The detainees, he said, are being treated &#8220;in some ways better than we treat our people.&#8221; (R. Burns, Associated Press, 2002). And he compared the Guantanamo climate to Hawaii&#8217;s. (It is &#8220;somewhat warmer.&#8221;)</p> \n\n<p>More significantly, it was Inouye who recently stripped the funding needed for closing Gitmo from a supplemental appropriations bill. This &#8220;Inouye Amendment,&#8221; threw a stick in the spokes of any U.S. movement away from the worst of global war on terror policies. In announcing the funding cut, Inouye&#8217;s press release was a remarkable illustration of Orwellian &#8220;newspeak,&#8221; ostensibly supporting the very opposite of what he was doing</p> \n\n<p>But let me be clear. We need to close the Guantanamo prison. Yes, it is a fine facility. I, too, have visited the site. Yes, the detainees are being well cared for. Our servicemen and servicewomen are doing great work. But the fact of the matter is Guantanamo is a symbol of the wrongdoings which have occurred, and we must eliminate that connection. (Inouye, Press Release May 20, 2009).</p> \n\n<p>DeLeon&#8217;s connection with Inouye is not by any means the only APA connection with defense interests. In 1951 the military established The Human Resource Research Organization (HumRRO) to develop techniques for &#8220;psychological warfare.&#8221; HumRRO was run by psychologist Dr. Meredith Crawford who spent ten years as APA treasurer and was deeply involved in APA activities for three decades. Crawford&#8217;s former student, Raymond Fowler, became Chief Executive Officer of APA in 1989 and stayed in that position until 2003. Today, fifty-five percent of HumRRO&#8217;s budget comes from the military.</p> \n\n<p>As CEO, Fowler hired his two most important lieutenants from HumRRO, Chief Financial Officer, Charles &#8220;Jack&#8221; McKay, and in-house attorney, James McHugh. Both men have now, after lengthy APA tenures, left the APA and returned to HumRRO in &amp;#160;very senior roles. McHugh is Chairman of the HumRRO Board of Trustees and McKay is Vice-Chairman and Treasurer. The current President of HumRRO, psychologist William Strickland, has been an outspoken supporter of APA&#8217;s policies on the torture issue. He served on the APA Council of Representatives throughout the APA deliberations on torture.</p> \n\n<p>Whether and how the longstanding relationships and frequent circulation of key personnel between APA and HumRRO positions have shaped APA&#8217;s involvement with the military is unclear, but given recent events, it certainly warrants more careful scrutiny than it has received from psychologists. In fact, I do not believe many psychologists are even aware of these relationships.</p> \n\n<p>Regardless of HumRRO&#8217;s role, however, as psychologists, most APA governance members have little Washington political experience. For them, Patrick DeLeon, because of his connection with Inouye, is perceived as a canny psychology politician and political force on Capitol Hill. Regardless of the accuracy of that perception, I have no reason to think DeLeon is a corrupt or evil person. Instead, from my perspective, the most interesting aspect of DeLeon has always been his apparent preoccupation with issues of status for psychologists, irrespective of the issues&#8217; actual significance either for psychologists or the public.</p> \n\n<p>DeLeon wanted to make sure a psychologist, not just physicians, for example, would be eligible to fill this or that position in the Veteran&#8217;s Administration, and he campaigned for years for VA psychologists to receive a minuscule pay increase when they became board certified. On the whole, I found these matters harmless and of at least some marginal benefit to people. Using funding from the Department of Defense he has also launched a campaign for psychologists to be given legal rights to prescribe psychiatric medications.</p> \n\n<p>The torture issue is, of course, quite different. Viewed through the eyes of DeLeon&#8217;s adherents, psychology&#8217;s new found role as architects of a central component of the war on terror was a tremendous &#8220;victory&#8221; for the field of psychology. That it involved torture was peripheral, obscured by the headiness of being involved in high-level, important, clandestine government affairs. In discussions about APA&#8217;s role in the interrogations, a senior member of the APA governance described himself as &#8220;addicted&#8221; to the television show 24. Now he had his own reality TV show.</p> \n\n<p>DeLeon&#8217;s influence in the APA and with many individual psychologists, especially those from Hawaii, came in very handy for Inouye in his efforts to support the Department of Defense.&amp;#160; When the military needed a mental health professional to help implement its interrogation procedures, and the other professions subsequently refused to comply, the military had a friend in Senator Inouye&#8217;s office, one that could reap the political dividends of seeds sown by DeLeon over many years.</p> \n\n<p>While we are only now uncovering the names of the individuals who participated most directly in the interrogations, I think a surprising number of them will turn out to be people brought into the military through Inouye&#8217;s office, many by DeLeon himself.</p> \n\n<p>APA&#8217;s Organizational Decline</p> \n\n<p>But this leads to the second and more complex question. Why did the governance of the APA let this happen under the apparent imprimatur of the world&#8217;s largest organization of psychologists? Some people assume APA&#8217;s horrifying recent behavior involved large sums of money changing hands. I could certainly be wrong, but I think the more likely (and more remarkable and pressing) mechanism has little to do with money.&amp;#160; For reasons described below, the APA leaders who were making these decisions simply exercised judgment that was both bad and insensitive to the realities of human suffering. In my opinion, schooled by 25 years of experience with the APA, it was neither greed nor financial corruption that brought the APA governance into alliance with the Bush Administration. Instead, it was a malignant organizational grandiosity that first weakened the APA and then, ultimately, allowed military and intelligence agencies to have their way with the APA throughout the Bush Administration.</p> \n\n<p>But how did the APA, of all organizations, get this way? What led to this grandiose culture? An organization does not rise or fall with a single event any more than the fall of Rome truly occurred in 476 AD.&amp;#160; The culture of grandiosity was carefully cultivated for more than a decade by a few self-interested individuals.</p> \n\n<p>What has been observable and unarguable about the APA of recent years is that the pluralistic and multi-faceted governance process I witnessed when first entering the APA in the early 1980&#8217;s was sharply curtailed during the 1990&#8217;s. Differences of opinion disappeared, and the APA suffered a terrible organizational decline. Increasingly inbred and infantilized under the tightly controlled administration of Raymond Fowler, the association agenda was primarily and at times exclusively financial, focused on making money either through real estate ventures or through what I and others felt was the unnecessarily harsh financial treatment of lower level APA employees.</p> \n\n<p>Whatever one&#8217;s view of APA, few can dispute that Fowler, more than any other individual, made APA what it is today. The CEO of APA for almost fifteen years, Fowler served in one capacity or another on the APA Board of Directors for twenty-five consecutive years. While his supporters would characterize him as &#8220;astute&#8221; and his critics as &#8220;devious,&#8221; few could reasonably disagree that Fowler was the main mover in the APA for the fifteen years leading up to the torture debacle.</p> \n\n<p>Most peculiarly, Fowler&#8217;s &#8220;agenda&#8221; for APA was encapsulated in the phrase &#8220;Working Together,&#8221; a noble idea that to the best of my knowledge was never attached to any actual substantive agenda. Instead, it served as a means of social control, a subtle injunction against raising any of the conflict-laden issues, challenges, or ideas that need to be addressed in any vital and accountable organization. The governance of the APA became either conformist or placid and increasingly detached from the real world.</p> \n\n<p>The result was that much of the activity of the APA Council of Representatives, the legislative group with ultimate authority in the APA governance, turned away from substantive matters into an odd system of fawning over one another. Many members appeared to simply bathe in the good feeling that came from &#8220;working together.&#8221; The bath was characterized by grandiose self-referents and shared lofty opinions of one another. As it became more and more detached from reality, the organizational dysfunction became more pronounced, but this was ignored and obscured by the self-congratulatory organizational style. During this period, isolated dissent from rank-and-file members was stifled with a heavy-handed letter from the APA attorney threatening legal action or by communications from prominent members of the APA governance threatening &#8220;ethics&#8221; charges if policy protests were not discontinued. (It is unethical for psychologists to lie, and I can attest that one former APA president concluded that disagreeing with him was per se &#8220;lying.&#8221;)</p> \n\n<p>Deliberations on Torture</p> \n\n<p>This same grandiosity was ubiquitous in the governance&#8217;s rhetoric at the heart of the Association&#8217;s discussions on torture. Banning psychologists&#8217; participation in reputed torture mills was clearly unnecessary, proponents of the APA policy argued.&amp;#160; To do so would be an &#8220;insult&#8221; to military psychologists everywhere. No psychologist would ever engage in torture. Insisting on a change in APA policy reflected a mean-spirited attitude toward the military psychologists. The supporters of the APA policy managed to transform the military into the victims in the interrogation issue.</p> \n\n<p>In the end, however, it was psychologists&#8217; self-assumed importance that carried the day on the torture issue. Psychologists&#8217; participation in these detention centers, it was asserted, was an antidote to torture, since psychologists&#8217; very presence could protect the potential torture victims (presumably from Rumsfeld and Cheney, no less!). The debates on the APA Council floor, year after year, concluded with the general consensus that, indeed, psychology was very, very important to our nation&#8217;s security.</p> \n\n<p>We psychologists were both too good and too important to join our professional colleagues in other professions who were taking an absolutist moral position against one of the most shameful eras in our country&#8217;s history. While the matter was clearly orchestrated by others, it was this self-reinforcing grandiosity that led the traditionally liberal APA governance down the slippery slope to the Bush Administration&#8217;s torture program.</p> \n\n<p>During this period I had numerous personal communications with members of the APA governance structure in an attempt to dissuade them from ignoring the rank-and-file psychologists who abhorred the APA&#8217;s position.&amp;#160; I have been involved in many policy disagreements over the course of my career, but the smugness and illogic that characterized the response to these efforts were astonishing and went far beyond normal, even heated, give and take. Most dramatically, the intelligence that I have always found to characterize the profession of psychology was sorely lacking.</p> \n\n<p>Outside the self-absorbed culture of the current APA governance, to the rest of the world, the APA arguments simply do not pass the red-face test for credibility. Instead, their transparent disingenuousness only made the APA sound embarrassingly like apologists for the Bush Administration.</p> \n\n<p>The Conclusion</p> \n\n<p>The inability to deliberate rationally on the torture issue was but the tragic denouement of an organizational process that was actually set in motion in the early 1990&#8217;s, largely to serve the convenience of a very small number of individuals. As a result of the management style of the 90&#8217;s, the governance of APA was ill prepared for thoughtful deliberation on a matter as important as the torture issue. The governance was simply over its head in trying to effectively address such a socially and ethically consequential issue. This was especially true in a debate in which one side had organized support from powerful military interests, then-current APA presidents like Gerald Koocher and Ronald Levant, and Senator Inouye&#8217;s office all pushing for APA involvement in the interrogations. Few people stood up to them, and those who did were people who were inexperienced in the duplicity and manipulative style of politics that characterized APA.</p> \n\n<p>With the increasing uproar from the membership and the media, APA&#8217;s more recently elected leaders and the current CEO, Norman Anderson, have been extraordinarily quiet on the subject of psychologist and APA involvement in the torture issue. Instead, second level APA employees have been put out front to defend the APA position to the membership and to the public. These are almost exclusively people hired by Fowler to fit into his carefully designed model of an organization that would be controllable, if somewhat non-dynamic and uncreative. Thus, the public relations staff Fowler hired, the staff legal and psychological expertise he hired, and most remarkably his ethics director have all served as the &#8220;face of APA&#8221; on the torture issue in recent years. Not surprisingly, forced to function under the watchful eye of the public they have not acquitted themselves in credible fashion.</p> \n\n<p>In a recent book, I used several organizational examples to illustrate that many of the same techniques of political manipulation used in the Bush Administration were used in other organizational settings. Many of those examples were drawn from the APA. At the time of writing I never dreamed the techniques would lead to APA&#8217;s complicity in torture.</p> \n\n<p>But such is the fate of a regressed and chronically manipulated organization. Despite being an organization of psychologists, APA has been subjected to considerable manipulation but to very little analysis. The people who run APA have &#8220;reverse engineered&#8221; the very field of psychology itself and used it against its own membership.</p> \n\n<p>Psychologists are amongst the most moral and ethical people I know. They deserved better from their national organization, just as Americans throughout that same era deserved better from their government.</p> \n\n<p>Bryant Welch is a clinical psychologist and attorney living in Hilton Head, SC.&amp;#160; He is the author of <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">State of Confusion: Political Manipulation and the Assault on the American Mind,</a> St. Martins Press, 2008.)</p>", "title": "Torture, Psychology and Sen.

Source: Time Warner</p> \n\n<p>Time Warner has a lot riding on the success of its latest blockbuster, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The film, which will make its theatrical debut on Friday, pits two of DC Comics' most iconic characters against each other.With a production budget of $250 million, Time Warner has a lot invested in the film. But there is more to it than just a single film: Batman v Superman is intended to be the opening salvo in a long-running initiative that will shape its business for years to come.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>It's somewhat troubling, then, that the film has been so poorly received by critics. It remains to be seen how well the film will ultimately perform at the box office this weekend, but this is a development that should concern Time Warner shareholders.</p> \n\n<p>A rotten receptionWhen it comes to movies, Rotten Tomatoes is perhaps the most well-regarded review aggregator. The site compiles the views of dozens of professional critics to assess the relative quality of a given film. Individual reviews are labeled either rotten (bad) or fresh (good), and the number of each is compared in order to award a composite score.A film with a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes indicates that every single critic surveyed enjoyed the film, while a score of 0% means no one liked it.</p> \n\n<p>Currently, <a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_v_superman_dawn_of_justice/#contentReviews\" type=\"external\">Rotten Tomatoes</a> has surveyed 167 different critics and from their reviews, has awarded the film a meager 31%. Among top critics -- those who write for more reputable publications, such as The New York Times -- the reception has been even worse as just 29% enjoyed the film.</p> \n\n<p>By comparison, Walt Disney's first superhero crossover film, The Avengers, garnered an impressive 92% rating. Its sequel scored lower with just 75%, but that was still enough to receive Rotten Tomatoes' \"certified fresh\" designation. Other recent Marvel movies, including Ant-Man, Iron Man 3, Thor, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Captain America: The First Avenger have allmanaged to land scores of 75% or greater.</p> \n\n<p>Critics have taken issue with Batman v Superman's pacing; its messy, humorless plot; and its tendency to shoehorn references to future DC films. <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/us/film/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice\" type=\"external\">TimeOut's</a> Joshua Rothkopf used particularly colorful language, labeling it a \"a $250 million tombstone\".A.O. Scott of called the film a \"cynical cash grab\".</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>But does any of that actually matter? Are audiences swayed by critical response?</p> \n\n<p>Critical favorites -- the sort of films that regularly dominate the Academy Awards -- are rarely big budget success stories. Still, there does seem to be some correlation between strong reviews and ticket sales. Of the top 10 highest-grossing films of all time, every single one scored at least 72% or better on Rotten Tomatoes. Brendan Bettinger, writing for <a href=\"http://collider.com/box-office-reviews-statistics/\" type=\"external\">Collider</a> back in 2012, looked at the major films released in 2011 and found that strong Rotten Tomatoes scores do correlate with box office success.</p> \n\n<p>Building an extended universeNevertheless, Batman v Superman is unlikely to bomb. Warner Bros. has been marketing the film aggressively for most of the last two years, building anticipation for its release. According to <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2016/03/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-global-box-office-opening-1201723873/\" type=\"external\">Deadline</a>, the film could generate $350 million in its debut.</p> \n\n<p>The risk for Time Warner is that, even if audiences are willing to see it, they may not return. In August, Time Warner will release its second major DC crossover, Suicide Squad, followed by Wonder Woman and Justice League films in 2017. Other DC superheroes, including The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg are slated to receive their own movies in the years to come. If audiences find it just as distasteful as critics, they may lose their appetite for additional DC entries.</p> \n\n<p>That could affect other portions of Time Warner's business. The company has been infusing its Turner cable networks with new series featuring DC characters, such as The Flash and Teen Titans Go. Its premium cable network offers its Warner Bros. films to subscribers, and since <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/22/can-you-guess-what-hbo-subscribers-spend-most-of-t.aspx?source=eptfxblnk0000004\" type=\"external\">movies are a big part of HBO's draw</a>, strong demand for DC films could lead to more HBO subscriptions.</p> \n\n<p>Warner Bros. has expanded into video games in recent years and utilizes the intellectual property of its films to attract gamers to major releases. Video games based on Batman v Superman and other DC properties should form the basis of much of Time Warner's video game output in the quarters to come, and if the films themselves capture little interest, gamers may be similarly unaffected.</p> \n\n<p>Likewise, box office underperformance could weigh on Time Warner's aspirations for consumer products. In November, CEO Jeff Bewkes noted that the company was hoping to leverage DC success to sell merchandise. \"The next stage of growth for DC will be in film, which is also a critical driver in our plans to further expand our consumer products business,\" he said.</p> \n\n<p>To be fair, there's more to Warner Bros. than DC Comics -- the company will reenter the world of Harry Potter with Fantastical Beasts in November -- and perhaps audiences will find the movie far more favorable than critics. Still, its poor critical reception is not an encouraging sign by any means.</p> \n\n<p>The article <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/24/batman-v-superman-time-warner-incs-250-million-tom.aspx\" type=\"external\">\"Batman v Superman\": Time Warner Inc's $250 Million Tombstone?</a> originally appeared on Fool.com.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFMattera/info.aspx?source=eptfxblnk0000004\" type=\"external\">Sam Mattera</a> has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Conversely, the closer you get to Philadelphia, the more strained and skittish the coverage, if developments get covered at all,&#8221; Lindorff stated during a recent interview.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The latest news development in the case, which is really quite dramatic and important for several reasons, provides a case study in local media gutlessness,&#8221; Lindorff noted.</p> \n\n<p>So, what is news?</p> \n\n<p>Well, Philly print and broadcast mainstream news media could have &#8216;discovered&#8217; news in the fact that Abu-Jamal&#8217;s main support group&#8211;based in Philadelphia&#8211;immediately posted Lindorff&#8217;s article on the court order on its web site.</p> \n\n<p>How is that news?</p> \n\n<p>Well, many of Abu-Jamal&#8217;s staunchest supporters&#8211;including the Philly based group&#8211;have trashed Lindorff&#8217;s meticulously researched book, damning it as too objective in part for its failings to exude the hero-worship posture they desire.</p> \n\n<p>The web based Counterpunch and Salon.com posted Lindorff&#8217;s articles on the order.</p> \n\n<p>On a more substantial matter, Philly&#8217;s news media could have found news in the fact that twice this year, the Third Circuit granted relief in Philadelphia murder cases on the issue of prosecution discrimination in jury selection&#8211;one of the appeal points in last week&#8217;s Abu-Jamal order.</p> \n\n<p>One of these two rulings occurred in mid-October.</p> \n\n<p>These rulings, and others on this legal point since the mid- 1980s, expose a pattern of jury discrimination practices by Philadelphia prosecutors that bracket Abu-Jamal&#8217;s heavily criticized 1982 trial. An Amnesty International report on Abu- Jamal&#8217;s case described that &#8217;82 trial as &#8220;deeply flawed&#8221; failing to meet &#8220;international standards for a fair trial.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Evidence cited by Philadelphia based federal judges when voiding jury discrimination tainted murder convictions includes notes prosecutors kept on the race of potential jury members and a videotaped training session where a veteran prosecutor instructed rookie prosecutors on how to craftily rid juries of non- whites and whites living in racially integrated, liberal communities of Philadelphia.</p> \n\n<p>In 1991, the Inquirer ran articles on Charles Diggs and Harold McKendrick, after local federal judges voided their respective murder convictions due to jury selection bias by Philly prosecutors.</p> \n\n<p>These articles ran during a period when local media ignored discriminatory US Supreme Court actions refusing to grant Abu- Jamal relief on the same constitutional protection that Court was giving two convicted murderers: a white racist prison gang member and a white devil worshiper.</p> \n\n<p>Email exchanges immediately after issuance of the Third Circuit&#8217;s order provide a window into the news decision making at the Inquirer and Daily News.</p> \n\n<p>An Inquirer staffer deemed the court order &#8220;a procedural development that is notenough to warrant a story.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>A Daily News staffer stated &#8220;the evaluation of our reporters, editors and lawyer [is] that this is NOT a big deal&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Well, there you have it&#8211;go figure?</p> \n\n<p>Linn Washington Jr. a journalism professor at Temple University, has covered the Abu-Jamal case since December 1981.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "The Philly Media and Mumia Abu-Jamal", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2005/12/10/the-philly-media-and-mumia-abu-jamal/", "published_at": "2005-12-10", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Toledo mayoral candidate Opal Covey, who has warned that <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">God will destroy her city</a> if she isn&#8217;t elected, has been interviewed by <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/news/a39201/opal-covey-toledo-mayor-candidate-prophet-exorcist/\" type=\"external\">Esquire</a>.

Harrington is a forgotten name to many, though there was a time when he was a big name in American letters. His academic specialty was American diplomatic history, which he taught at University of Wisconsin before becoming that school&#8217;s president in 1962. His writings, including his 1935 MISSISSIPPI VALLEY HISTORICAL REVIEW essay &#8220;The Anti-Imperialists: Too Few, Too Feeble&#8221;, shaped men such as William A. Williams and others who comprised the &#8220;Wisconsin School&#8221; of diplomatic history.</p> \n\n<p>Why does a 1935 discussion of those who opposed US Imperialism between 1898 and 2000 matter today? Because, as I type this, plans are being made for US military action throughout the world. Perhaps because those plans are lower-profile than the run-up to the recent liberation, the masses aren&#8217;t thronged in the streets, protesting the Pentagon&#8217;s systemic destruction of strategically-positioned, mineral-rich cultures.</p> \n\n<p>The danger in protesting the Iraqi war as if it were a singular action cannot be understated. Even if the invasion of Iraq had been &#8220;stopped&#8221; &#8212; neglected is the contention that the 1991 hostilities had never actually ended &#8212; what really would have changed in the Pentagon? We&#8217;d still have Rumsfeld spinning some delightfully dadaist swill about &#8220;the unknowable&#8221;, and there would still be &#8220;total information awareness&#8221;, and Washington would still be leveraging itself out to support its military-socialism habit. They would still, like needle junkies, search for veins to tap and rationales to support their actions.</p> \n\n<p>And we who hate their wars and their fatuous rationales, in all likelihood, would fare no better than those who opposed aggression upon Spanish holdings. As Harrington asserts, &#8220;in approaching the anti-imperialist movement, it is well to bear in mind that it was based almost exclusively on grounds of abstract political principle. The anti-imperialists did not oppose colonial expansion for commercial, religious, or constitutional&#8221; reasons, but because they felt &#8220;expansion&#8221; ran counter to the principles in which the United States government finds its rhetorical ballast, or &#8220;legitimacy&#8221;. Government by, for, and about the people, in other words.</p> \n\n<p>With the advantage of hindsight, it can be argued that the more internationalist anti-war protesters in the most recent case would&#8217;ve been better served by recycling the words and ideas of William Jennings Bryan, who saw aggression against Spain as an attempt to destroy &#8220;that self-evident truth that governments derive their just powers, not from superior force, but from the consent of the governed.&#8221; Or Grover Cleveland, some guy in the White House between Lincoln and FDR, who likened colonial aggrandizement to the abandonment of old landmarks.</p> \n\n<p>History has proven right those who saw aggression against Spain as a prelude to &#8220;perpetual war for perpetual peace&#8221; [to borrow a fashionable phrase.] At this point, the military is ensconced in public life to a degree unimaginable to those whose &#8220;presidents&#8221; aren&#8217;t former generals. One of the greater utilities of Harrington&#8217;s essay is how it outlines the broad spectrum of opposition to the war, united in defense of the twained fates of anti-interventionism and national sovereignty. Andrew Carnegie opposed the wars, as did leaders of domestic agricultural concerns that would be threatened by cheap Filipino imports. And, as Harrington puts it, &#8220;the political elements represented in the movement fall into four distinct groups &#8212; the independents, the Gold democrats, the Bryan Democrats, and the regular Republicans,&#8221; including former President Harrison.</p> \n\n<p>With such a broad coalition of support, why did the 1890s anti-Imperialist movement fail? Harrington attributes their lack of success to the extremity of their views and rhetoric, which ran counter to &#8220;the people being stirred by the thought of distant possessions,&#8221; a fervor that cooled with time. Harrington claims also that the &#8220;anti-imperialists were handicapped by the nature of their cause. They were forced to preach abnegation rather than indulgence, to urge the pride of renunciation as against the pride of glory and possession.&#8221; A brilliant point, and again, it&#8217;s applicable to the opposition of the recent cakewalk.</p> \n\n<p>But Harrington saves his most trenchant criticism of those who opposed foreign wars for his conclusion. &#8220;Most tragic of all&#8221;, he writes, &#8220;was the failure to unite in support of a political leader. The majority of the great anti-imperialists showed no disposition to head a great protest movement. The one available champion of the cause,&#8221; the discredited William Jennings Bryan, &#8220;was absolutely unacceptable to many anti-imperialists. Men found themselves apologizing rather than fighting for the standard bearer for their cause.&#8221; Jesse, Ramsey, call your offices.</p> \n\n<p>One can&#8217;t help but hear the echoes of mainstream opponents of the war scuttling to distance themselves from such as the International ANSWER apparatus. Harrington could&#8217;ve predicted such an end to an anti-war movement, &#8220;a great crusade without crusaders.&#8221; Those who opposed taking Spain on, the historian writes, &#8220;wavered every time they met the enemy&#8221; war machine and &#8220;suffered a rout from which they&#8221; &#8212; and the nation itself &#8212; &#8220;from which they would never recover.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>ANTHONY GANCARSKI is a regular CounterPunch columnist.

But as a long-time citizen of New York City, I&#8217;m all too aware of the weaponization of grief. The outpouring of no-context, ahistorical sympathy after 9/11 helped pave the way for a violent reaction that killed in Iraq alone roughly <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001533\" type=\"external\">150 times as many people</a> as died in Lower Manhattan&amp;#160; that day&#8212;an opportunistic catastrophe that did more to mock than avenge those deaths.</p> \n\n<p>Just as the question of Al-Qaeda&#8217;s motives in 2001 provoked more self-congratulation than serious inquiry (Extra! Update, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">10/01</a>), coverage of Paris in 2015 tends to skirt over political realities. Thus the New York Times ( <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/14/world/europe/paris-terror-attack.html\" type=\"external\">11/13/15</a>) could report: &#8220;A stunned and confused French capital was again left to wonder: Why us?

By last summer, Western airstrikes against ISIS in both Iraq and Syria had reportedly killed at least 459 civilians, including more than 100 children (Guardian, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/03/us-led-air-strikes-on-isis-targets-killed-more-than-450-civilians-report\" type=\"external\">8/3/15</a>).</p> \n\n<p>Nor does the piece asking &#8220;why us?&#8221; mention that France has been &#8220;the most prominent backer of Syria&#8217;s armed opposition&#8221; (Guardian, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/07/france-funding-syrian-rebels\" type=\"external\">12/7/12</a>), giving funds to rebels trying to overthrow the Damascus government as early as 2012. When ISIS took advantage of the Syrian civil war to occupy large portions of the country, France doubled down by sending weapons directly to&amp;#160; insurgents, with President Fran&#231;ois Hollande saying that &#8220;we should not stop the support that we have given to these rebels who are the only ones to take part in the democratic process&#8221; just because such support had helped the apocalyptic ISIS movement to thrive (AFP, <a href=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20140821-france-arms-syria-rebels-hollande\" type=\"external\">8/21/14</a>).</p> \n\n<p>Photo accompanying New York Times article about French President Fran&#231;ois Hollande describing the Paris attacks as an &#8220;act of war.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>None of this background was&amp;#160; explained when the New York Times ( <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/live/paris-attacks-live-updates/french-leader-calls-attacks-an-act-of-war-and-says-isis-to-blame/\" type=\"external\">11/14/15</a>) reported Hollande&#8217;s assertion that the attacks in Paris were &#8220;an act of war,&#8221; as though France hadn&#8217;t long been making war on ISIS, and repeated without context his claim (using an Arabic acronym for ISIS) that &#8220;France, because it was foully, disgracefully and violently attacked, will be unforgiving with the barbarians from Daesh.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Noting that France&#8217;s enthusiasm for military intervention in the Middle East long predated the Paris attacks puts one at risk of being mistaken for an apologist for ISIS war crimes. Indeed, one suspects that fear of such misidentification leads journalists to downplay or omit French violence in describing the context of the attacks.

We have a one-party system, and the media is the other party.</p> \n\n<p>STELTER: You're talking about editorial people, though, people that write opinion columnists for a living. \"The New York Times\"' reporting staff has been breaking stories left and right, holding Trump accountable.

What&#8217;s more, of those bickering couples, 38% say they don&#8217;t resolve the issues in a mutually-agreeable manner.</p> \n\n<p>Oerbuch says talking about money is still considered taboo because parents don&#8217;t discuss financial planning, salaries and budgeting with their kids, so we grow up without the models and vocabulary to approach the topic.</p> \n\n<p>In fact, she says people are more likely to talk about sex then money. &#8220;When couples, girlfriends or a group of guys get together, they are more likely to approach the topic of sex than they are about money. That is the reason couples have the notion that money causes problems.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>To help spur a financial conversation, experts suggest asking the following questions:</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Question No.1: What Does Money Mean to You? Oerbuch suggests individuals ask themselves this question first to identify their relationship with money. &#8220;What did it represent when growing up? Was it a status thing? Comfort? Security?&#8221; She says how our parents budgeted and talked about money impacts how we handle our finances as an adult.</p> \n\n<p>Once each person determines their money priorities, it&#8217;s easier to create a financial plan that takes into account both perspectives. &#8220;Knowing the other person&#8217;s general philosophies and whether they are a spendthrift or more frugal is important; you don&#8217;t necessarily have to match, but you need to know where the other is coming from,&#8221; says Mark VandeVelde, certified financial planner and wealth partner at Hefty Wealth Partners.</p> \n\n<p>Question No.2: When Should We Discuss Money? Talking about money in a neutral setting makes the conversation more productive and less likely to lead to a fight.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Most of the time, couples only address money issues when a credit card bill is overdue, &amp;#160;someone lost their job or blew the budget, which is just asking for a fight,&#8221; says Oerbuch.</p> \n\n<p>She recommends couples discuss their finances every three months in a neutral setting.</p> \n\n<p>Question No.3: How Will We Make Financial Decisions? It&#8217;s common for one person to take the lead in managing the finances, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the other person should remain completely out of the loop.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It should never be 100% one-sided with who is charge,&#8221; says VandeVelde. &#8220;Not only can that lead to resentment, it can also lead to major problems if something were to happen to the spouse controlling the money.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>According to Fidelity, more than one-third of Americans do not know where important financial and legal documents are stored.</p> \n\n<p>Oerbuch says some couples set &#8220;spending thresholds&#8221; that determine when the other person needs to give approval before making a purchase. &amp;#160;&#8220;You need to have the notion of when the other person should be consulted when making a purchase.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Having a threshold can help reduce blown budgets and hurt feelings. &#8220;Whether it&#8217;s your daily Starbucks habit or a brand-new TV set, you need to know if you have to call the other person to make sure it&#8217;s a joint decision.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Question No.4: What are Your Long-Term Goals?&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>VandeVelde stresses that a couple doesn&#8217;t have to have the same goals, but everyone needs to be aware of their partner&#8217;s wishes to form a financial plan.</p> \n\n<p>According to the Fidelity survey, 4 in 10 working couples disagree on the lifestyle they expect in retirement, which can make creating a savings plan difficult.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;As long as you understand the goals and are OK with not being on the same page you can create the right plan, whether it&#8217;s keeping money separate, creating two accounts or keeping all the money together, the key is to understand everyone&#8217;s end goal.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Lauren Brouhard, senior vice president, marketing strategy and business management at Fidelity, says 50% of couples don&#8217;t have the same top financial concern. &#8220;If the topic becomes too heated, bring in a third party to help take the emotion out.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>VandeVelde advises new couples ask about the other&#8217;s desire to have kids or own a home. &#8220;If they aren&#8217;t on the same page it&#8217;s hard to create a long-term savings plan that is going to work.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Question No. 6: How Much Debt Do You Have? &amp;#160;In the era of record student loan debt levels and mounting outstanding credit card bills, VandeVelde says it&#8217;s important to have a grasp on the other person&#8217;s debt situation.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Ask about any debt and their repayment plan. Knowing this early in a relationship can avoid &amp;#160;any surprises later.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Question No.6: Is this Argument Really About Money?&amp;#160; Sometimes financial conflicts really have nothing to do with money, Oerbuch says.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Money is tangible and easy to transfer to others issues. Sometimes what you are arguing about really has nothing to do with money and it&#8217;s important to take a step back and realize that there is a deeper issue here.&#8221;</p>", "title": "6 Money Questions Every Couple Needs to Ask Now", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2014/02/14/6-money-questions-every-couple-needs-to-ask-now.html", "published_at": "2016-03-06", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>&#8220;The bulwark against tyranny is the First Amendment,\" declared Tucker Carlson during an interview on Monday with Alex Jones for Infowars.</p> \n\n<p>Describing the right to keep and bear arms as an emergency measure built into the Constitution by its framers, Carlson implied that the First and Second Amendments were inseparable from one another.</p> \n\n<p>Lamenting the weaker protections for free speech and expression across the Anglosphere and broader Western World, Carlson criticixed the criminalization of \"hate speech\" in Canada, the UK, Australia, France, and Germany.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Our closest allies don&#8217;t recognize the First Amendment,&#8221; said Carlson, adding that the First Amendment&#8217;s protections were immutable and &#8220;written in stone.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the line?

There are some very good things going on at the oil and natural gas giant, too. But before you buy, you have to step back and look at the big picture. If you don't, you could end up owning something you didn't expect. Here are three terrible reasons to buy Royal Dutch Shell.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>OK, let's be honest, the big yield is a great reason to buy Shell. But not without putting it into context. For example, Shell hasn't increased its dividend in three years. In fact, in an effort to protect cash flow, the company is offering a scrip dividend, which pays shareholders in stock so it doesn't have to pay in cash.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Royal Dutch Shell plc.</p> \n\n<p>This relates back to the steep decline in oil prices in mid-2014, but the roughly $50 billion acquisition of BG Group last year is another important factor. That move increased the company's long-term debt by more than 50% between year-end 2015 and year-end 2016. Shell is now planning on selling $30 billion worth of assets to get its balance sheet back in order.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>In other words, Shell has a big yield, but there are risks you have to understand before you jump aboard. I believe it will be able to hold the line on the dividend, but until the balance sheet is in better shape, dividend increases, at least material ones, are probably on hold.</p> \n\n<p>Another thing you have to understand about Shell is that it's not your typical oil major... at least not after the BG acquisition. That's not to suggest that oil isn't important to Shell; it's still a major part of the business and an important growth engine for the company. But BG was a natural gas-focused company and a big reason Shell bought it was to make a strategic shift toward that fuel. And, to be honest, Shell was already among the largest players in the natural gas space, notably including liquified natural gas (which is how the fuel is transported when pipelines aren't an option).</p> \n\n<p>The BG acquisition made Shell an even bigger player in natural gas. Image source: Royal Dutch Shell plc.</p> \n\n<p>This is a long-term shift toward a fuel that is expected to foster the transition from carbon fuels to clean power, like solar and wind. Strategically, it's a solid decision and helps to underpin the company's growth plans, but you can't buy Shell thinking that it's just an oil company. Because it's increasingly looking like a natural gas company, too.</p> \n\n<p>Despite a long and successful operating history, Shell is a commodity company. That said, oil prices have bounced back from their early 2016 lows, which may lead some investors to call an all-clear. After all, if the pickup in drilling in the United States is any indication, things are looking up for energy companies. Some perspective is needed.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://ycharts.com/indicators/brent_crude_oil_spot_price\" type=\"external\">Brent Crude Oil Spot Price</a> data by <a href=\"http://ycharts.com\" type=\"external\">YCharts Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Indeed, while oil prices have come off their lows, they remain far below the highs reached in 2014. And natural gas continues to trade at a relatively low price, historically speaking. That means there's not going to be a return to the salad days anytime soon. And the U.S. oil and gas activity could actually be part of the problem, as production here is flexible enough to ramp up and down quickly. Which is why U.S. onshore activity is expected to restrain energy prices. A new normal with lower energy prices is more likely than a steady rise at this point, limiting upside in Shell's earnings.</p> \n\n<p>There are a lot of good reasons to like Shell, including its push toward natural gas and debt repayment efforts. However, you have to understand the impact of these moves, as well as the bigger picture for the energy industry, where $100-per-barrel oil prices appear to be a thing of the past for now. As long as you have the bigger picture in focus, Shell is a solid option for dividend investors.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than Royal Dutch Shell (B Shares)When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It also approved a $73.6 million direct loan to a wind farm in Uruguay, which is owned by Abengoa.</p> \n\n<p>Former Democratic New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson sits on both the Abengoa International Advisory Board and is <a href=\"http://www.exim.gov/about/whoweare/leadership/advisory-committee.cfm\" type=\"external\">currently listed</a> on the Ex-Im bank&#8217;s website as a member of the advisory committee that helps guide bank policy.</p> \n\n<p>Richardson was not listed in the Ex-Im Bank&#8217;s November <a href=\"http://www.exim.gov/newsandevents/releases/2012/Ex-Im-Bank-Announces-FY2013-Advisory-Committee-Members.cfm\" type=\"external\">announcement</a> of its 2013 Advisory Board members.</p> \n\n<p>\"Mr. Richardson had no role or communication with anyone in the Bank regarding that transaction,\" said a spokesman for the Ex-Im Bank. \"His appointment to the Advisory Board was made public only after he had been fully vetted by the Bank, which occurred after the initial press release was issued.\"</p> \n\n<p>It is unclear, though, if Richardson joined the Ex-Im Bank&#8217;s advisory board before or after the decision to extend the loan was made. The Ex-Im Bank did not immediately respond to a follow-up inquiry.</p> \n\n<p>Critics of the Ex-Im Bank say the connection between Richardson, Abengoa, and the bank is another instance of \"corporate welfare\" at the bank.</p> \n\n<p>\"The Export-Import Bank is nothing more than a massive, taxpayer-backed fund for corporate welfare, so a story like this comes at no surprise to us or to anyone who has pushed for the bank to be shut down,\" said Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller.</p> \n\n<p>The Club for Growth is one of several small-government groups that opposed the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank last year. The reauthorization bill raised the limit on the total financing the bank can guarantee borrowers from $100&amp;#160;billion to $140&amp;#160;billion.</p> \n\n<p>The groups, along with several conservative members of Congress, oppose the bank on the grounds that it favors large, politically connected companies and distorts markets.</p> \n\n<p>However, supporters of the bank say it encourages U.S. exports and supports American jobs.</p> \n\n<p>The Ex-Im Bank, which extends taxpayer-backed loans to foreign buyers of U.S. exports, estimates approximately 510 American jobs will be supported by the Abengoa transactions.</p> \n\n<p>\"These two transactions demonstrate the strength of American energy technology&amp;#160;and highlight the importance of this growing sector,\" Ex-Im Bank Chairman and President Fred P. Hochberg said in a statement.&amp;#160;\"In order for the U.S. to compete globally, our companies must continue to produce cutting-edge energy technology. President Obama set an ambitious goal of doubling U.S. exports in five years, and these types of projects will help us meet that goal in 2015.\"</p> \n\n<p>As previously reported by the Washington Free Beacon, Abengoa has garnered a wealth of federal subsidies and preferential treatment from the Obama administration, such as <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">fast-tracked leasing</a> from the Interior Department for its solar farms and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">loans</a> worth $2.78 billion from the Energy and Treasury Department.</p> \n\n<p>The jobs created from these loans were projected to create 195 permanent jobs at a rate of more than $14 million per job.</p> \n\n<p>Abengoa&#8217;s American green energy projects&#8212;Solana, Movjave Solar, and Abengoa Bioenergy Biomass of Kansas LLC&#8212;all had <a href=\"http://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/FINAL-DOE-Loan-Guarantees-Report.pdf\" type=\"external\">low credit ratings</a> but were still approved for significant DOE loans.</p> \n\n<p>Solana&#8217;s Fitch credit rating was BB+ in 2010 when the company received&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-20026491-54.html\" type=\"external\">$1.45 billion</a>&amp;#160;from the DOE for a solar thermal plant.

Bioenergy Biomass was rated CCC when it received a $132.4 million loan in August 2010.</p> \n\n<p>Some of Richardson's largest campaign contributors received during his term as governor of New Mexico&amp;#160;lucrative regulatory exemptions and preferences that aided their companies, leading to allegations of cronyism and corruption.</p> \n\n<p>\"State regulatory changes helped transform a small company owned by a pair of Richardson administration insiders into the biggest &#8216;cradle to grave&#8217; oil field waste disposal company in the Oil Patch of southeast New Mexico,\" the Albuquerque Journal <a href=\"http://www.abqjournal.com/news/state/17235023state10-17-10.htm\" type=\"external\">reported</a> in 2010.</p> \n\n<p>Prior to his election as governor, Richardson served as secretary of the Department of Energy.</p> \n\n<p>Update Jan. 6, 4:41 p.m.:&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>\"As stated previously, Richardson had no communication or role with anyone at the bank regarding this transaction,\" an Ex-Im Bank spokesman said. \"The bank has financed several Abengoa projects over the last few years and the details of this transaction were finalized prior to Richardson joining the advisory board.\"</p> \n\n<p>Richardson is also connected to Diane Farrell, a former Ex-Im Bank director. Richardson <a href=\"http://www.westportnow.com/index.php?/v2_5/comments/5575/\" type=\"external\">headlined</a> a fundraiser for Farrell's 2004 congressional campaign that was expected to bring in $300,000.

Last year, the S&amp;amp;P 500 provided investors a 12% return, with a significant percentage of gains coming after the Nov. 8 presidential election. However, a report from investing-based social media network Openfolio found the average investor significantly underperformed the broader markets, achieving only a 5% gain.</p> \n\n<p>Here at The Motley Fool, we have a mission to help investors find stocks that will help them beat the market -- because if you can't, you're better off in index funds. With that in mind, we asked seven Motley Fool contributors for their best stock recommendation -- not just to get your portfolio in shape for the upcoming year, but for the next decade. Their picks are First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR), Concho Resources (NYSE: CXO), Under Armour (NYSE: UA) (NYSE: UAA)Mastercard (NYSE: MA)General Electric (NYSE: GE),Boston Beer Company (NYSE: SAM), and Chart Industries (NASDAQ: GTLS). They explain the rationales below:</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFUltraLong/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Sean Williams Opens a New Window.</a> (First Solar): Patient investors who have time on their side would be wise to not overlook solar panel manufacturer First Solar (NASDAQ: FSLR), though it had an abysmal 2016.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>The solar industry tends to benefit when crude oil and natural gas prices are high, because it provides a sense of urgency for utilities, businesses, and consumers to switch to solar. However, lower fossil fuel prices in recent years have reduced that urgency and hampered demand. By a similar token, Donald Trump's winning the presidency was viewed as a negative for the renewable energy industry. Trump has plans to promote domestic oil and gas production, which is naturally viewed as a knock against alternative energy.</p> \n\n<p>Despite these concerns, First Solar looks poised for a strong rebound in 2017 and beyond. To begin with, it has the strongest balance sheet of all publicly traded solar companies. It's on track to end the year with roughly $1.4 billion in net cash, which would represent about 40% of its current market value, while most of its peers are buried under mountains of debt. The greater flexibility that provides First Solar will allow it to better adapt to changing market conditions and survive downtrends.</p> \n\n<p>Though the company's recently announced restructuring -- which will cost around $600 million at the midpoint and see a quarter of its workforce laid off -- wasn't well-received by Wall Street, the actual details behind its plans make perfect sense. Its choice to abandon its Series 5 products before their rollout -- they wouldn't have made much sense given falling photovoltaic pricing -- means the company can go all-in on its more cost-efficient Series 6 products. Analysts estimate that costs to produce the Series 6 products could be about 40% lower, meaning better margins for First Solar. The Series 6 products won't deploy until 2018, meaning investors will have to be a bit patient to reap the rewards of First Solar's more efficient technology, but those investors who buy in ahead of the curve are liable to be the ones netting the best returns.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFmd19/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Matt DiLallo Opens a New Window.</a> (Concho Resources): Concho Resourcesjust might be the best-kept secret in the oil market. The oil and gas producer controls a vast land position inTexas and New Mexico's <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/16/the-5-companies-dominating-the-permian-basin.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Permian Basin Opens a New Window.</a>, which is one of the top oil plays in the world. In fact, Concho estimates that there are 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent resource potential underneath its acreage position. That resource base could fuel decades of growth for investors.</p> \n\n<p>In fact, over just the next three years, Concho Resources expects to deliver 20% compound annual production growth while living within cash flow at current oil prices. While oil prices are volatile, it is confident in its ability to hit that growth target because it has chosen to lock in a significant portion of cash flow over the next two years with commodity price hedges, which will protect it against another oil price plunge. Meanwhile, if prices rise sharply, the company has the balance sheet strength and resource position to ramp up production and capture that upside.</p> \n\n<p>Concho Resources is about to embark on a lucrative long-term expansion as it exploits the tremendous resource position it built up over the past few years. It's a ride that investors will not want to miss.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFTypeoh/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Brian Feroldi Opens a New Window.</a>(Under Armour): It is not often that investors can buy a founder-led business that holds massive long-term growth potential at a bargain price, but I think that's exactly the opportunity they have today with Under Armour.</p> \n\n<p>Shares of the fast-growing apparel and footwear company have been under pressure for months after management took a hatchet to their long-term earnings guidance. They had previously told investors that the company would produce $800 million of operating income by 2018, but dialed back on that target because they've chosen to invest more in the business. The company believes that its investments will lead to substantial growth over the long term, but they warned that it would cause their short-term margins to remain under pressure.</p> \n\n<p>Traders didn't take the news well. The company's shares have fallen by nearly a third over the last six months. That has pulled the <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/using-the-price-to-sales-ratio-to-value-stocks.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">price-to-sales ratio Opens a New Window.</a> of its class A shares below that of its key rival,Nike.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://ycharts.com/companies/UA/ps_ratio\" type=\"external\">UA PS Ratio (TTM)</a> data by <a href=\"http://ycharts.com\" type=\"external\">YCharts Opens a New Window.</a></p> \n\n<p>I can't help but feel that the relentless selling pressure is overdone. After all, Under Armour has put up 26 quarters in a row of 20%-plus revenue growth, which is an especially impressively accomplishment when you remember that its recent results were impacted by bankruptcy of The Sports Authority.Looking ahead, the company'sinvestments in footwear, <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/11/14/3-areas-of-under-armours-earnings-that-still-look.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">digital fitness Opens a New Window.</a>, and its international business should help the trend to continue.</p> \n\n<p>If you are a long-term believer in this company's management team -- <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/11/25/time-to-get-greedy-with-under-armour.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">as I am Opens a New Window.</a> -- then I think right now is a terrific time to consider joining me as a shareholder.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/Nehams/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Neha Chamaria Opens a New Window.</a>(Mastercard):As long-term investors, you want to own durable businesses with a wide economic moat, solid track record, and significant growth potential. Credit card behemoth Mastercard fits the bill. First things first: Check out the growth in Mastercard's revenue, net income, and free cash flow in the past decade. I've shown it next to rival Visa's (NYSE: V) statistics to give you a better idea.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://ycharts.com/companies/MA/free_cash_flow_ttm\" type=\"external\">MA Free Cash Flow (TTM)</a> data by <a href=\"http://ycharts.com\" type=\"external\">YCharts</a></p> \n\n<p>That steady FCF growth particularly stands out, as FCF matters the most when it comes to shareholder returns. Mastercard doesn't disappoint: It has earned returns well above40% on invested capital as well as equity since 2012, and has raised its dividend every year since. Let's not forget the $4 billion share buyback authorization that the company announced last month.</p> \n\n<p>As one of the world's leading payment-processing companies, Mastercard is staring at a massive opportunity: the ongoing shift from cash to plastic. According to Mastercard's financial arm, a staggering 85%of all transactions across the globe are still made in cash, and therein lies Mastercard's growth potential. India's recent demonetization drive, followed by an aggressive \"go digital\" campaign, is a fine example, one that the company is rightfully exploiting.</p> \n\n<p>Despite a strong run in 2016, Mastercard is cheaper than Visa at 29 times trailing earnings. That's still a bargain for long-term investors given Mastercard's growth catalysts.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFJCar/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Jamal Carnette, CFA Opens a New Window.</a>: (General Electric). General Electric has always been plagued by investor misperceptions. Under prior CEO Jack Welch, shares rallied 4,000%. However, Welch's tenure was marked by mission creep as the industrial giant ventured into real estate, media, and financial services. After the Great Recession hit in late 2007, many long-term investors were surprised to find out that General Electric was classified as a \"too big to fail\" financial institution.</p> \n\n<p>Current CEO Jeff Immelt has reoriented General Electric back to its manufacturing roots. In the short run, the company could benefit from President-elect Donald Trump's infrastructure spending plans. But even if Trump's proposals never come to fruition -- and there's considerable opposition to his plans even among his own party -- General Electric unveiled its future this month at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.</p> \n\n<p>For the past few years, General Electric has been showcasing its contributions to the consumer Internet of Things with connected appliances like refrigerators and stoves at the tech-focused trade show. A bigger opportunity for GE is in the industrial Internet of Things -- bringing connectivity and data analysis to industrial applications like electrical grids and water utilities. A 2011 white paper from the company says the Industrial Internet could benefit 46% of the global economy, a figure in excess of $32 trillion.</p> \n\n<p>General Electric will be a major player in the industrial IoT as a traditional manufacturer and as the company behind the leading operating system of the industrial internet, Predix. The tremendous opportunity of the industrial IoT is why long-term investors would be wise to add the stock to their portfolios.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFSymington/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Steve Symington Opens a New Window.</a> (Boston Beer Company): Boston Beer stock had a rough 2016, falling nearly 16% as it lost market share in each of the past four quarters. Competition is bearing down as larger brewers muscle their way into the craft category, and as smaller brewers continue to expand regional distribution. And the craft-brewing industry overall has suffered decelerating growth in recent quarters.</p> \n\n<p>However, shareholders of the leading American craft brewer have also enjoyed a modest rebound since late October, when the company's third-quarter 2016 report revealed <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/10/23/boston-beer-bubbles-up-despite-another-painful-qua.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">signs of progress Opens a New Window.</a>. Boston Beer founder and Chairman Jim Koch noted the company is finally at the \"end of a long phase of constantly increasing shelf space,\" which means retailers are opting to \"remove some of the confusion from the category\" by reducing the number of SKUs in the beer aisle. As a result, Koch says, more established names like Boston Beer should be poised to benefit.</p> \n\n<p>In the meantime -- and given its long runway for growth with less than 2% of the U.S. beer market -- Boston Beer continues to take an admirable long-term view.</p> \n\n<p>\"We remain prepared to forsake short-term earnings, as we invest to return to long-term profitable growth,\" said CEO Martin Roper, \"commensurate with the opportunities and the increased competition that we see.\"</p> \n\n<p>I don't know about you, but as a long-term investor Boston Beer is exactly the kind of company I want to see in my portfolio.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFVelvetHammer/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Jason Opens a New Window.</a> <a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFVelvetHammer/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Hall Opens a New Window.</a>(Chart Industries, Inc.): If you're looking for a successful long-term investment, Warren Buffett's advice to find a \"great business trading at a reasonable price\" is a far better strategy than a \"fair business at a great price.\" And whileChart Industries isn't trading at the fire-sale prices it was available for about a year ago, it's still relatively cheap, based on how much it has traded for in the past.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://ycharts.com/companies/GTLS/ev_ebitda\" type=\"external\">GTLS EV to EBITDA (TTM)</a> data by <a href=\"http://ycharts.com\" type=\"external\">YCharts</a></p> \n\n<p>Furthermore, it is a great business, with more than a century of success in the gas-processing equipment business (though it only recently became a standalone, publicly traded company).</p> \n\n<p>And while the company's exposure to the oil and gas industry has caused it to struggle a bit over the past couple of years -- and even led to it reporting GAAP losses in recent quarters -- its cash flows have remained steadily positive while management worked to reduce overhead and better position the business to ride out the downturn in the oil and gas industry.</p> \n\n<p>But while the cyclical energy downturn has been painful, Chart is positioned to emerge from it even stronger. The company launched a service-and-support operation over the past year that has already started generating steady, recurring cash flow. This should reduce cyclical impacts in the future, while also providing a new source of long-term profits. And while the company did shutter some facilities and lay off employees, management prioritized retaining key engineering and customer-support personnel, making sure Chart was well-positioned to handle the expected influx of new orders when the energy cycle returns to growth.</p> \n\n<p>Bottom line: Don't let the irrational exuberance of a few years ago mask the quality nature of Chart's business.

The Evansville labor dispute is the second in three months to feature sympathy strikes against Republic Services. This rare tactic represents a major escalation in the Teamsters' struggle with the company, and it's poised to intensify this week.</p> \n\n<p>As I <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">reported</a> for Working In These Times, Republic Services/ Allied Waste, the second-largest solid waste company in the United States, locked 79 workers out of their jobs six weeks ago. (Under U.S. labor law, when union contracts expire, companies can lock workers out, and either shut down production or bring in replacement workers to do their jobs.) Republic told workers they&#8217;d be locked out unless they accepted a &#8220;last, best and final&#8220; offer that would eliminate their pensions and replace them with 401(k)s.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Teamsters Local 215 refused the offer, and Republic followed through on the threat. While Republic is only locking workers out in Evansville, the union says the company is proposing to get out of the pension fund in several cities where contracts have expired.</p> \n\n<p>On May 24, locked-out Republic workers traveled to Urbana, Illinois, and started picketing a local Republic facility. In solidarity, members of Teamsters Local 26 refused to work. On May 30, Republic workers in Wayne, Michigan did the same, as did their counterparts in Richmond, California on June 1. Three days later, members of three Teamsters locals in Milpitas, California &#8211; some employed by Republic, some hired by other companies to make deliveries to Republic &#8211; followed suit. So did members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Ironworkers union hired to build a recycling facility there. On June 8, another 300 Teamsters in Long Beach, California did their own one-day sympathy strike.</p> \n\n<p>A Teamsters source who requested anonymity said he expected the conflict to expand further this week, including \"escalations with workers who have expired contracts and a strong possibility of those pickets being extended to other locations.\"</p> \n\n<p>Maurice Thomas, a Republic diesel mechanic and Teamsters shop steward, says 90% of his co-workers in Long Beach participated in the one-day work stoppage. Despite favorable contract language, Thomas says it wasn&#8217;t easy: Management &#8220;did everything they could to prevent us from doing it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>According to Thomas, Republic posted a notice saying that anyone who missed work on Friday would be required to work on Saturday &#8211; normally a day off - instead. When workers struck on Friday and didn&#8217;t come to work on Saturday, Republic said they would be disciplined. But Thomas saus that the number of workers involved, the contract language, and the pushback from rank-and-file leaders on the property forced management to back down.</p> \n\n<p>Thomas says he welcomed the chance to support co-workers in Evansville because &#8220;ultimately, the management is going to back each other up from city to city. We have to be one union, one contrat. If we stick to that, we can have just as much power as corporate America.&#8221; Thomas was also glad to send a message to local management, whom he accused of forcing drivers to work unsafe levels of overtime.</p> \n\n<p>Chuck Whobrey, the president of Local 215, says that for the 79 workers in Evansville, facing &#8220;the monster of a company, it can be a pretty lonely feeling. And so whenever they&#8217;ve extended the picket lines, it has really had a huge impact&#8221; on workers to see support from &#8220;people they don&#8217;t even know. Anytime you can get through to people that they&#8217;re in something bigger than themselves, it really does inspire them.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>As for management, Whobrey says, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say they&#8217;re more dug in, but I think that they&#8217;re following whatever plan of action they had from Day 1 of negotiations.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The Teamsters have also reached out to Republic&#8217;s shareholders, contrasting the cost of pension payments with a promised death benefit for Republic&#8217;s CEO, which they say is worth $23 million. Last month the union protested outside a shareholder meeting and introduced a shareholder resolution that would have given shareholders a vote on death benefits; it failed with 41% of the vote.</p> \n\n<p>Republic did not respond to a request for comment, but in interviews last month, local general manager Mark McKune described the lockout as a&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.14news.com/story/18168968/allied-waste-services\" type=\"external\">response</a>&amp;#160;to &#8220;threats of war&#8221; from the union, and the proposal to replace pensions as&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.courierpress.com/news/2012/may/07/allied-waste-says-lockout-planned-tuesday/\" type=\"external\">motivated</a>&amp;#160;by concerns over the pension fund&#8217;s solvency.</p> \n\n<p>The Sympathy Strike Strategy</p> \n\n<p>Before the National Labor Relations Act established legal collective bargaining rights within discrete bargaining units, and the Taft-Hartley Amendments banned many solidarity actions, strikes would commonly spread from one group of workers to other worksites in the industry, or to other workers in the supply chain. Today, such solidarity strikes are rare.</p> \n\n<p>The Teamsters&#8217; ability to pull them off rests in part on a &#8220;conscience clause&#8221; in some of their contracts, which specifies that workers can&#8217;t be required to work if it means crossing a picket line. (Other workers who had expired contracts have participated in solidarity strikes this year, and thus weren&#8217;t prohibited from striking.) Wherever other Teamsters &#8211; even a single one &#8211; set up a picket line, workers with a conscience clause have the right the forfeit pay and refuse work.</p> \n\n<p>In March, union officials in Mobile, Alabama, credited such solidarity strikes with a big role in the contract they won at Republic. As I&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/story/154765/rare_rolling_sympathy_strike_beats_garbage_company_that_tries_to_trash_its_promise/\" type=\"external\">reported</a>&amp;#160;for Alternet, workers in Mobile struck for eight days after alleging that Republic was attempting to back out of already agreed-upon provisions in tentative contract agreements. During that strike, workers in three other cities refused work for days at a time.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s awesome,&#8221; Mobile striker Michael McLean said during the strike. &#8220;It shows that the brotherhood is strong, wherever you&#8217;re at.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Reviving the Strike&amp;#160;author and In These Times contributor Joe Burns observed at the time that &#8220;The Teamsters are relatively rare within the labor movement&#8221; because their contracts protect &#8220;the ability to honor picket lines.&#8221; Burns, a negotiator for the Association of Flight Attendants, said that while there are &#8220;plenty of examples within the Teamsters of conservative trade union officials choosing not to honor picket lines,&#8221; overall the Teamsters &#8220;still have that culture of solidarity within their union that&#8217;s been lost by a lot of unions&#8221; barred from such actions.</p> \n\n<p>But there are limits to the tactic. While Mobile workers told me during their strike that they&#8217;d welcome the chance to show reciprocal solidarity, their contract has no conscience clause, and so they&#8217;d be bound by the &#8220;No strike&#8221; clause of their current contract even if Evansville workers showed up to picket.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve brought it up,&#8221; in negotiations, says Levon &#8220;Rooster&#8221; Lindsey, a business representative for Mobile-based Teamsters Local 991. \"The company&#8217;s never even offered to accept that language. But it&#8217;s something, looking forward, that we&#8217;re looking to get.&#8221; Lindsey was interviewed while in Evansville, where he was meeting with locked-out workers to share stories from the Mobile victory.</p> \n\n<p>Barred from striking, workers in Mobile and elsewhere have taken less disruptive acts of solidarity, including wearing stickers that say &#8220;Stop Trashing Our Contract.&#8221; Lindsey says Mobile workers may do informational pickets at the Mobile facility, in which union members show up early before their shift and demonstrate outside the plant during non-work time.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The core of the Teamsters is a pension plan,&#8221; says Lindsey.&amp;#160; &#8220;We must fight and we must win.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Whobrey says that representatives from several Teamsters locals that deal with Republic met on Wednesday to discuss further steps to press the company to end the lockout. Thomas says he&#8217;s talked to workers in Gardenia, California, who are &#8220;waiting their turn&#8221; to mount a work stoppage as well. Meanwhile, Thomas says, co-workers have told him they were energized by the one-day strike: &#8220;They said that we should do it once a month.&#8221;</p>", "title": "Teamsters Punish Lockout With Rolling Sympathy Strikes", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://inthesetimes.com/working/entry/13387/republic_teamsters_evansville_sympathy_strike_lockout_allied_waste/", "published_at": "2012-06-18", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>In Cameroon, many mothers <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5107360.stm\" type=\"external\">pound and \"iron\" flat</a> the breasts of their daughters with heated bananas or coconut shells, hoping to discourage the sexual advances of males who see developed breasts as indicators of sexual maturity.</p> \n\n<p>BBC:</p> \n\n<p>A nationwide campaign is under way in Cameroon to discourage the widespread practice of \"breast ironing\".</p> \n\n<p>This involves pounding and massaging the developing breasts of young girls with hot objects to try to make them disappear.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Statistics show that 26% of Cameroonian girls at puberty undergo it, as many mothers believe it protects their daughters from the sexual advances of boys and men who think children are ripe for sex once their breasts begin to grow.</p> \n\n<p>The most widely used instrument to flatten the breasts is a wooden pestle, used for pounding tubers in the kitchen.

He reminded the audience that he <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-06-28-immigration-roll-call_N.htm\" type=\"external\">voted for President George W. Bush&#8217;s immigration reform bill as a senator</a>, and that the bill had been scuttled by immigration restrictionists from Bush&#8217;s own party.</p> \n\n<p>The president&#8217;s reception at NALEO was very warm&#8212;he drew several standing ovations. His defense of his&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">decision to exempt DREAM Act-eligible unauthorized immigrants from deportation</a>&amp;#160;was well-received. &#8220;They are Americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every single way but on paper&#8212;and all they want is to go to college and give back to the country they love,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;Lifting the shadow of deportation and giving them a reason to hope was the right thing to do.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Obama didn&#8217;t mention Romney&amp;#160;by name, but he did refer to his rival&#8217;s pledge to veto the DREAM Act.&amp;#160;&#8220;Your speaker from yesterday has a different view,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;In his speech, he said that when he makes a promise to you, he&#8217;ll keep it. Well, he has promised to veto the DREAM Act, and we should take him at his word.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The president also directly blamed Republican partisanship for the collapse of immigration reform efforts. Here&#8217;s the key section of his speech:</p> \n\n<p>In the face of a Congress that refuses to do anything on immigration, I&#8217;ve said that I&#8217;ll take action wherever I can. My Administration has been doing what we can without help in Congress for more than three years. And last week, we took another step. On Friday, we announced that we&#8217;re lifting the shadow of deportation from deserving young people who were brought to this country as children. We should have passed the DREAM Act a long time ago. It was written by members of both parties. But when it came up for a vote two years ago, Republicans in Congress got together and blocked it. The bill hadn&#8217;t really changed. The need definitely hadn&#8217;t changed. The only thing that had changed, apparently, was politics.</p> \n\n<p>This is not an entirely accurate portrayal of events. Republicans did band together to block the DREAM Act, including several former co-sponsors of previous versions of the bill. But they were joined by skittish centrist Democrats. The final vote was 55 to 41, with five Senate Democrats joining the opposition. Had Obama delivered the votes of his own party, the DREAM Act would have passed. And if Republicans who previously supported the legislation hadn&#8217;t decided it was terrible after Obama supported it, it would have passed.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>The president has a big advantage over Romney with Latinos, but his task is arguably harder. With little progress on reform but a verbal commitment to policies Latino voters prefer, Obama has to seriously energize Latino voters to have a chance at retaining the Oval Office. Romney, on the other hand, doesn&#8217;t have to win a majority of the Latino vote&#8212;he just has to convince enough of them he wouldn&#8217;t be that bad.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Obama Immigration Speech: Latinos Should Blame Republicans for Blocking Immigration Reform", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/obama-immigration-speech-naleo/", "published_at": "2012-06-22", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>$5,000 might not seem like enough to invest in the stock market. However, $5,000 put in the right stock could blossom to more than $1 million over a few decades. Let's take a closer look at three of the most well-known examples from the tech industry -- Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO).</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Getty Images.</p> \n\n<p>Apple went public in 1980 at$22 per share. $5,000 would have been enough to buy 227 shares. After four splits, you would now own 12,712 shares, which would be worth roughly $1.3 million. Moreover, that position would be paying out nearly $29,000 in dividends per year.</p> \n\n<p>Apple's early years, which mainly relied on Apple II and Mac sales, were rocky. Co-founder Steve Jobs left his own company after a dispute with the board in 1985, and its products were subsequently crushed by Microsoft's rapidly growing market share across IBMPC clones.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Apple's growth didn't get back on track until an older and wiser Jobs returned to Apple in 1997. With a renewed focus on sleek hardware and end-to-end control of its ecosystem, Jobs' Apple launched the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad -- all hit products which redefined their respective industries. Between 1997 and 2011 -- the year Jobs resigned and passed away -- Apple's annual revenue rose from$7.1 billion to$108.2 billion. That figure hit $215.6 billion infiscal 2016.</p> \n\n<p>Microsoft went public for$21 per share in 1986. $5,000 would be enough to buy 238 shares. After nine splits, you would own 34,272 shares, which would be worth $1.99 million. You would also be earning over $53,000 in dividends per year.</p> \n\n<p>Microsoft's core business was built on providing an easy-to-use OS for IBM-compatible PC clones throughout the 1980s and 1990s. That product, Windows, quickly became a unifying OS for the fragmented hardware market, and gave Microsoft a firm foundation to launch additional products like Office and Internet Explorer. Between 1997 and 2007, the year the first iPhone was introduced, Microsoft's annual revenue rose from$8.7 billion to$51.1 billion.</p> \n\n<p>However, Microsoft missed the crucial technological shift toward mobile devices, where it fell woefully behind Apple and Google. The fragmentation of the Windows and Office markets, caused by users who didn't upgrade their \"good enough\" software, then throttled the tech giant's top line growth. Today's Microsoft is still struggling to grow its top line, but its aggressive shift toward mobile-first, cloud-first solutions with the universal Windows Store, Azure, Cortana, and Bing are gradually getting the company back on track.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Microsoft.</p> \n\n<p>Cisco went public for $18 per share in1990. You could have bought 277 shares, which would have been split9 times into 79,776 shares. That position would be worth nearly $2.5 million today, and be paying out $83,000 in annual dividends.</p> \n\n<p>Cisco was a darling of the dot-com boom, surging to a split-adjusted $79 per share in March 2000. Investors, seemingly enamored with the notion that the networking company's routers and switches would link up everything in the world, bid the stock's P/E ratio up to over 200 by the end of 2000.</p> \n\n<p>That ratio proved unsustainable for Cisco, which only grew its net income by35% in 2000, and the stock plunged to about $12 the following year. Since then, Cisco has evolved into a mature tech stock which is owned for income instead of explosive growth. With its core markets routers and switch markets being heavily commoditized, Cisco has pivoted toward higher-growth markets like cybersecurity, service provider video, and collaboration solutions in recent years.</p> \n\n<p>Past performance never guarantees future returns, but the growth stories of Apple, Microsoft, and Cisco show just how much patience pays off. If you had sold these stocks after they doubled or tripled, you would have missed out on the massive gains that came decades later. Therefore, never underestimate the potential of a seemingly small $5,000 investment to eventually make you a millionaire.</p> \n\n<p>A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

I'm Paul Jay in Washington. When the debate broke out in 2008 and 2009 about the financial crisis, one of the critical issues was the role of derivatives, the role of commodities trading, and especially the role of what was called excessive speculation. And there's been a lot of debate about just how much does speculation drive up things like food prices, energy prices. Now joining us to talk about that and what public policy might be in people's interest about commodities and such is Michael Greenberger. Michael teaches at the school of law at the University of Maryland. He was previously, between 1997 and '99, director of Division of Trading and Markets at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and he worked for Brooksley Born. He is also a technical advisor for many groups and congressmen. Thanks very much for joining us. \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />PROF. MICHAEL GREENBERGER, FMR. DIRECTOR, TRADING AND MARKETS DIV., CFTC: Pleasure to be here. \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />JAY: So let's just start with that basic question: to what extent does speculation or excessive speculation affect the price of energy and food? \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />GREENBERGER: Well, as we sit here today, there's little doubt that excessive speculation, that is, speculation that's unnecessary to the structure of the hedging markets for food and energy, is causing a inflationary bubble. And the American consumer, and, for that matter, consumers worldwide, are paying an unnecessary premium for food and energy, which goes into the pockets of big banks and Wall Street traders and has nothing to do with developing supplies of scarce commodities. \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />JAY: Well, before we explore more of what excessive speculation is, what do you consider not excessive speculation? \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />GREENBERGER: Well, you have to understand this in a historical context, and it really goes back to the beginning of the 20th century. In the beginning of the 20th century, the only derivative product or futures product that was extant were futures contracts that allowed farmers and consumers of farm products to hedge their pricing exposure. In other words, when a farmer began to plant a seed, he wanted to be guaranteed a certain price when the crops were brought out of the ground. So you could buy what were insurance contracts that gave you a hedge and an insurance for a fair price for the growth of your product. Similarly, those who used those products--for example, bakers and millers--similarly went into those markets to make sure they weren't paying too high a price. And the tension between the consumer and the producer caused the futures markets to be a fair reflection of what supply-demand would designate prices to be. In the beginning of the 20th century, farmers figured out that in the trading venue which was in Chicago at the various futures exchanges, the traders could manipulate the price up and down by overwhelming the market with speculative bets on price direction. And what the farmers determined, and for that matter the bakers and the millers determined, was they couldn't use these markets as insurance contracts, because the speculators were driving the prices in such a fashion that the markets became unusable. \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />JAY: Give an example of how that would work. I mean, how does a speculator do that? \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />GREENBERGER: Well, a farmer, when they're hedging, is thinking about a fair price to get at the end of the farm season. He needs to interact with the consumer of farm products, who wants a fair price as well. The farmer wants the highest price; the consumer wants the lowest price. And the tension between those traders who are forming these contracts makes the price adhere to supply-demand fundamentals. If speculators get involved, they don't care what a fair price is. If they conspire or work together or flood the market, they can say, okay, let's drive the price way up by bidding the price up irrelevant to any economic needs. In those days also--it's not true today, and I can explain why, but in those days also, they would bid the price down and try and short the market. But they were destroying these markets [that are] for the use of hedging to protect the farmer and the consumer of farm products directly, and the consumer indirectly, who benefited from the tension of this price-development mechanism. In the first piece of legislation Franklin Delano Roosevelt sent to the New Deal Congress was a response to this problem, an answer to the farmers' concerns about speculation. And he and the New Deal Congress, in passing the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936, had a simple resolution to this matter, and that was, market by market, limiting the involvement of speculators. To some extent there is good speculation, in that it allows the farmer and the consumer in this market to have liquidity and get in and out of contracts, and the speculator creates that liquidity. But there's a tipping point when there is excessive speculation. Liquidity concerns go out the door, and prices become unmoored from price-demand fundamentals. What Roosevelt and the New Deal Congress said: we're going to put limits on speculation in those markets. And from 1936 to the early '90s, those markets functioned very smoothly. There were price variables, but the price variables dealt with supply-demand. For example, if there was a short supply of wheat, the price would go up. \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />JAY: By limits you mean how much any one party could own or control. Is it similar to what's being called position limits now? \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />GREENBERGER: Yes. And it's not a party. It's a person who is in the market who has no need to hedge physical supplies that they are growing or buying. It is people who just want to bet, who don't touch the underlying commodity but want to bet on price direction. And historically, from 1936 to 1990, a smoothly functioning market, whether you're talking about wheat or you're talking about crude oil or you're talking about metals, was 70 percent commercial handlers trying to hedge their prices and adhering the price to supply-demand fundamentals, and 30 percent speculators, who are in the market betting on price direction, but are actually helping the market by assisting the producers in creating liquidity in the market. \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />JAY: So this, for example, is an airlines that hedges their cost of fuel for the year, versus that someone's just making a bet. \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />GREENBERGER: Exactly. Someone wants to bet on the direction--now, fuel--jet fuel is not a commodity, and what the airlines use is crude oil as a derivative. So they've hedged in the crude oil markets. But a speculator would go into the market, say, I don't even know what a barrel of oil looks like, but I want to bet it's going to go up or I want to bet it's going to go down. What happened in the 1990s is, almost under the radar screen, the big Wall Street banks, beginning with Goldman Sachs, created stealth exemptions to these limitations, to allow them to get more heavily involved in the market as speculators, but going under the radar screen. And essentially the principal vehicle these big banks used--and today the two foremost banks are Goldman and Morgan Stanley--is they wanted to offer their customers the ability to bet on the price direction of food and energy. So they would take in--and they do today--take in bets from customers. Just like you go to a horse race and you go to the betting parlor and you say, I want to bet on a certain horse, they invite wealthy investors to come in and bet on the direction of a basket of 25 food and energy commodities. The bettor does--just like you don't own a horse when you go to the horse race, the bettor wouldn't even know what kind of wheat they're betting on, but they're placing money down. You have to be wealthy to do this with Goldman, with Morgan Stanley, to bet, and they can only bet that the direction will go up, the price will go up. Goldman and Morgan Stanley now have to go into the futures market, where there are people who are legitimately hedging their commercial bets. They, from 1990 to the summer of 2008, not even going to the CFTC commission but to the staff, got secret exemptions that allowed them to lay off their risk from their betting parlor by placing offsetting bets in the futures market. Now, if you just follow the thread, Goldman and Morgan Stanley are taking bets from their customers the price will go up; therefore, they will lose if the price goes down. They, like a bookie, don't want to be in that position, 'cause they're--through their analysts, are pumping up the price anyway. So they go into the real futures market, where there are consequences to the transaction, and they bet there that the price will go up, to offset the bet with their customers. They got exemptions from the Franklin Delano Roosevelt position limits. That allowed them to do it. And their theory was, hey, we're hedging just like the airlines are hedging, 'cause we're in the betting business and we're hedging our bets. In the summer of 2008, when oil went to a world record high of $147 a barrel, Democrats in the House of Representatives unearthed all these exemptions and were able to discover that markets that were thought to be 70 percent commercial and 30 percent speculative were then 70 percent speculative and 30 percent commercial. Dodd-Frank has a provision in it that says, essentially, we must go back to the old Roosevelt idea and protect these hedging markets from excessive speculation. That is to say, roughly speaking, 30 percent speculation is okay. We now have in these markets 80 percent speculators, most of whom wouldn't know what a barrel of oil looked like, and only 20 percent commercials who were trying to hedge their bets. As a result of that, and because the betting instruments only allowed you to bet that the direction of the price will go up, we are seeing these bubbles. In 2008, for example, oil went to $147. During the recession, investors pulled their money out. It went back down. In July 2008, it was $147. By December-January, it was down to $33. As the economy started to improve and speculators drove back in, it raced back up to $75 a barrel by the summer of 2009. At that point, the chairman of the CFTC said, hey, we've got to do something about this. That led to legislation where Congress passed a provision that said you've got to keep speculators out of these markets, they are sending false signals, inflating the market unnecessarily, and these markets have no relationship to supply-demand. Unfortunately, in January 2011, the CFTC issued a proposal--which it's not even clear that a majority of commissioners would support in the final text--that basically did not implement what Congress intended, and essentially preserved the status quo ante. What does that mean? We've got oil markets, wheat markets, copper markets, rice, with 80 percent speculation, 20 percent commercial, and the markets are veering willy-nilly. The demonstration is in the most recent meltdown that we've seen in the stock market: the oil market completely followed the Dow Jones going down when there was worry over the S&amp;amp;P downgrade. And now that the stock market's getting footing, crude oil is going back up again. So it is not a supply-demand factor that is governing the price of these products; it is how much money speculators have to put in those markets. And there are dozens of world hunger groups who are at the table right now, saying that in Third World countries people are starving because Wall Street speculators have this little betting parlor going on and are artificially inflating the price of these commodities. \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />JAY: Now, we were told that the CFTC is planning to regulate position limits and come up with a number like 10 percent, and they're trying to work at the regulation, but that lobbyists are slowing them down, but that there is some intent to do that. Is that the case? \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />GREENBERGER: Well, most progressives groups--and, by the way, Dodd-Frank has caused the CFTC, over a broad range of financial regulation, to deal with 50 different rules that they have to create. Ninety percent of them are very controversial. If they're properly implemented, they undercut the too-big-to-fail banks, who are fighting like crazy to preserve their oligopoly over all markets. This rule on position limits, going back to the Roosevelt idea that speculators should be driven from these markets, is the most controversial. All the rules have had 20,000 comments. Twelve thousand of those comments have been focused on position limits. The big banks, the big hedge funds, the big private equity firms want to have phony regulation here to make it appear that something's being done, but actually preserving the status quo ante. The progressive groups that have testified on this--unions, consumer groups, the ARP, environmental groups, public interest groups--are saying that the proposal is a phony, it doesn't do anything, it's regulation in name only, and want to put out of business the gambling that is going on in these markets. And the damning thing about this is, once you understand this, it is not that hard to--difficult--it is not that difficult to understand how the American consumer is being taken to the cleaners. But so far there's been no effort by any policymaker, whether it's in the executive branch or the legislative branch, to clearly explain to the American people that Wall Street is putting money in its pockets that has nothing to do with developing oil, developing natural gas, developing--producing metals, producing farm products. It's going--it's a betting parlor, and the money is going directly into the pocket of wealthy people. And when the American public is paying $4 a gallon for gasoline, none of that payment really has very much to do with developing new sources of energy and everything to do with putting pockets--money in the pockets of Wall Street. \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />JAY: So if you were writing the regulation on position limits, what would it say? \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />GREENBERGER: What I would say is anybody who is involved in a betting parlor and, like a bookie, laying off their risk is got to be subject to the very toughest position limits. Right now, the rule, it does exactly what Wall Street wanted. Wall Street said, we're bettors, and we're laying off our risk like a bookie; so therefore we're commercial interests, and we should buy up all the contracts we want. And the proposed rule says, yes, that's right, you guys have at it, and then for everybody else we'll have limits. You've got to knock the bettors, the betting parlors, which are banks, out of this market, make them subject to position limits. If that happens, most economists who've examined this--and many have--will say the price of these commodities will drop substantially. \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />JAY: Thanks very much for joining us. \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />GREENBERGER: Pleasure to be here. \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />JAY: Thank you for joining us on The Real News Network. \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />End of Transcript \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />DISCLAIMER: Please note that transcripts for The Real News Network are typed from a recording of the program.

But <a href=\"http://www.childrenshospital.org/researchers/martha-murray\" type=\"external\">Dr. Martha Murray Opens a New Window.</a> of Boston Children&#8217;s Hospital has spent most of the last two decades developing Bridge-Enhanced ACL Repair, or BEAR &#8211; an experimental, minimally invasive procedure that early evidence suggests can reduce recovery time and lessen the long-term risk of developing painful arthritis in the knee.</p> \n\n<p>Traditionally, orthopedic surgeons use a tendon graft to reconnect a damaged ACL &#8211; an invasive method that also weakens the muscle group from which the tendon was taken. The BEAR surgery, developed in conjunction with Harvard Medical School and the NFL players union-funded Football Players Health Study, uses stitches to repair the ACL and a surgical sponge to bridge the gap in the torn ligament, which can then use the body&#8217;s healing processes to naturally regenerate.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The ACL has a really productive response to injury, in that it does all the right things biologically,&#8221; Dr. Murray told FOXBusiness.com. &#8220;It makes new cells, it really tries to heal itself, but it can never bridge the gap between the two torn ends of the ligament.</p> \n\n<p>ACL injuries aren&#8217;t just a problem for pro athletes. They&#8217;re also prevalent throughout the general American population, especially for the physically active. Estimates vary, but anywhere from 250,000 to 400,000 people suffer ACL injuries annually, at a healthcare cost in excess of $2 billion. The cost of an individual procedure fluctuates wildly based on surgeon, facility and whether the patient has insurance.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Murray&#8217;s quest to develop a new kind of treatment began when she, as a graduate student in an engineering program, spoke to a friend who had recently torn his ACL. She was stunned to learn that ACL tears required a tendon graft and six months of grueling rehab, with no guarantee of a return to full strength.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I was like, that&#8217;s crazy. Why can&#8217;t the thing just heal? Everything else in our body tends to heal. Why does the ACL, even if you sew it back together, why doesn&#8217;t it heal? I just got very interested in the issue,&#8221; Murray said.</p> \n\n<p>She enrolled in medical school and began to study the ACL&#8217;s healing processes. In 2000, she discovered that the problem lay in the fact that fluid in the knee joint dissolved blood from the ligament&#8217;s torn ends before they could form a clot and naturally bind together.</p> \n\n<p>Murray spent the next 16 years developing a protein &#8220;sponge&#8221; that holds the patient&#8217;s blood in place, allowing the ligament to heal. Early tests on animal models revealed BEAR subjects had a much lower incidence of knee arthritis compared to those who underwent traditional surgery.</p> \n\n<p>In 2014, the NFLPA, which had been tracking Murray&#8217;s progress since the early animal trials, agreed to fund her work as part of a research partnership with Harvard Medical School. Known as the &#8220; <a href=\"https://footballplayershealth.harvard.edu/\" type=\"external\">Football Players Health Study Opens a New Window.</a>,&#8221; the Harvard researchers are tasked with finding solutions for common injuries and health issues among NFL players, such as concussions and chronic joint pain.</p> \n\n<p>Murray&#8217;s work with BEAR is considered one of three &#8220;high reward&#8221; pilot studies, according to Sean Sansiveri, the NFLPA&#8217;s vice president of business and legal affairs. Sansiveri declined to say how much grant money was being funneled toward Murray&#8217;s work, but acknowledged that union officials are &#8220;beyond encouraged&#8221; by its early results.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the application is limited to the NFL,&#8221; Sansiveri told FOXBusiness.com. &#8220;I think it has a much broader application amongst other athletes and everyday civilians and the military and beyond. A lot of that would be Martha&#8217;s plans and Martha&#8217;s decisions, but we would certainly support her in that effort.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Murray and her team are actively tracking the results of BEAR&#8217;s first human trial, which consisted of 10 patients who underwent the new procedure and 10 who underwent traditional ACL reconstruction surgery. As of this week, all trial patients are at least six months removed from surgery, while about half are a year removed.</p> \n\n<p>So far, BEAR patients are back to full strength after about six months, compared to nine to 12 months for a traditional procedure. It&#8217;s too soon to say if human patients will show the same reduced incident of knee arthritis as the animal models, but researchers are optimistic.</p> \n\n<p>Based on data gathered at the three- and six-month stages of the first BEAR trial, Murray has already received permission from the Federal Drug Administration to pursue a second, larger study of 100 patients. The trial began on May 1.</p> \n\n<p>Even if all goes well with the new trial, it will likely be several years before BEAR can become a mass-market solution to knee ligament injuries. The FDA will need to see months of positive data from the second trial before it can grant permission for widespread use in hospitals.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just for the NFL, but in all sports, women&#8217;s soccer players, all the people that are getting these tears,&#8221; Murray said. &#8220;They&#8217;re just devastating on every level. If we can make the treatment and the recovery a little bit easier for people, we&#8217;d really like to do that.&#8221;</p>", "title": "New ACL Procedure A Game Changer For NFL?", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2016/06/14/new-acl-procedure-game-changer-for-nfl.html", "published_at": "2016-06-15", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>The&amp;#160;crisis is developing exactly as expected.

This is a secondary matter, to be sure. The primary concern should be that amnesty is on the table at all, and I will have more to say about this soon, including a few words at the end of this post.</p> \n\n<p>Turning back to the composition of the Gang, though, I should mention Sen. Marco Rubio&#8217;s involvement. He is, after all, the key member &#8212; as a conservative Hispanic he provides the political &#8220;cover&#8221; that John McCain and Lindsey Graham cannot.</p> \n\n<p>Rubio has already confessed his lack of expertise on the issue at hand. Yesterday, he said &#8220;I am clearly new to this issue in terms of the Senate.&#8221; But, he added:</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;m not in terms of my life. I live surrounded by immigrants. My neighbors are immigrants. My family is immigrants. Married into a family of immigrants. I see immigration everyday. I see the good of immigration.</p> \n\n<p>Welcome to policy analysis in the Age of Oprah.</p> \n\n<p>In his self-promo, Rubio scrupulously avoided the phrase &#8220;illegal immigration.&#8221; But that is the aspect of the immigration issue that amnesty pertains to.</p> \n\n<p>Rubio also showed himself to be the perfect Gang companion for John McCain. The Arizona Senator has built a career around confusing his personal life experiences with policy expertise. McCain was tortured, so he knows that torture doesn&#8217;t work. Never mind that the methods and intelligence expertise of the North Vietnamese in the late 1960s bear virtually no resemblance to those employed by the U.S. almost 40 years later. And never mind that, according to McCain&#8217;s acceptance speech at the 2008 Republican convention, the North Vietnamese did, in fact, &#8220;break&#8221; him.</p> \n\n<p>McCain was caught up in the Keating Five scandal in the 1990s, so he knows that money can corrupt even the most honest and heroic politicians. Therefore, he reckoned he was just the man to work across the aisle to &#8220;fix&#8221; our campaign finance system through the atrocity that became McCain-Feingold.</p> \n\n<p>Now along comes Marco Rubio. He&#8217;s surrounded by immigration and sees that it is good. Somehow, this general insight is supposed to give him the judgment and expertise to write complex legislation dealing with illegal immigration, a phenomenon he is either incapable of distinguishing, as a moral matter, from the legal variety or is unwilling to denounce.</p> \n\n<p>Instead, Rubio instructs us that &#8220;we have to deal with the people who are here now in a way that&#8217;s responsible but humane.&#8221; But he doesn&#8217;t explain how granting an eventual path to citizenship for illegal aliens meets this test. The people who are here illegally now already receive at least as many benefits as they deserve, having violated our laws. They have access to employment opportunities and to a vast array of services that they would not enjoy had they followed the law and not entered the U.S. &#8212; opportunities and services that are not enjoyed by those attempting to get into this country legally.</p> \n\n<p>If the absence of a path to citizenship makes this deal insufficiently &#8220;humane&#8221; for illegal immigrants, then the &#8220;responsible&#8221; solution is for them to return to their country of origin, not for the U.S. to sweeten the deal. Perhaps Rubio&#8217;s immersion in the world of immigrants prevents him from understanding this.</p> \n\n<p>Naturally, there is much speculation about whether Rubio&#8217;s collusion with the Senate&#8217;s most liberal members, and with professional mavericks McCain and Graham, to bring about amnesty will affect his prospects for winning the Republican nomination. It certainly should.</p>", "title": "Marco Rubio and policy analysis in the Age of Oprah", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/01/marco-rubio-and-policy-analysis-in-the-age-of-oprah.php", "published_at": "2013-01-29", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>&amp;lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/worldeconomicforum/3191028700/\"&amp;gt;World Economic Forum&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;/Flickr</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>On Wednesday, the nonprofit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) <a href=\"http://www.citizensforethics.org/video/news-corp.-should-be-investigated-by-congress-re-phone-hacking-scandal\" type=\"external\">upped the ante</a> in the ongoing furor over Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News Corp. and the widening British phone-hacking scandal. Democratic members of Congress, including West Virginia <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/07/13/senator-news-corp-probe-hacking-bribery_n_896888.html\" type=\"external\">Sen. Jay Rockefeller</a>, have called on various federal agencies to investigate allegations that reporters working for News Corp.&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/\" type=\"external\">News of the World</a> may have hacked the voicemail of 9/11 victims and also attempted to bribe a New York City police officer for their phone records. But CREW has suggested that Congress itself should take up the cause and launch hearings on the brewing scandal. CREW&#8217;s executive director Melanie Sloan said in a <a href=\"http://www.citizensforethics.org/press/entry/crew-congress-should-hold-news-corp-hearings-immediately\" type=\"external\">statement</a>:</p> \n\n<p>While it is encouraging that Sen. Rockefeller shares CREW&#8217;s concern about whether American 9/11 victims had their voicemails hacked, there is no need to cede all investigative authority to the executive branch. Just as the British Parliament has held hearings and heard the testimony of witnesses, Congress has the ability to subpoena News Corp. employees and require them to explain themselves. The idea that News Corp. may have sought to exploit the victims of one of the darkest days in US history for financial gain is grotesque. Even in these hyper-partisan days, Congress should be able to put the privacy of terrorist victims and their families above politics. Mr. Murdoch and his acolytes must be held accountable here as well as in Great Britain.</p> \n\n<p>So far, though, Republicans who control the House don&#8217;t seem to be in a big hurry to answer the call. <a href=\"http://issa.house.gov/\" type=\"external\">Rep. Darrell Issa</a> (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which has wide-ranging investigative jurisdiction, did not respond to a request for comment. And even the Senate Democrats haven&#8217;t yet responded to CREW&#8217;s request. But it&#8217;s still early, and they may be waiting to see if the Justice Department will act.</p> \n\n<p>Everyone from former New York Attorney General <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2299038/\" type=\"external\">Eliot Spitzer</a> to <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/media/2011/07/13/267745/breaking-sen-frank-lautenberg-calls-for-doj-sec-to-investigate-news-corp/\" type=\"external\">Sen. Frank Lautenberg</a> (D-N.J.) has suggested that News Corp. could possibly be prosecuted for violating the <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/\" type=\"external\">Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</a>, which bans American companies from engaging in bribery abroad. News Corp. is incorporated in Delaware and is listed on the NASDAQ, meaning that the US would have jurisdiction to investigate the bribery and hacking charges raised in Great Britain. The Justice Department has increasingly used the FCPA in recent years, stepping up investigations and prosecutions of companies from <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/21/business/worldbusiness/21siemens.html\" type=\"external\">Siemens</a> to <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/corruption-currents/2011/03/25/malaysia-telcos-ban-alcatel-lucent-from-contract-bidding/\" type=\"external\">Alcatel-Lucent</a> to <a href=\"http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-87.htm\" type=\"external\">Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson</a>. So News Corp. could be fair game, at least from a legal standpoint.</p> \n\n<p>But it&#8217;s a dicey move for the Justice Department to go after a news-gathering organization. Aside from the various free-speech issues involved, prosecuting News Corp., the owner of Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, would be politically perilous for the Obama administration. It may be that the facts in this case are outrageous enough that even the most partisan tea partier could forgive the administration for going after its favorite news source. But the administration does risk the perception that it&#8217;s using the British scandal as an excuse for going after a news-media nemesis.</p> \n\n<p>The Justice Department and Congress aren&#8217;t the only entities under pressure to take action against News Corp. in light of the tabloid scandal. Earlier this week on an ABC panel discussion, media mogul Steven Brill <a href=\"http://www.fair.org/blog/\" type=\"external\">said</a>:</p> \n\n<p>News Corp has a lot of FCC licenses.

The book&#8217;s protagonist is a leader in the Italian Communist party who secretly returns from exile to the village where he was born with the intention of organizing the rural masses to revolt against Fascism. He barely makes it home before falling ill and his fevered musings grasp part of the dilemma of the modern person:</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;If only I could wake up tomorrow morning at dawn, put a stick to my donkey, and go the vineyard, Don Paolo said to himself. If I could go to sleep, and wake up, not only with healthy lungs, but with a normal brain, free of all intellectual abstractions. If I could only go back to a real, ordinary life. If I could dig, plow, sow, reap, earn my living, talk to the other men on Sundays, read and study; fulfill the law that says, &#8216;In the sweat of thy face thou shalt earn thy bread.&#8217; On further reflection Don Paolo decided that the root of his trouble lay in his infraction of that law- in the irregular life he had been living, in cafes, libraries, and hotels, in having rudely broken the chain that for centuries had bound his ancestors to the soil. He was an outlaw, not because he contravened the arbitrary laws of the party in power, but because of his infringement of that more ancient law, &#8216;In the sweat of thy face thou shalt earn thy bread.&#8217; He had ceased to be a peasant, and he had not become a townsman. It would never be possible for him to return to the soil. Still less would it be possible for him ever to forget it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Today it seems obvious that a return to the land, to a proper relationship with creation and to meaningful, productive work is integral to the aims of the Catholic Worker movement. For much of its history, however, since its beginning in 1933, this aspect of its founder&#8217;s original intentions was relegated to the margins of an already marginal movement.</p> \n\n<p>For the next eleven years after meeting Dorothy, I lived in Catholic Worker Houses of Hospitality in New York and then Davenport, Iowa, sharing meals and giving shelter to those in need. Peter Maurin&#8217;s visions of &#8220;agronomic universities&#8221; and return to a village based craft economy were not taken too seriously in those days and most of us, I think, would have been just as happy to dump these as slightly embarrassing and quaint anachronisms.</p> \n\n<p>Peter&#8217;s &#8220;Easy Essays&#8221; about Irish monks establishing salons de culture across medieval Europe did not seem relevant to our demanding work of offering hospitality, nor did his suggestion that in following these monks&#8217; example was the answer to global hunger and the threat of nuclear annihilation. We took Dorothy Day at her word that Peter Maurin was her mentor and co-founder of the movement but there was at the time little evidence of his influence in our life and work.</p> \n\n<p>Mel Piehl in his fine historical review of the Catholic Worker movement, Breaking Bread,1982, even quotes some Catholic Workers of an earlier era who suggested that Peter&#8217;s &#8220;intellectual genius was clearly exaggerated&#8221; and that Peter was uncomfortable in his &#8220;feigned role of leadership.&#8221; Piehl estimates that Dorothy Day had exaggerated Peter&#8217;s role as &#8220;co-founder&#8221; and that she &#8220;promoted the fiction that the Catholic Worker was simply an attempt to realize Peter Maurin&#8217;s &#8216;Idea.&#8217;&#8221; It was, Piehl said, &#8220;strategically useful to her as a woman leading a social movement in the sexually conservative Catholic Church, to be able to point to a male co-founder of the movement.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>For generations of young Americans attracted to Catholic Worker communities, the European peasant Peter Maurin might have appeared as obscure and incomprehensible as the very American radical Dorothy Day was accessible. Daniel Berrigan, in his introduction to Dorothy&#8217;s memoir, The Long Loneliness, published in 1981, a year after her death, reflected a common if less than generous perception of Peter and his vision: &#8220;They started a newspaper and the rest is history. They started houses of hospitality; that too is history. Peter was forever talking about something he called &#8216;agronomic universities.&#8217; They started one, on the land; and that is something less than history.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Dorothy&#8217;s announcement in The Catholic Worker in January 1936, &#8220;we are going to move out on a farm&#8230; and start there a true farming commune,&#8221; however, was clearly proclaimed with the expectation that history was being made: &#8220;We believe that our words will have more weight, our writings will have more conviction, if we ourselves are engaged in making a better life on the land.&#8221; While she assured her readers that &#8220;we are not going to abandon the city,&#8221; it is clear that Dorothy&#8217;s historic expectation was that the Catholic Worker was going to realize its original vision, that of a rural based &#8220;back to the land&#8221; movement keeping some presence in the city, &#8220;sending out apostles of labor from the farm, to scenes of industrial conflict, to factories and to lodging houses, to live and work with the poor.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>If this and other early experimental farming communes came and went as &#8220;something less than history,&#8221; as Dan offers, or as the abject failures that others have named them, the concept did continue to limp along somehow for the next decades. Rather than the cutting edge of a revolution as Peter envisioned the agronomic university, however, most Catholic Worker farms were planned and grew, if they did, as dependent branches of urban Catholic Worker houses of hospitality. Most of these few farms were seen even by those who lived and worked at them in an urban context, as auxiliaries, existing to provide cheap food for soup lines, hospitality for the urban poor and places for retreat and recreation for Catholic Workers from the city. Most were rural responses to urban poverty and homelessness with little regard to the poverty of their neighbors. By and by, the &#8220;true farming communes&#8221; originally proposed gave way to &#8220;retreat centers.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Some few here and there in the most obscure and remote places have always remembered and stood by Peter&#8217;s vision. These were often marginalized and misunderstood by the larger Catholic Worker movement as much as by their neighbors and the culture at large. When in 1986, Betsy Keenan and I moved with our children from the Catholic Worker hospitality house in Davenport, Iowa, to Maloy, a town of less than 30 souls just north of Iowa&#8217;s border with Missouri, many friends assumed that we had left the Catholic Worker movement. Some challenged us, what need is there for a soup line in so small a town? No soup line? What kind of Catholic Worker house are you? Whose farm are we, we were challenged, meaning what city house owns and controls our farm, assuming that the legitimate existence of any rural entity is bound to its tie to an urban one. About that time our good friend Chuck Trapkus included in his iconic &#8220;Catholic Worker Primer&#8221; a cartoon of a man in overalls holding a chicken and saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re Catholic Workers, too, don&#8217;t you forget it!&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Over the past 30 years there has been a great shift in understanding and respect for Peter&#8217;s vision and what it means. At one of the sporadically convened national Catholic Worker gatherings, I think that this was in 1987, a &#8220;round table&#8221; discussion of Peter&#8217;s agronomic university was attended by a few of us farmers and the most pressing question that surfaced from the few mildly curious others who wandered in was &#8220;why bother with a garden when we have more donated old vegetables from the market than we can ever sort out?&#8221; Since that time, there has been a resurgence in Peter&#8217;s dreams of farming communes in the movement. At more recent gatherings, roundtables on rural issues and Peter Maurin are among the liveliest and best attended and this, the fourth biannual national Catholic Worker gathering is the largest ever.</p> \n\n<p>This resurgence is evidenced not only in the unprecedented plethora of Catholic Worker farms around the country and abroad. It is also shown in the level of discussion given Peter and his ideas in the newspapers of the various houses. Peter&#8217;s influence is seen in the growth of urban gardens in the yards and vacant lots around our city houses. Catholic Worker cottage industries, such as carving spoons, repairing bicycles, making soap, all are examples of a growing movement.</p> \n\n<p>In Maloy each winter we host a craft retreat, when up to a dozen Catholic Workers from around the Midwest crowd into our farmhouse to join us and some neighbors to weave, make cheese, carve wood, dip candles, knit, make baskets, cook, eat, pray, dance and sing. We have fun but these sessions were not recreational in the conventional sense nor are we really &#8220;on retreat.&#8221; &amp;#160;These gatherings are the Catholic Worker movement going about some of its most serious business. As it happens, the craft retreat often gets scheduled just before or after the annual Witness Against Torture event in Washington, DC, an intense time of fasting and action to demand the closing of the prison at Guantanamo and the abolition of torture that I usually attend. In my mind, these two yearly events have melded into one continuum.</p> \n\n<p>This shift of paradigm has come in part, I think, as people who come to Catholic Worker houses are staying longer. While many still come to Worker houses to donate a &#8220;gap year&#8221; or two of their lives in service to the poor between college and &#8220;real life,&#8221; from the 1970s on, more and more came and stayed. It has been suggested that some of these moved out to farms looking for a better place to raise kids than an inner city house of hospitality. There may be something to that, but I offer that for many of us, living and working for years with the urban poor made us look deeper into the roots of the world&#8217;s problems and see that serving soup, good work that it is, is not enough. Speaking for myself, I needed to live in urban hospitality houses for many years before I could make any sense of Peter&#8217;s talk about revolution on the land.</p> \n\n<p>For many of us, too, solidarity work and travel to places exploited by economic and other kinds of colonialism brought us to see that Peter was right when he pointedly insisted that issues of war and peace always are, at the heart, issues of the land and its use. In New York City or Los Angeles as in Jerusalem or Mexico City or San Salvador, the peace and good order of society requires justice on the land. It strikes us, finally, that even the food that we serve on our soup lines that is donated or gleaned from dumpsters depends on slave labor and is grown in ways that cannot be sustained. When the peace for which we yearn and struggle finally comes and our global neighbors will no longer be forced by debt and oppression to clothe and feed us but will use their own labor, land and water to care for themselves, how then will we live?</p> \n\n<p>The crisis of climate change on our threshold, too, makes Peter&#8217;s dream of agrarian revolution look less like a medieval utopian fantasy and more like an urgent and rational plan for a new and sustainable social order of the future.</p> \n\n<p>Some criticize such changes in the movement as if they are evidence that we are losing our way. My perspective is that, with some growing pains, the Catholic Worker is rather finding its way now after so many years. &#8220;Our houses of hospitality are scarcely the kind of houses that Peter Maurin has envisioned in his plan for a new social order,&#8221; Dorothy Day wrote in her column in September 1942. &#8220;He recognizes that himself, and thinks in terms of the future to accomplish true centers of Catholic Action and rural centers such as he speaks of.&#8221; Perhaps it is true that Peter Maurin&#8217;s role as &#8220;co-founder&#8221; of the Catholic Worker was exaggerated in the past. If so, it might also be true that he is now posthumously growing into that role as the movement matures into the dynamic revolutionary social force it was meant to be.</p> \n\n<p>While I am gratified to see this revival, I must confess that, along with Silone&#8217;s Don Paolo, I am still a townsman and after three decades of rural living I am far more at home in the city, &#8220;in cafes, libraries, and hotels,&#8221; than I am on the farm and in the small town where I live. In recent years as a co-coordinator of Voices for Creative Nonviolence, I am spending about half my time on the farm, half on the road, often in cities in America and abroad, sometimes in war zones and in jails and prisons. Some friends assume that my time on the farm is a respite from the stresses of activism, but the opposite is true.

One only has to read a few sentences into &#8220;Revenge of the Nerds,&#8221; our piece on high school policy debaters, to realize how deep and long standing is Rove&#8217;s love of playing hardball:</p> \n\n<p>It would have been the spring of 1969, the Vietnam War in full swing, when a scrawny 18-year-old in a suit and tie and horn-rimmed glasses pushed a handcart stacked with 10 boxes into a classroom at Olympus High School, on the outskirts of Salt Lake City. Each shoebox was stuffed with four-by-six notecards pasted with evidence clipped from newspapers, magazines, and scholarly journals. As the young man and his partner unpacked their evidence on a small table at the front of the room, members of the other policy debate team looked on in horror. They&#8217;d only brought one shoebox.</p> \n\n<p>What they didn&#8217;t know was that 99 percent of the notecards in the Olympus team&#8217;s 10 shoeboxes were just props. Even at 18, the scrawny kid with the horn-rims understood the power of intimidation.&#8221;Rove didn&#8217;t just want to win,&#8221; James Moore and Wayne Slater write in their book Rove Exposed: How Bush&#8217;s Brain Fooled America. &#8220;He wanted the opponents destroyed. His worldview was clear even then. There was his team and the other team, and he would make the other team pay.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t a man that&#8217;s going to be content going back to Texas and raising chickens. And though the 2006 rout of the RNC may taken the bloom off Rove&#8217;s rose somewhat, &#8220;the architect&#8221; has still got to be a highly sought-after campaign consultant.

We&#8217;ve had Trump&#8217;s phone call with the president of Mexico. We&#8217;ve had Trump&#8217;s phone call now with the president of Philippines (that oddball, Duterte guy). What other phone calls? Trump, during the transition and his early days as president, there were actual transcripts &#8212; in some cases voice recordings &#8212; of Trump phone calls, right? Now, why has there never been a leak of any evidence that Trump colluded with Russia?</p> \n\n<p>If they have the kind of access where they can get transcripts and audio recordings of Trump&#8217;s calls with presidents of Mexico and the Philippines and wherever else, after all of this time, why is there no hard evidence of Trump colluding with the Russians or any of his associates? Well, the answer is obvious: because there wasn&#8217;t any. But here is an ongoing problem. YouGov published the results of a poll recently, and it contains some data that nobody &#8212; I think the <a href=\"http://www.mrctv.org/blog/poll-majority-democrats-still-believe-russia-tampered-vote\" type=\"external\">Media Research Center noticed this</a>.</p> \n\n<p>God bless them, but nobody else has, and it is very important. Yesterday, I spent quite a bit of time explaining the trouble the Democrats are in, and they are in trouble. They have so pushed this collusion theory, they have so pushed that the Russians &#8220;hacked the election.&#8221; That is a phrase: &#8220;Russia hacked the election.&#8221; You know what people who are not capable of critical thinking are going to think, knee-jerk reaction when you say that. You&#8217;re already a livid Democrat. You&#8217;re already ticked off because Hillary lost. You&#8217;re already mad at that.</p> \n\n<p>You hate Trump on general principles. And then Trump wins, and your friends start talking about collusion with the Russians. And then comes the very, very precise allegation that the Russians &#8220;hacked the election.&#8221; That&#8217;s different than the Russians colluded with Trump during the campaign. &#8220;Hacking the election.&#8221; A lot of people are gonna think that means that the Russians somehow found a way to tamper with the vote &#8212; voting machines, paper ballots. But since they don&#8217;t think critically, they&#8217;re not gonna take it any further. They&#8217;re just gonna accept &#8212; because of prejudice and bias &#8212; that the Russians hacked the election.</p> \n\n<p>Now, the Democrats have not been pushing that other than it&#8217;s primarily been the media that has been pushing that narrative, but it&#8217;s not as frequently pushed as the narrative of collusion. So now the Democrats are walking back impeachment. Al Franken literally had to tell voters yesterday Trump&#8217;s not gonna be impeached this month. There are only seven days left this month! What must those people believe? What must they be out there anticipating? Does this mean that Trump might be impeached next month if Franken&#8217;s not gonna get to it next week?</p> \n\n<p>So the results in the YouGov poll (ready for this?): 55% of Democrats think that it is probably or definitely true that Russia hacked vote totals to get Trump elected. Folks, this is not 55% who believe that the Russians colluded with Trump. This is 55% of Democrats who believe that the Russians actually hacked voting machines and that the election was literally stolen! Who has made them believe this? It&#8217;s their buddies in the mainstream media, followed by willing accomplices in the Democrat Party. There have been two memes: Russians colluded with Trump. Trump colluded with Russia.</p> \n\n<p>Despite the claims that there&#8217;s been no evidence found. That gets covered up and dwarfed by a year&#8217;s worth of stories featuring countless anonymous sources, former and current high-ranking government officials. Nevertheless, every story &#8212; practically every story, if you dug deep in it &#8212; would admit that, so far, there&#8217;s no evidence. But these Democrats never got that far. So when you&#8217;ve got&#8230; Imagine yourself. You&#8217;re the Democrat Party leadership, and you&#8217;re already in a mess&#8230; Do you know that Jane Sanders, Crazy Bernie&#8217;s wife, is out there praising the Iranian election as a model for us to learn from?</p> \n\n<p>The Iranians elected a new president last week, Rouhani, and Crazy Bernie&#8217;s wife is out there saying, &#8220;That&#8217;s the kind of model we need to be following, the way the Iranians do elections.&#8221; Now, wait. Before you go off on this, remember what happened to her husband. He was cheated. The Democrat Party indeed rigged the primary against her husband. She knows it; her husband knows it; and Crazy Bernie voters suspect it, and there&#8217;s a lawsuit about it. There&#8217;s real tampering, by the way. There&#8217;s real hacking, by the way. There&#8217;s real collusion.</p> \n\n<p>It happened on the Democrat side. Now, Jane Sanders is a mess anyway. Self-contained mess. But on this you can&#8217;t really blame her. Her husband&#8217;s campaign was sabotaged by her husband&#8217;s opponent and Debbie &#8220;Blabbermouth&#8221; Schultz and the rest of the DNC. So imagine you&#8217;re a Democrat, any Democrat &#8212; you&#8217;re Chuck Schumer, you&#8217;re Pelosi, you&#8217;re a Democrat lobbyist, you are in the Drive-By Media &#8212; and you have been trying to destroy Donald Trump. With who, by the way? With who have you been trying to destroy Trump?</p> \n\n<p>You don&#8217;t need to destroy Trump in the minds of Democrats. They already hate Trump. Democrats don&#8217;t need convincing that Trump is bad news. They don&#8217;t need to constantly be told what a danger Trump is. Trump voters are the targets of this. The media&#8217;s been trying to distance Trump voters from Trump by impugning his character and his honesty and his legitimacy and all of that. But it the audience that&#8217;s heard it is also Democrat base voters.</p> \n\n<p>So the Democrats are thinking that their voters are far too sophisticated to really know what&#8217;s going on here, so it&#8217;s a wink and nod and they&#8217;ll be in the game. No, no, no. They&#8217;re buying this. There are now 55% of Democrat voters think the Russians stole election by hacking voting machines or whatever they think the mechanism was. Now, those people, because they believe that, are convinced that Comey knows it. They were convinced that Sally Yates knows it. They are convinced that Mueller is going to find it!</p> \n\n<p>They&#8217;re convinced that Eric Holder and Obama and John Brennan know it. So, therefore, they are convinced that it&#8217;s going to be made public in an investigation, and they are convinced that Trump may go to jail. They are convinced. They are just waiting for all of it to unfold and happen. Al Franken had to tell &#8217;em it wasn&#8217;t gonna happen this month. This is a problem for Democrats, &#8217;cause this isn&#8217;t gonna happen, because that didn&#8217;t happen. The Russians did not hack the election. The Russians had nothing to do with the outcome of the election!</p> \n\n<p>That&#8217;s all on Hillary. And one day, these people are gonna have to told. One day these people are gonna figure out there isn&#8217;t gonna be an investigation. One day&#8230; Well, there isn&#8217;t gonna be the revelation, and there isn&#8217;t gonna be a conviction, and there isn&#8217;t gonna be a frog march in handcuffs of Donald Trump to the nearest jail. There isn&#8217;t gonna be Donald Trump lined up before a firing squad. This isn&#8217;t gonna happen. And when it doesn&#8217;t, when these 55% and growing figure out that there&#8217;s nothing here, what are they gonna do?</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;m telling you: The Democrats are scared to death of that day.</p> \n\n<p>BREAK TRANSCRIPT</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: Now, YouGov, this poll that shows 55% of Democrats think that it&#8217;s pretty true that Russia tampered with vote totals. They did the question back in December too. In December the number was 52%. Now, think about that. In December. This is still during the Trump transition. In December, 52% of Democrat voters believed the Russians tampered with the vote. Ballots that were cast were tampered with by the Russians. Last week they did the same poll, 55%. So the number is growing. The number is expanding.</p> \n\n<p>I think this poll is one of the reasons why so many Democrats are now starting to walk back this whole notion of impeachment. And now a couple more have joined the chorus and are saying not only is there not gonna be any impeachment this year, there isn&#8217;t gonna be any impeachment, period. They&#8217;re tiptoeing with it, they&#8217;re whispering it. They have to do this gradually. This is like withdrawing these people off of a very, very addictive drug. They can&#8217;t take &#8217;em off this cold turkey or who knows what they&#8217;ll do. They&#8217;re having to walk this back very, very slowly.</p>", "title": "Poll: Majority of Democrat Voters Think Russians Hacked Voting", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2017/05/24/poll-majority-of-democrat-voters-think-russians-hacked-voting/", "published_at": "2017-05-24", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>On June 22, the Paraguayan Congress <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">impeached</a> President Fernando Lugo, a progressive who assumed office in 2008. Although <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">technically legal</a>, Lugo&#8217;s removal threatens the very integrity of democracy in Paraguay. It is the latest in a disconcerting series of attacks against progressive governments in South America that highlights the vulnerability of its nascent democratic institutions and calls into question the trend of democratization in the region.</p> \n\n<p>Lugo&#8217;s victorious election campaign was historic. It ended more than 60 years of dominance by the Colorado Party. This right-wing coalition of landed and military elites used violence and coercion to dominate Paraguay through the extensive state bureaucracy created by dictator Alfredo Strossner, a Colorado strongman who ruled from 1954 to 1989. The Party&#8217;s legitimacy gradually eroded through its land-grabs and corruption scandals involving high-level officials. It was also <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">implicated</a> in political assassinations, most notably that of Vice President Luis Maria Argana in 1999, after which President Raul Cubas was forced to resign and flee the country.</p> \n\n<p>Lugo, a progressive who proposed numerous social reforms, was widely known in Paraguay as the &#8220;bishop of the poor.&#8221; Pledging to fight corruption, reduce poverty, and enact agrarian reform in a country where 38 percent of people live in poverty and <a href=\"http://www.mag.gov.py/\" type=\"external\">2 percent</a> of the population controls 75 percent of fertile land, Lugo won 41 percent of the popular vote in 2008, beating out the Colorado candidate by 10 percentage points. Despite this electoral success, the conservative legislature and the tenuous coalition of center-right parties that helped bring him to power systematically <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">frustrated</a> Lugo&#8217;s progressive efforts at reform.</p> \n\n<p>The Impeachment</p> \n\n<p>Lugo was impeached on grounds of &#8220; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">malfeasance</a>&#8221; after 17 people were killed in a clash between police and landless squatters protesting land inequality. This legal formality, however, obscures the fact that Lugo&#8217;s ouster, long-desired by those who opposed his democratic reforms, was politically motivated.</p> \n\n<p>A leaked <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">2009 U.S. diplomatic cable</a> claimed that the &#8220;shared goal&#8221; of General Lino Oviedo and ex-President Nicanor Frutos, both Colorado party members, was &#8220;to change the current political equation, break the political deadlock in Congress, impeach Lugo and regain their own political relevance.&#8221; The cable, which was classified as &#8220;secret,&#8221; includes this prophetic sentence: &#8220;Oviedo&#8217;s dream scenario involves legally impeaching Lugo, even if on spurious grounds.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>South American governments from all across the political spectrum <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">immediately condemned</a> Lugo&#8217;s abrupt removal (he was given less than 24 hours notice and just <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">two hours</a> to defend himself). <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Mercosur</a> suspended Paraguay and refused to recognize the new government. Venezuela unilaterally halted all fuel shipments to Asuncion. Brazil and Mexico withdrew their ambassadors, as did Colombia, whose president, Juan Manuel Santos, is a staunch conservative. Argentina&#8217;s President Cristina Fernandez Kirchner publicly called Lugo&#8217;s impeachment a &#8220;coup d&#8217;&#233;tat.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Regional Trend?</p> \n\n<p>The removal of Lugo is particularly disturbing because it is the latest in a series of actions against progressive populist governments in Latin America. In a <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">2009 coup</a>, democratically elected Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, who had raised the national <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">minimum wage</a> despite strong opposition from the business elite, was removed at gunpoint. In 2010, Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa was tear-gassed, assaulted, and held captive by insurgent police officers in an <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">attempted coup</a> that ended in a shootout.</p> \n\n<p>An international <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">fact-finding team</a> arrived in Asuncion on Monday to collect information on the events leading up to the impeachment, Lugo&#8217;s satellite government, and the major players in the recent events. The U.S. <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g_6v2H3TMGUm_lvNuS9ToDbUhNxA?docId=CNG.239964f1ca5382554f694a8a3bbf2d84.3b1\" type=\"external\">State Department</a> said it was &#8220;quite concerned&#8221; about the rapidity of Lugo&#8217;s impeachment. The United States is unlikely to take a more definitive stance until the OAS team submits its report in the coming days.</p> \n\n<p>One thing is certain: few people want a repeat of what happened in Honduras. Since the 2009 coup, political dissidents have been assassinated, minorities have been targeted, and violence and disorder have ensued. <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Honduras</a> now has the world&#8217;s highest homicide rate.</p> \n\n<p>The fact-finding mission&#8217;s report should elucidate the details of a political upheaval that remains opaque. So far, there is no indication that any outside powers played a role in the coup.</p> \n\n<p>The impeachment&#8217;s rapidity and the vote&#8217;s unprecedented margin (in the House of Representatives, the vote was 73 in favor and 1 against impeachment) suggest that Lugo&#8217;s impeachment was not a response to his &#8220;malfeasance&#8221; surrounding the killings by the police. It was coordinated and politically motivated, likely by domestic landowning and business elites, with powerful allies in Congress, who opposed Lugo&#8217;s progressive agenda and preferred a return to the right-wing Colorado party.</p> \n\n<p>Ironically, the state that has benefitted the most from Lugo&#8217;s ouster may be Venezuela.

People just started businesses and ran companies. That&#8217;s what they did, so that&#8217;s what they identified with. Their jobs. Their work. Their companies. Not labels.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>To my knowledge, that hasn&#8217;t changed. But somehow, right under our very noses, emerged a massively overhyped fad made up of crazed zealots and opportunists that are essentially co-opting and capitalizing on the most critical function in the business world: those who start and run companies.</p> \n\n<p>Today we have countless authors, bloggers, coaches, academics and gurus &#8211; self-proclaimed experts who, with rare exception, have never actually run a business or led a real company. And yet, without any first-hand experience, they&#8217;ve become preachers on a subject they have absolutely no visceral feel for.</p> \n\n<p>Let me tell you why that&#8217;s an issue. Building a business into a thriving enterprise is not a skill you&#8217;re born with. It&#8217;s not a discipline you can learn in school. And while you can learn the fundamentals &#8211; the various functions of how a business operates &#8211; getting good at it is almost entirely experiential.</p> \n\n<p>Now, here&#8217;s where this gets interesting. If you read books by some of the great management consultants and CEOs of our time &#8211; Peter Drucker, Andy Grove, and Mark McCormack, to name a few &#8211; you won&#8217;t find words like &#8220;leadership&#8221; and &#8220;entrepreneurship&#8221; thrown around a lot because they&#8217;re fairly amorphous terms.</p> \n\n<p>No wonder we now have an enormous underclass of self-described entrepreneurs and leaders &#8211; CEOs of one-person companies. A more accurate description is that they&#8217;re self-employed. They&#8217;ve abandoned the labor force by the millions, which is why we actually have the lowest workforce participation rate and fewest new business starts in three decades.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>It seems the more we talk about entrepreneurship and leadership &#8211; not just talk but also generate, consume and propagate enormous amounts of content and communication &#8211; the less we actually do about it. No wonder. Everyone&#8217;s too busy blogging, reading, commenting, tweeting, sharing, posting and liking to get much done.</p> \n\n<p>A couple of months ago, Stanford University business professor <a href=\"http://jeffreypfeffer.com\" type=\"external\">Jeffrey Pfeffer Opens a New Window.</a> published a book called &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.harpercollins.com/9780062383167/leadership-bs\" type=\"external\">Leadership BS: Fixing Workplaces and Careers One Truth at a Time Opens a New Window.</a>.&#8221; Pfeffer&#8217;s premise is that what he calls &#8220;the multibillion dollar leadership industry&#8221; has done little to improve executive careers, toxic workplaces and employee engagement.</p> \n\n<p>Of course that&#8217;s true. What&#8217;s also true is that amateurs now dominate the leadership genre and the content they generate is overwhelmingly BS. After all, the vast majority of information and communication propagated through blogs and social media is user-generated content dominated by popular myths, feel-good fads, inspirational fluff and pseudoscience.</p> \n\n<p>But this issue goes so much deeper than that. Of course we&#8217;d all like our bosses to be effective people managers instead of dysfunctional tyrants who rose to their level of incompetence via the Peter Principle. We&#8217;d like them to be more motivating, empowering and respectful, rather than the abusive, egotistical jerks we so often find at the top.</p> \n\n<p>There&#8217;s just one problem with that. We all want happy marriages, parents who are supportive and wise, families that don&#8217;t resemble dystopian sitcoms, communities where everyone gets along and cultures that aren&#8217;t divided by political factions and civil wars. What in the world makes us think we can control how our companies work when we can&#8217;t control how any other organization of two or more people functions?</p> \n\n<p>Every organization on Earth is a construct of man and a function of the human condition, meaning it&#8217;s more about human psychology and relationships than anything else. As long as there are dysfunctional individuals and differences among us, there will be dysfunctional families, organizations, communities, cities, nations and yes, companies and their cultures.</p> \n\n<p>That&#8217;s why the same ideals that built a great culture can also build great companies. Concepts like freedom, meritocracy, competition, personal accountability and transparency are all critical to free markets. Employees thrive at companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) because they&#8217;re built on a foundation of principles that are very similar to those that built this nation.</p> \n\n<p>But there&#8217;s a catch. Even if CEOs could know all there is to know about business, markets, products, technology, finance, economics and management, there&#8217;s still a complex set of variables we simplistically call the human element that determines how they run their companies. And you simply can&#8217;t regulate or legislate that or risk losing what makes free markets work.</p> \n\n<p>Truth is, of the hundreds of successful founders, executives and VCs I&#8217;ve known over the decades, none ever attributed their accomplishments to a book, a coach, a professor or an inspirational speaker. It&#8217;s all about smarts, guts, good behavior, smart decisions and experience. And while they all had mentors who helped them along the way, they were those who came before them, not amateurs with fancy labels.</p>", "title": "Calling BS on the Leadership Business", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2015/11/17/calling-bs-on-leadership-business.html", "published_at": "2016-03-04", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Bad products, horrible software and no cohesive vision have seemingly turned Research In Motion into a company without motion at this point.

He told us that RIM is betting its business on a platform and ecosystem that isn&#8217;t even as good as iPhone OS 1.0 or Android 2.0. &#8220;There&#8217;s no room for a fourth ecosystem,&#8221; he stated, &#8220;and DingleBerry also works on BlackBerry 10.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bgr.com/2011/12/22/blackberry-10-is-a-failure-that-wont-be-able-to-compete-company-source-says/\" type=\"external\">This content was originally published on BGR.com Opens a New Window.</a></p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.bgr.com/\" type=\"external\">Opens a New Window.</a>More news from BGR:</p>", "title": "BlackBerry 10 a Failure That Won\u2019t Be Able to Compete: Company Source", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2011/12/21/blackberry-10-failure-that-wont-be-able-to-compete-company-source.html", "published_at": "2016-03-04", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>The Federal Reserve report on Americans&#8217; finances documents the terrible damage the Great Recession has inflicted on the nation, a toll that has been clear to its victims since the collapse began. The report&#8217;s dry language doesn&#8217;t begin to describe how bad things really are, and it stops short of blaming those who perpetuate the misery.</p> \n\n<p>In pursuing this story since 2007, I and other journalists have seen foreclosed homes and visited unemployment offices, free food distributions, community health centers and mental health counselors. Former donors were now coming to free health clinics and food banks to get help themselves, an experience that will be forever remembered by their families. Lost homes, jobs and hopes are the legacy of this period.</p> \n\n<p>The presidential campaign doesn&#8217;t reflect the urgency the situation demands. Republican Mitt Romney has nothing to offer except blaming President Barack Obama and joining with House Republicans in opposing presidential initiatives. Obama has some solutions, but doesn&#8217;t know how to sell them. The president had a chance last week when disappointing employment figures came out. Unfortunately at his news conference Friday, he reminded me of a bored university economics professor lecturing to an equally bored freshman class, not the nation&#8217;s leader who is in real danger of losing his office.</p> \n\n<p>The Federal Reserve survey reported on consumers&#8217; economic status from 2007, when the economy began to falter, to 2010, when the slow recovery began.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>A family in the economic middle, between rich and poor, saw its net worth &#8212; the difference between gross assets and liabilities &#8212; drop almost 40 percent between 2007 and 2010. That brought the figure, the report said, &#8220;close to levels not seen since the 1992 survey.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The recession hit everybody. &#8220;Net worth decreased for all education groups,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;Each of the four education groups experienced a very large decline &#8230; ranging from a drop of 53.7 percent for the no-high-school-diploma group to a drop of 32.7 percent for the high-school-educated group.&#8221; The declines were even lower for college graduates and those with some college. The net worth of people of color decreased more than that of whites.</p> \n\n<p>As Obama talked about the weak economy at the news conference, he said the private sector was &#8220;doing fine.&#8221; It was the public sector dragging things down. It was an unfortunate way to put it, but Obama actually had it right.</p> \n\n<p>Ben Polak, chairman of the economics department at Yale, and Peter Schott, a Yale School of Management professor, wrote in The New York Times Economix blog that &#8220;recovery in the private sector has not been particularly slow by recent historical standards. &#8230; But there is something historically different about this recession and its aftermath: In the past, local government employment has been almost recession-proof. This time it&#8217;s not. Going back as long as the data have been collected (1955), with the one exception of the 1981 recession, local government employment continued to grow almost every month regardless of what the economy threw at it. But since the latest recession began, local government employment has fallen by 3 percent, and is still falling.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Part of the problem is local governments&#8217; practice, during the good years, of agreeing to overly generous retirement and health benefits. But the federal government has also failed to help local governments with aid to prevent more employee layoffs and financing for their public works projects.</p> \n\n<p>Take, for example, a job-creating bill that has been stalled in the House by Republicans. The measure would finance transportation projects around the country. &#8220;Clearly, the indecision in passing a transportation reauthorization bill is having a terrible impact on the construction industry &#8212; 28,000 construction jobs lost last month,&#8221; said the author of the Senate-passed bill, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif.</p> \n\n<p>Every day, I see what good such proposals do. Four blocks from my house in Los Angeles, workers are widening one of the nation&#8217;s most jammed roads, Interstate 405. About a mile away, other workers are building the Expo commuter rail line, part of an expanding network. Without much media emphasis on the job aspect, these projects are already putting people to work in a county where unemployment is 11 percent, down during the Obama administration from a 2010 high of 13.4 percent. Many miles away, workers have started on the Gold Line commuter rail extension through the San Gabriel Valley, which business interests there say will create 2,630 construction jobs and 4,270 more in businesses related to the project. After watching the misery of the recession, it&#8217;s heartening to see men and women working on the roads and rail lines.</p> \n\n<p>These are being financed by a local sales tax. Boxer wants to permit the federal government to loan money to local authorities to speed up work on such transportation projects. In Los Angeles County, proceeds from the sales tax would repay the loans.</p> \n\n<p>This is just one program. There are others, blocked by House Republicans and opposed by Romney. Although they are not mentioned in the Federal Reserve report, these recalcitrant legislators &#8212; whose only goal is to defeat Obama, even at the cost of average Americans&#8217; well-being &#8212; are the villains in this story.</p>", "title": "Who's Not Putting Americans Back to Work", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/whos-not-putting-americans-back-to-work/", "published_at": "2012-06-15", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>The <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">White House</a> has been touting its proposed &#8220;Framework for Business Tax Reform&#8221; as a way to cut the corporate tax rate and eliminate loopholes and subsidies and strengthen American manufacturing and spur innovation all. The administration also touts it will simplify and cut taxes for small businesses, and encourage domestic investment.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>What&#8217;s not to love?</p> \n\n<p>Plenty, perhaps.</p> \n\n<p>Whether you end up on the winning or losing side of this reform depends upon politics. In other words, are you one of the industries favored by this president? Alternative energy, for instance? There&#8217;s a tax incentive for that. Manufacturer? Your top tax rate will be lower than a service provider&#8217;s.</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;m not na&#239;ve. I recognize that the tax code is full of incentives that encourage both individuals and businesses to act in ways deemed to be positive or socially enhancing. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s a tax deduction for charitable donations.&amp;#160; I also acknowledge that our current tax code is overly complex, and that many aspects are outdated. I just don&#8217;t see how replacing old &#8220;preferences&#8221; with new ones is an improvement.</p> \n\n<p>And let&#8217;s be honest: Although the top corporate tax rate is currently 35%, many companies don&#8217;t pay anything close to that under the current system. <a href=\"http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/The-Presidents-Framework-for-Business-Tax-Reform-02-22-2012.pdf\" type=\"external\">According to the Treasury Department Opens a New Window.</a>, after taking deductions, writeoffs and other tax breaks into account, the &#8220;effective&#8221; tax rate a company pays varies widely, depending upon the business it&#8217;s in:</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Source: U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Tax Analysis based upon 2007-2008 data</p> \n\n<p>In addition to lowering the maximum corporate tax rate to 28%, the administration would eliminate most of the tax breaks businesses currently receive. So many, in fact, that they more than makes up for the reduction in the tax rate.&amp;#160; &#8220;The president&#8217;s proposal is designed to be a net revenue raiser,&#8221; according to Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at CCH, a global provider of tax information and software.&amp;#160; &#8220;When you start eliminating a whole range of tax breaks, it adds up&#8230; Overall, there will be more paid.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>And, while it seems unfair that utilities pay an effective federal tax rate of just 14%, what&#8217;s going to happen to your monthly utility bill if your electric company suddenly has to pay twice that amount?&amp;#160; The same goes for car insurance. Moreover, why should the top tax rate on corporations be 28% except for those involved in manufacturing? (I&#8217;m sure it has nothing to with the fact that many are staffed by union workers.)</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;On the international side,&#8221; says Luscombe, &#8220;Obama has backed away from a territorial say system and is moving toward a worldwide system. This would be a significant development.&#8221; Nonetheless, since most of our trading partners operate on a territorial system of taxation, this wouldn&#8217;t exactly put U.S. companies on an equal footing. In effect, the president&#8217;s &#8220;Framework&#8221; would require companies to pay tax on overseas profits in the year the money is earned as opposed to when it is actually brought back to this country.&amp;#160; However, since a company could offset this by any tax paid to the foreign country in which they&#8217;re located, there could be minimal impact.</p> \n\n<p>To stem the loss of jobs overseas, companies would no longer be allowed to deduct the cost of moving operations outside the U.S.&amp;#160; In addition, there would be a tax credit for companies that bring jobs back home.</p> \n\n<p>Interestingly, as CCH points out, the &#8220;Framework&#8221; proposal does not address the double taxation of dividends whereby profits are taxed at the corporate level and again when received by investors. The president&#8217;s budget proposal for 2013 would eliminate the current tax rate on qualified dividends- a maximum of 15%- but just for so-called &#8220;wealthy&#8221; taxpayers.&amp;#160; As the law stands now, starting Jan. 1, these investors will pay up to 39.6% tax on dividends and other types of investment income.&amp;#160; In Luscombe&#8217;s words, &#8220;A 28% corporate tax and a 39.6% [personal] tax in combination is not very attractive.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Consider the impact on the stock market.</p> \n\n<p>As for the hoopla about incentives to help small businesses, &#8220;There&#8217;s nothing new here,&#8221; says Luscomb. Basically, the administration&#8217;s proposal would increase the amount of equipment that could be written off to $1 million (it&#8217;s due to revert to $125,000 next year) and make this permanent.&amp;#160; It would also expand the use of the so-called &#8220;cash method&#8221; of accounting and give businesses with up to 50 employees (instead of a max of 25) a tax credit to help offset the cost of mandatory health insurance.</p> \n\n<p>There&#8217;s lots more to The President&#8217;s Framework for Business Tax Reform . The U.S. Chamber of Commerce opposes the entire package. If read it yourself, one thing you&#8217;ll notice is the amount of specifics that are missing. For instance, there&#8217;s no information on what the minimum tax on overseas profits would be. And, as Luscombe points out, &#8220;It&#8217;s probably not something you have to worry about right away.&#8221; If we end up with a different president next year, this is pretty much D.O.A.

He can then immediately tell Social Security to suspend that benefit. This allows hisspouse to draw a spousal benefit, which is half of what the first spouse's benefit would have been.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>The non-filing spouse can file an application for restricted benefits -- a restricted application for <a href=\"http://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/protect-spousal-benefits-bank-government-mistakes/\" type=\"external\">Social Security spousal benefits Opens a New Window.</a> -- based on the first spouse's suspended benefit. The suspended benefit will continue to draw delayed credits and grow until the person reaches age 70, at which time he could resume hisbenefit. Likewise, the spouse drawing the spousal benefit can let herown benefit grow until age 70 at which time that spouse could switch to herown benefit if it is larger than the Social Security spousal benefit, or continue to draw the spousal benefit.</p> \n\n<p>How file-and-suspend and restricted application work togetherInvestment advisor representative and president of <a href=\"http://mainstayfg.com/\" type=\"external\">Mainstay Financial Group Opens a New Window.</a>Annalee Leonard gave the example of the Social Security eligibility of a married couple with both spouses aged 66 and the husband as the higher-wage earner:</p> \n\n<p>\"It'd be much better for him if he can wait till 70 to take his Social Security and let's suppose he's still working and putting into it -- even more reason to wait till 70,\"Leonard said. If the husband were to file and immediately suspend his benefit, his wife could then go in and file for spousal benefit. If the husband's benefit at that stage is $2,000, the wife would get $1,000 per month as her spousal benefit.</p> \n\n<p>\"Now that's good if her benefit would be only $800 a month, but let's suppose her benefit is higher and she wants to keep working. She can go file and suspend, she can collect on his, she can still be putting into hers, and at 70 they both switch to their own benefits and give themselves a raise -- you can't do that anymore.\"</p> \n\n<p>The following table is based on Leonard's example, using the assumption that the wife's own benefit is $1,000 per month and that each person lives to age 90. Putting off receiving Social Security checks until age 70 generally provides a 25% increase in Social Security benefits -- which would mean a delayed benefit of $2,500 per month for the husband and $1,250 for the wife in this example.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Note the significant difference in total Social Security retirement benefits received if the couple uses the file-and-suspend with restricted application, or uses the file-and-suspend strategy only, or chooses to file and begin collecting benefits at the Social Security retirement age of 66:</p> \n\n<p>This strategy of using both the Social Securityfile-and-suspend rule and a restricted application can add $60,000 or more to a couple's Social Security earnings over the four years between their full retirement age and age 70. But now that the Bipartisan Budget Bill will be going into effect, many couples will lose out on this.</p> \n\n<p>Why the file-and-suspend rules have changedThe reason behind the change in the file-and-suspend rules is that this strategy is viewed as a loophole in the Social Security program. By disallowing the current filing strategy, Congress is focused on saving money and tightening any existing gray areas.</p> \n\n<p>\"Social Security faces a deficit over the next 75 years. That's why they're making changes,\"Leonard said.\"File-and-suspend was never supposed to be used the way it turned out being used.They never really meant it to be that you file, you stop, the spouse claims, then you claim again later. That was never the original intention.\"</p> \n\n<p>In order to understand how the changes will affect the way you and your spousefile for Social Security benefits, you need to know the details of the changes and how the updates will work. Here are the most important things you need to know about the updated rules and what you can do to enjoy the maximum Social Security benefitwhile staying within the law.</p> \n\n<p>1. Some people can still use the file-and-suspend strategyIf you have already filedand suspended with a restricted application, you're fine; there will be no changes to your status or benefits.Some workers will still be able to take advantage of the strategy, as it remains available to workers to either have already turned 66 or who will do so before May 1, 2016.Couples who will both have reached their full retirement age can stillfile and suspend with a restricted application for spousal benefits on or before April 29, 2016.</p> \n\n<p>2. Suspending benefits will work differentlyAfter April 29, 2016, if you suspend your benefits you are also suspending the ability of a spouse or anyone else to claim a benefit based on your work record. Additionally, the ability to file and suspend Social Security benefits and then reinstate them -- to later change your mind and receive retroactive benefits back to the date you suspended -- will be gone.</p> \n\n<p>The original intent of thefile-and-suspend strategywill remain. For example, if you retired and filed for your benefit, then later returned to work, you can suspend your benefit and later resume when desired.</p> \n\n<p>3. Limitations for people born in 1953 or earlierYou will still have the option to suspend your benefits with the limitations outlined in the prior section if you were born in 1953 or earlier. However, there are some limitations.</p> \n\n<p>For instance, if you've already suspended or will suspend your benefits before April 30, 2016, the suspension will allow your spouse to continue collectingSocial Securityspousal benefits. This will continue as your own benefit accrues, explainedfinancial advisorJim Blankenshipof <a href=\"http://financialducksinarow.com/\" type=\"external\">Financial Ducks in a Row Opens a New Window.</a>. \"In addition, you will continue to have the option of changing your mind and receiving retroactive benefits to any point at or after your suspension date,\" he said.</p> \n\n<p>If your spouse has filed for benefits -- and is receiving those benefits -- you might still be able to file a restricted application and receive a spousal benefit based on his or herearnings. If they have filed and suspended you will not be eligible to receive a spousal benefit while his or her benefit is suspended after April 29, 2016.</p> \n\n<p>However, you will still have the option to file a restricted application for a spousal benefit once you reach your full retirement age if your spouse filed and suspended on or before April 29, 2016, or is drawing his or herown benefit at that time.</p> \n\n<p>4.Limitations for people born in 1954 or laterThe same rules apply for the suspension of benefits if you were born in 1954 or later. If you suspend your benefits, your spouse or any other family member will not be able to receive a benefit based upon your earnings.</p> \n\n<p>A change in the deemed filing rules effectively eliminates the restricted Social Security application for those born in 1954 or later. Deemed filing means that if you file for a spousal benefit under anyone's earning record, you are deemed to have filed for all benefits available to you -- including your own. This eliminates the ability to file a restricted application for a spousal benefit and no longer allows your own benefit to grow and accrue delayed credits until a later date.</p> \n\n<p>5. Impact on divorced couplesIn addition to <a href=\"http://www.gobankingrates.com/checking-accounts/6-reasons-joint-bank-account-good-marriage/\" type=\"external\">married couples Opens a New Window.</a>, these new rules will have an <a href=\"http://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/5-ways-divorce-can-affect-credit-score/\" type=\"external\">impact on divorced couples Opens a New Window.</a>. If you were born in 1953 or earlier, and still have the ability to use a restricted application, you have an advantage.</p> \n\n<p>You will still be able to file a restricted application to receive a spousal benefit from your ex-spouse's earnings. However, if you file this restricted application after April 29, 2016, and your ex-spouse files and suspends, he or she will not be able to draw a benefit for his or herearnings.</p> \n\n<p>If you're a divorcee and were born in 1954 or later, the deemed filing rules will take effect. This essentially eliminates your ability to do a restricted application based upon your ex-spouse's earnings and allows your ex'sbenefit to grow until age 70.</p> \n\n<p>6. Impact on widows and widowersThere does not seem to be any impact on you <a href=\"http://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/handle-finances-lose-spouse/\" type=\"external\">if you have been widowed Opens a New Window.</a>. You will still have the option to file a restricted application to receive a survivor's benefit, or your own benefit, while letting the other benefit grow via deferred credits. At age 70 or younger, you'll retain the option to convert to the other type of benefit if that is more advantageous.</p> \n\n<p>Currently, Supplemental Security Income also remains unaffected.</p> \n\n<p>7. When delaying your benefit still makes senseThe answer of when to delay benefits varies from case to case.This is especially true for the spouse with the higher earnings record and benefit record. If this applies to you, it will still make sense for you to <a href=\"http://www.gobankingrates.com/retirement/42-ways-save-retirement/\" type=\"external\">delay taking your benefit Opens a New Window.</a> as long as possible. The earnings difference between taking a benefit at 62 and waiting until your full retirement age is approximately 25%; and the difference in waiting longer from your full retirement age to age 70 is an increase of about 8% per year.</p> \n\n<p>Not only would this increase your spouse's benefit, but a survivor's benefit would increase as well.As for the spouse with the smaller benefit level -- especially if the difference is significant -- it might make sense for them to apply for Social Security before age 70. As with many things in the world of financial planning, it really depends on your specific circumstances.</p> \n\n<p>Smart alternative strategies for maximizing Social Security benefitsBeyond Social Security claiming strategies, couples who might have used this strategy will need to rethink their pre-retirement financial planning, especially for those within a few years of retirement. But here are a few things you should consider:</p> \n\n<p>Understanding the changes around the file-and-suspend and restricted application strategies can help you decide what traditional or alternative strategies are right for you, but professional help might be key to maximizing your benefits.If you'replanning for retirement, now more than ever you should consider seeking the advice of a qualified financial advisor to help you navigate Social Security and all aspects of your retirement financial plan.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.gobankingrates.com/author/ruths/\" type=\"external\">Ruth Sarreal Opens a New Window.</a> contributed to the reporting for this article.</p> \n\n<p>This article originally appeared at <a href=\"http://www.gobankingrates.com/retirement/7-things-couples-need-know-social-security-filing-changes/\" type=\"external\">GoBankingRates Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>The article <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/retirement/general/2016/03/28/changes-to-social-security-spousal-benefits-you-ne.aspx\" type=\"external\">Changes to Social Security Spousal Benefits You Need to Know Opens a New Window.</a> originally appeared on Fool.com.</p> \n\n<p>Try any of our Foolish newsletter services <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/shop/newsletters/index.aspx?source=eptfxblnk0000004\" type=\"external\">free for 30 days Opens a New Window.</a>.

It can seem so intimidating that it&#8217;s often difficult to decide where to begin or even what kind of business to open. The first step is to explore your passions.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>If there is anything you throw your heart and soul into, that&#8217;s where your business might be, though you might want to think twice about having your favorite activities become a professional endeavor. If you know you want to become an entrepreneur, but you&#8217;re not sure what kind, here are a few of the best small businesses for beginners:</p> \n\n<p>Sell your stuff online. First-time business owners should consider the Internet to start a businesses because it has low overhead. Maintaining a website is significantly cheaper than renting&amp;#160;retail space, and the Internet is the fastest-growing marketplace.&amp;#160;You can sell almost anything, from&amp;#160;albums and jewelry to&amp;#160;vintage clothes. If you want to start even smaller than your own website,&amp;#160;you can open up&amp;#160;a store on wider platforms like <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/\" type=\"external\">eBay Opens a New Window.</a>and <a href=\"http://amazon.com\" type=\"external\">Amazon.com Opens a New Window.</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.etsy.com\" type=\"external\">Etsy Opens a New Window.</a>, which&amp;#160;specializes in handmade and vintage goods.</p> \n\n<p>Start a clean-up crew. Luckily, cleaning up is a skill that will never require a business degree. You can start your own home-cleaning service, taking on as few or as many clients as you would like. Cleaning services are also relatively low-cost businesses to start, and the time commitment is generally flexible. There may already be a lot of&amp;#160;competition for cleaners in your neighborhood. If that&#8217;s the case, you could still squeeze yourself into the market by offering specialized services such as construction cleanup.</p> \n\n<p>Open a child care center. If you love kids, running a child care center may be the business for you. Parents usually form strong networks, which means your business could grow rapidly by word of mouth. While starting a child care center usually costs less than other enterprises, there are a number of hidden costs like insurance fees, licenses, and the price of child-proofing your home or rented space.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Become a words wizard. You can start offering freelance copy writing, editing or proofreading services with very little costs involved. More specialized paths include medical transcription, translation or transcribing services. While most of this work does not require formal training, often times some form of certification can give you a leg up on the competition. If you are detail oriented, willing to research and love words, this could be the perfect fit.</p> \n\n<p>Act as a computer consultant. Tinkering with your home computer can turn into a lucrative career. For experts, there are a number of business paths available, including computer repair, software training and data entry. Since technology is everywhere, you have many potential clients. You can offer your services to home users, other small businesses or even larger organizations. A computer consulting business also means you can control your own hours.</p> \n\n<p>Take care of pets. Tending to pets&amp;#160;is arguably&amp;#160;the cutest small business you could start.&amp;#160;Pet-owners are willing to pay top dollar for their pets. You can provide a variety of pet-related services, such as dog training and walking, grooming or pet sitting. Experience with animals is usually a prerequisite for starting these businesses, especially when it comes to dog training and grooming. If you don&#8217;t know how to cut a dog&#8217;s nails, you probably don&#8217;t want to try.</p>", "title": "Best Small Businesses for Beginners", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2011/11/28/best-small-businesses-for-beginners.html", "published_at": "2016-03-23", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Shares of Northern Dynasty Minerals (NYSEMKT: NAK) were on the move once more in Wednesday trading, closing the day up 16.7%.</p> \n\n<p>The question is: Why?

Having a political opinion can both help and hurt a brand. Those who agree with a company's opinion might shop there more, while people who feel the other way will vote with their wallets as well.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) and its CEO, Howard Schultz, has never been a brand to stay on the sidelines. That makes its not at all surprising that the global coffee giant has taken an aggressive stand against Trump's efforts to ban people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States, including refugees fleeing wars.</p> \n\n<p>In the immediate aftermath of the Trump administration's efforts, Schultz sent a <a href=\"https://news.starbucks.com/news/living-our-values-in-uncertain-times\" type=\"external\">letter Opens a New Window.</a> to his employees laying out what the company plans to do and saying he hears \"the alarm you all are sounding that the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack.\"</p> \n\n<p>The company's efforts include working to support the company's employees in or from affected countries. Most notably, Schultz took a direct shot at the president, pledging to hire 10,000 refugees at its stores around the world and in the United States over five years.</p> \n\n<p>Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz says his company plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years. Image source: Starbucks.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>\"We have a long history of hiring young people looking for opportunities and a pathway to a new life around the world,\" wrote Schultz. \"This is why we are doubling down on this commitment by working with our equity market employees as well as joint venture and licensed market partners in a concerted effort to welcome and seek opportunities for those fleeing war, violence, persecution and discrimination.\"</p> \n\n<p>The CEO noted that there are more than 65 million \"citizens of the world\" recognized as refugees by the United Nations, and said that Starbucks plans to hire 10,000 of them over five years in the 75 countries where the chain does business. Schultz said those efforts will start in the U.S., where the company will focus on hiring \"those individuals who have served with U.S. troops as interpreters and support personnel in the various countries where our military has asked for such support.\"</p> \n\n<p>This is not the first time the company has targeted a specific group to fill jobs. The chain has hired 8,000 veterans and military spouses -- nearing its stated goal of hiring 10,000 by 2018. It has also worked with Opportunity Youth to hire \"10,000 young men and women who are not in school and not employed,\" according to the company's 2016 annual shareholder's letter.</p> \n\n<p>Starbucks closed 2016 with 25,734 stores and plans to add 2,100 more in 2017. Given the company's aggressive plans to expand in China as well as its stated goal of opening 1,000 Reserve stores, it's reasonable to expect it to open around 10,000 (or more) stores over the five-year period it has pledged to hire 10,0000 refugees.</p> \n\n<p>Even if that number comes in lower -- at, say, 8,000 new locations over five years -- that would give the company 33,734 locations across the world. As long as it hires one refugee for every third store, it should hit its target. It's also worth noting that Starbucks does not report how many employees it has (since some work for franchisees and not company-owned stores) but the number came in at 238,000, according to to <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/companies/starbucks/\" type=\"external\">Forbes Opens a New Window.</a> as of May 2016. That would mean this move -- while politically significant -- represents only a little over 4% of its current global workforce.</p> \n\n<p>For Starbucks, it's not really about numbers, it's about drawing a line in the sand. The company has always been socially conscious -- efforts Schultz plans to continue to lead after handing over the CEO job to COO Kevin Johnson later this year -- and making this announcement shows that the chain has decided to double down on that stand even if it might cause it some short-term harm (or put it at odds with the American president).</p> \n\n<p>It's a bold political move that will win the company fans from people who oppose the president's actions while losing it some business from those who don't. It's hard to know if that will be a net positive or a net negative.</p> \n\n<p>The company has thrived despite sometimes finding itself at odds with right-leaning customers (like its various Christmas cup \"scandals\" over the years). It's likely that making this decision will ultimately help a lot of refugees and their families while tightening the chain's relationship with its core customers who respect its values. It's a political risk, but it's the type of move the chain has made throughout its history without suffering long-term ill effects.</p> \n\n<p>Find out why Starbucks is one of the 10 best stocks to buy now</p> \n\n<p>Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner have spent more than a decade beating the market.

On New York&#8217;s Power 105.1FM morning show, &#8220;The Breakfast Club,&#8221; the&amp;#160;hosts discussed the video and upcoming event exposing the widespread ignorance of the general American public&amp;#160;towards female sexuality and rape.</p> \n\n<p>Angela Yee, the shows only female participant, attempted to highlight the purpose of Rose&#8217;s efforts saying, &#8220;Amber Rose is doing this Slut Walk and the whole point of it is against slut shaming.&#8221; Within moments, her two male co-hosts piped up with these responses: &#8220;So basically they want to be able to be sluts and hoes but they don&#8217;t want anybody to call them that&#8221; and &#8220;Sounds like they want to promote being sluts and hoes.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The exasperation in Angela&#8217;s voice was impossible to miss as she continued to try to educate the pair&amp;#160;about&amp;#160;importance of the event, which mobilizes supporters against rape, sexual injustice, victim-blaming and gender inequality. Most of her very valid insights were met with ignorance by her male cohorts, Charlamagne The God and DJ Envy, who managed to overpower the message of female empowerment by reinforcing the same old stereotypical tropes which Slut Walk attempts to dispel.</p> \n\n<p>The entire interaction provides a glimpse into the world of gender politics, revealing the tactics/arguments often employed by men to derail conversations about female empowerment and sexual equality. So, I&#8217;ve taken the time to respond to the most ignorant (and common) arguments put forth by both the show&#8217;s male hosts, its callers and some of the&amp;#160;commenters who left opinions on Amber Rose&#8217;s Funny&amp;#160;or Die PSA, in an attempt to get this conversation back on track.</p> \n\n<p>1. &#8220;You can&#8217;t empower certain things like slut and hoe behavior.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>DJ Envy. Like, serious? What, precisely, is this then?</p> \n\n<p>In any case, to further my point, let&#8217;s remove the derogatory labels from this sentence and restate it to demonstrate the problem with the logic: &#8220;You can&#8217;t empower certain things like sexual autonomy or sexual freedom.&#8221;&amp;#160;So we shouldn&#8217;t empower a woman&#8217;s freedom to express her sexuality? I beg to differ. It seems that DJ Envy does also, considering the fact that he has empowered many strippers who freely parade their sexuality by making it rain his hard-earned cash &#8212; $20,000 of it allegedly? &#8212; on the stage where they perform.</p> \n\n<p>2. &#8220;So basically they want to be able to be sluts and hoes but they don&#8217;t want anybody to call them that.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The definition of the word slut reads: &#8220;a woman who has many casual sexual partners&#8221; or &#8220;a sexually promiscuous woman.&#8221; Though there is nothing inherently wrong with having many casual sex partners &#8212; hence the reason why we applaud men for participating in such behavior &#8212; there is no equivalent slur hurled at men who are promiscuous, revealing the underlying problem with the term: the word &#8220;slut&#8221; is sexist. It degrades a woman simply because she chooses to freely express her sexuality. Thus a woman does not want to be called a &#8220;slut&#8221; in the degrading, derogatory manner in which it&#8217;s typically used to diminish her value based on her right to sexual autonomy and freedom. That same woman , however, still may feel that she has the right to freely engage in any sexual acts she chooses, because she is an adult and what she decides to do with her pussy is her problem.</p> \n\n<p>3. &amp;#160;&#8220;You can&#8217;t have an actual slut [Amber Rose] hold a Slut Walk.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>A woman who has been branded and labeled because of her style&amp;#160;of dress or participation in the sex industry and who has somehow managed to find success, is actually the perfect person to host a Slut Walk, because said branding represents the inequality which Slut Walks protest against.</p> \n\n<p>This is not at all the first time that Charlamagne The God has shown such disrespect to women.</p> \n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a recap of a recent&amp;#160;conversation Charlamagne The God&amp;#160;had with rapper&amp;#160;Master P <a href=\"http://madamenoire.com/507437/master-p-checks-charlemagne-for-disrespecting-women/\" type=\"external\">about respecting women</a>:</p> \n\n<p>Charlemagne: I always wondered, how did you set up promotion for your projects? Because it was a time that No Limit was dropping project every week. It was a No Limit product in stores every week. Except for Mercedes, we never saw that. And I always wanted to see that because she had a fat ass pussy.</p> \n\n<p>Master P: See there bruh, hold up&#8230; Don&#8217;t talk about Mercedes like that.</p> \n\n<p>Charlemagne: Oh, my bad. I didn&#8217;t know. Is she family or something?</p> \n\n<p>Master P: She ain&#8217;t family; but still though, with all my people man, you know how I am. But we good, man. You know what I&#8217;m saying&#8230;you know how we get down.</p> \n\n<p>Charlemagne: But how were you setting it up, promotion wise?</p> \n\n<p>Master P: Naw, let&#8217;s go back to this dog. Let&#8217;s respect. Because I&#8217;m not going to talk about your sister, your mom or nothing. That&#8217;s the first thing. I know you do your radio thing and I respect that; but at the same time, Mercedes is a&#8230;she a female.</p> \n\n<p>Charlemagne: You right. My bad. But she did look good on that cover though.</p> \n\n<p>Master P: She did look good. That&#8217;s your opinion&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Master P: But like I said man, it&#8217;s about respect, Charlemagne. You know me and you go back.</p> \n\n<p>Charlemagne: Absolutely.</p> \n\n<p>Master P: When we talk about women&#8211; I don&#8217;t care I ain&#8217;t gon&#8217; disrespect no hookers or nothing. Cuz I don&#8217;t do that, I&#8217;m a man. And I don&#8217;t want nobody to disrespect no people that I know. You know what I&#8217;m saying.</p> \n\n<p>Charlemagne: Absolutely.</p> \n\n<p>When Master P has more respect for women than most men in society do, you know there&#8217;s a problem. And even after being schooled by Master P on not disrespecting or mislabeling women or referring to them in a derogatory manner, Charlamagne The God &#8212; like many men &#8212; still continues to do so, further proving the need for the movement in the first place.</p> \n\n<p>4. &#8220;Sounds like they want to promote being sluts and hoes.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>A simple Google search of the term &#8220;Slut Walk&#8221; can enlighten any individual to the goals of the nationwide events and its participants. Chief among them: protest against victim-blaming in rape and sexual assault cases; call for an end to rape culture and sexual injustice; and end derogatory labeling. The words &#8220;sluts&#8221; and &#8220;hoes&#8221; falls right into the latter category.</p> \n\n<p>5. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want my daughter to go to one of these things.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>You would not want you daughter to be surrounded by strong women who are rallying to reclaim their autonomy, freedom and sexuality while calling for an end to rape and sexual inequality? I can think of many more dangerous places for daughters &#8212; like college campuses where <a href=\"http://www.oneinfourusa.org/statistics.php\" type=\"external\">one in four college women report surviving rape or attempted rape</a>, at home with a partner, where <a href=\"http://www.safehorizon.org/page/domestic-violence-statistics--facts-52.html\" type=\"external\">one&amp;#160;in four women experience domestic violence in her life time</a>,&amp;#160;or in the military where 25 percent of women have been sexually assaulted and up to 80 percent have been sexually harassed. But it&#8217;s cool if you think a bunch of women&amp;#160;coming together for the sake of their own rights is your daughter&#8217;s number one threat.</p> \n\n<p>6. &#8220;Amber Rose is the face of Slut Walk, which is wrong because she&#8217;s a slut.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Now, I done already explained that calling a woman a slut, while diminishing&amp;#160;a movement against calling women derogatory names makes no damn sense, so I won&#8217;t reiterate that point. Instead, here&#8217;s a brief history lesson about Slut Walk: The movement launched in Toronto, Canada, in 2011 after a police constable said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been told I&#8217;m not supposed to say this &#8211; however, women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized.&#8221; The Slut Walk movement is a rallying cry for women that has gained steam all around the world. Rallies have been seen all over Europe, Asia, Latin America and of course the United States.</p> \n\n<p>So, no, Amber Rose is not the &#8220;face of&#8221; Slut Walk. She is merely an advocate who is participating in a movement that has existed for a few years now.</p> \n\n<p>8. &#8220;I think [Slut Walk] is a bunch of bull crap. It&#8217;s a terrible example for kids.&#8221; A terrible reality for children is one where women and girls are sexualized, objectified, labeled derogatory terms, victim-blamed and face constant inequality and violence. That reality is perpetuated by men who face no consequences for their &#8220;loose&#8221; sexual morals or behavior but continuously attempt to chastise or degrade women for participating in the same exact thing.</p> \n\n<p>This MTV2 video featuring Charlamagne and a friend at a strip club provides a keen example:</p> \n\n<p>The video perfectly demonstrates society&#8217;s male/female double standard. Man goes to strip club and pays for &#8220;adult entertainment&#8221; and he is a positive role model. The women providing the entertainment are &#8220;sluts&#8221; and &#8220;hoes.&#8221; If this is not inequality, then what is?</p>", "title": "Frisky Rant: Male Reactions To Amber Rose\u2019s Support Of Slut Walk Prove Why The Movement Is So Necessary", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://thefrisky.com/2015-09-17/frisky-rant-male-reactions-to-amber-roses-support-of-slut-walk-prove-why-the-movement-is-so-necessary/?utm_source%3Dsc-fb%26utm_medium%3Dref%26utm_campaign%3Damber-rose", "published_at": "2018-10-03", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>A North Dakota farmer wanted to send the NFL a message on kneeling during the national anthem &#8212; so he grabbed his tractor and went to work.</p> \n\n<p>Gene Hanson, 77, owns an 850-acre farm in Edgeley, North Dakota, where he decided to use his tractor to write a massive message stretching the length of two-football fields: &#8220;We Stand For The National Anthem.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I go with Trump on this one,&#8221; Hanson <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/10/farmer-plows-message-for-nfl-stand-for-national-anthem.html\" type=\"external\">told</a> Fox News this week. &#8220;If you want to protest, that&#8217;s not the place to do it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Hanson, using his &#8220;old&#8221; Massey tractor, wrote the message without using a GPS device to help guide him.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;A lot of people died over our flag,&#8221; Hanson continued. &#8220;We&#8217;re able to voice our opinion because of it.

For 2014, an individual can have up to $5.34 million in his or her gross estate before it is taxed. And yes, IRAs are includible in the gross estate, which leads many people to believe that IRAs are now taxed twice -- once at the beneficiary level and then at the estate level.</p> \n\n<p>However, if you go back to the premise that the income had been tax-deferred all this time, it does start to make some sense.</p> \n\n<p>Please accept my sympathies on the loss of your father and thanks for the great question.</p> \n\n<p>Ask the adviser</p> \n\n<p>To ask a question on Tax Talk, go to the \" <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/brm/ask.asp\" type=\"external\">Ask the Experts Opens a New Window.</a>\" page and select \"Taxes\" as the topic.

Did you happen to see it? I can&#8217;t&#8230; When Obama finds out what happened last night, oh, man! And he may not. If he wasn&#8217;t watching the game, he may not have known. If the intel services don&#8217;t tell him what happened last night, he may never know, and that may end up being good. It could be bad out there, folks. It could really be bad. &#8230; Did you see where the safety for the Kansas City Chiefs intercepted Tom Brady last night? A pick six.</p> \n\n<p>A gentleman by the name of Husain Abdullah, not to be confused with the king of Saudi Arabia, whose name is King Abdullah bin Abdilaziz. This is Husain Abdullah of the Kansas City Chiefs, not the king of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah bin Abdilaziz. What happened was that Husain Abdullah intercepted Mr. Brady and returned the pick to the end zone for a touchdown for the Chiefs, and immediately Mr. Husain Abdullah slid through the end zone and then bowed with his helmeted head on the Arrowhead Stadium turf and prayed.</p> \n\n<p>Immediately, he was flagged. The Chiefs, his team, were penalized 15 yards for what is called unsportsmanlike conduct. Now, the NFL&#8217;s already in trouble, big-time trouble, with all of the domestic abuse and spousal abuse. Wait till Obama hears about this &#8212; IF he hears about this. The odds are, Obama is unlikely to hear about any of these things unless he was watching the game. We find out that Obama doesn&#8217;t even attend 60% of his daily intelligence briefings.</p> \n\n<p>Remember we were told by somebody, some White House spokesman, I forget the term, but we were told that Obama is, well, ingrained in intelligence. I mean, he is so in tune with intelligence, he doesn&#8217;t need the daily briefs. He knows what he&#8217;s gonna be told before they walk into the room. As such, he doesn&#8217;t have to waste his time. So the presidential daily brief is presented to him in writing. It is unknown whether he readies them, however.</p> \n\n<p>The thing that has everybody talking today is how Obama totally blamed his intel community for not telling him what was really up to ISIS, and yet people have gone back and found out that the intelligence community knew everything there was to know about ISIS and has been trying to tell Obama about it since 2012. It didn&#8217;t matter. He still threw Clapper and everybody else in his intelligence services under the bus, in the Sunday night 60 Minutes interview.</p> \n\n<p>Oh, that&#8217;s another thing. <a href=\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2014/09/media-ignores-obamas-60-minutes-ratings-collapse-down-69-in-a-week/\" type=\"external\">Did you see the ratings for 60 Minutes on Sunday night</a>\" Tank, folks. Toilet City. Nowhere. Some of the lowest ratings 60 Minutes had in a long time with the Obama interview. Do you know what the excuse is\" &#8220;There was no football lead-in. CBS didn&#8217;t have a late game so there was no football lead-in.&#8221; Nobody&#8217;s saying that people tuned out offing 60 Minutes &#8217;cause Obama was on, but that&#8217;s what happened. I mean, it was well known.</p> \n\n<p>CBS promoed all over the place that Steve Kroft was gonna be slow pitching softball pitching questions to Obama. So if you&#8217;re an Obama fan, it&#8217;s an ideal time to watch. But they didn&#8217;t. The ratings were really. And nobody is talking&#8230; Well, some people are talking about the trade publications out here, like variety and Hollywood Reporter and Dateline and all, they&#8217;re all reporting 60 Minutes&#8217; horrible ratings performance Sunday night, but none of them (chuckling) are even mentioning that Obama was on.</p> \n\n<p>They&#8217;re all just chalking it up to the fact that it was&#8230; &#8220;Ah, it was just too bad. There wasn&#8217;t any NFL game on CBS to give them a great lead-in,&#8221; which means that 60 Minutes started on time, and it never does start on time in the football season. It always runs late because of the football game, but there wasn&#8217;t one. So, anyway, what do you think is more likely Obama will condemn: The NFL throwing a flag on a Muslim for pray..</p> \n\n<p>By the way, the NFL said the flag was a mistake; he should not have been penalized. There is no rule in the book that says you can&#8217;t pray or genuflect after a touchdown. They let Tebow do it. You know, Christians get down on one knee or give the sign of the cross and look to the heavens and thank God for the touchdown. But Husain Abdullah (again, not to be confused with Abdullah bin Abdilaziz of</p> \n\n<p>Saudi Arabia) actually got down on all fours and then lowered his head to the turf at Arrowhead Stadium.</p> \n\n<p>I must say, the turf looked good last night. I watched the first half. It looked really, really good. Hadn&#8217;t looked that good since George Toma was doing it. I like the chiefs in total fire engine red last night. How about the Patriots? You know, Tom Brady has not had the best season, but it&#8217;s over now. (laughing) The sports media is just all over him. &#8220;He&#8217;s gone, he&#8217;s finished, throw him away, bring in the substitute, let&#8217;s start the new Patriots era with the new quarterback.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s amazing how fast the media chews people up and spits them out.</p> \n\n<p>BREAK TRANSCRIPT</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: No, no, I don&#8217;t keep any grief for talking about football opening the program. This is a relevant societal, cultural issue that&#8217;s taking place here, and the NFL was quick&#8230; Oh. I should have added, the NFL was quick today to throw the referees last night overboard, should not have been a penalty on Mr. Husain Abdullah.</p> \n\n<p>It should not have happened, it was a huge gaffe, it was a big mistake.</p> \n\n<p>They made sure that the world heard about that.</p> \n\n<p>BREAK TRANSCRIPT</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: We start on the phones today in</p> \n\n<p>Michigan. China, Michigan. This is James. Welcome, sir. Great to have you here.</p> \n\n<p>CALLER: Good afternoon, Rush. Twenty-plus years of dittos.</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: Thank you very much. I sincerely appreciate that.</p> \n\n<p>CALLER: I have a silly question. Wasn&#8217;t George W. Bush criticized for only getting his daily briefings and not reading the news itself? And, two, how do the Washington Redskins get picked on but Kansas City Chiefs get a pass?</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: Well, let&#8217;s take the first question first. I&#8217;m not&#8230; You know, I have a vague memory of Bush and the presidential daily brief. There was news in the presidential daily brief about 9/11 or allusions to the possibility, not the specificity of it. I don&#8217;t remember specifically if Bush was tarred and feathered for not reading beyond the daily brief. I know he was laughed at when he admitted he didn&#8217;t read newspapers, the Washington Post, New York Times. He was chastised for that.</p> \n\n<p>But I don&#8217;t&#8230; I&#8217;m gonna have to search my memory banks, the deep, dark crevices of my memory banks to find out what it was that Bush was ripped for in the presidential daily brief. Now, when it comes to the Redskins and the Chiefs, give &#8217;em time. Give &#8217;em time. Once they get the Redskins name changed, it will be on to others. That will fuel them. Right now, if you had to compare the names Redskins to Chiefs, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d have a whole lot of people saying that the Chiefs is offensive.</p> \n\n<p>Not yet. It could happen down the road, because the Chiefs are the leaders. The Chiefs, they run the show. That&#8217;s power. Redskins is considered to be a derogatory term. But it&#8217;s not even about that. This whole Redskins thing is just another media-manufactured thing made to look like a groundswell of opinion supports it when it doesn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s classic.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s part of the daily media soap opera, and the left is gonna keep pounding it until people get so fed up with it that they&#8217;re gonna say, &#8220;Just change it! We&#8217;re tired of hearing about it. We don&#8217;t care. Just change it! Stop!&#8221; And that&#8217;s generally how the left gets what they want. They intimidate, they bully, and they never go away until people just throw up their hands. It&#8217;s like the way we deal with serious crime. Moynihan said: Define deviancy down. You finally figure out you can&#8217;t stop certain kind of crimes so you stop calling them serious. You just accept it. You call it the new norm or what have you.</p>", "title": "Wait Till Obama Finds Out About What Happened in the Chiefs-Patriots Game", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2014/09/30/wait_till_obama_finds_out_about_what_happened_in_the_chiefs_patriots_game", "published_at": "2014-09-30", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Hulu</a> LLC will begin streaming TV shows from Spanish-language broadcaster <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Univision Communications</a> Inc. later this year, the companies said Wednesday.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>The deal will give video site Hulu its first big cache of Spanish-language content from the company whose eponymous channel is the most watched Spanish-language TV outlet in the US.</p> \n\n<p>The new offering will include access to new and old telenovelas, variety shows and reality series from Univision's TV networks, which include sister channels Telefutura and cable channel Galavision.</p> \n\n<p>Only a \"selection\" of Univision's new programming will be available for free on Hulu the day after the shows air on Univision networks.

He has been following the debate surrounding this fence with curiosity, and some amusement. So, he asks, &#8220;what should we call it? A fence or a wall?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The Washington Post had a long story last weekend about American and Mexican communities along the Texas border. These communities will be influenced by the new fence &#8211; if it is built &#8211; and by any force trying to interrupt the daily flow of people and goods from one side of the border to the other. It&#8217;s a story reminiscent of the one of Palestinian workers and commuters and farmers finding it difficult to adjust to the reality of an actual, not imaginary, border.</p> \n\n<p>Two weeks ago, I attended a panel discussion during which a New York Times editor explained why the paper chose &#8220;barrier&#8221; as the word to best describe the Israeli fence and wall along the West Bank. The word&#8217;s not perfect, but it&#8217;s somewhat more neutral. The anonymous Israeli expert is eagerly waiting to see what kind of barrier the Americans will be building. And he is more than ready to offer some advice (free of charge, but also of commitment). And he is not the first or only one to do so. American officials, and even more so, politicians, sought some advice from Israel on this matter in the past - and according to some knowledgeable people, are expected to do so even more in the near future. Former California Governor Pete Wilson cited the Israeli fence as a model for the U.S. in an article he wrote for the Investor&#8217;s Business Daily. So here is some of what our Israeli expert has to say about it:</p> \n\n<p>Money: It will probably cost more than you think. Why? Because that&#8217;s always the way it is with such projects. Americans, the Israeli says, tend to be very structured in their work, in a way that has many benefits but also some limitations. It means that they waste a lot of money on &#8220;process&#8221; and &#8220;management&#8221; and &#8220;studies&#8221; before they really act. They make no short-cuts, thus save no money. In the last issue of The National Journal, the Israeli fence is mentioned as the example to use when calculating the cost of such a fence (2000 mile fence = $6.4 billion dollars). The Israeli expert thinks the Americans will end up paying more.</p> \n\n<p>Efficiency: It can work, the expert says - and other Israeli know-hows agree. Don&#8217;t buy the argument of liberal opponents who say &#8220;no fence can stop people from coming.&#8221; If done in a proper way, the fence can work. It can achieve whatever goal the U.S. wants it to, &#8220;100 percent, 90 percent, 80 percent prevention. Just make the right commitment and you'll get results.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Tactics: Don&#8217;t just rely on sophisticated machinery and equipment. You need people on the ground using the equipment to pursue the invaders. They need to react fast, they need intelligence, and they need to be tireless. It will only take a couple of months before the flow of immigrants will become much weaker.</p> \n\n<p>Intelligence: Recruit people on the Mexican side to be your eyes and ears and to tell you what the smugglers are up to. Make sure you can communicate fast, and react even faster. Good intelligence can be the key factor for success.</p> \n\n<p>Routine: The smugglers will be inventive and will look for ways around you. If you stick to some regulated routine, you&#8217;ll end up wasting your time and your money. Surprise them where they don&#8217;t expect you, make them understand that no place is safe, no route out of reach. &#8220;Don&#8217;t police them, fight them.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Ruthlessness: Is it really important for the Americans? If it is, they should be prepared to show it. &#8220;Make the other side understand that this is no game &#8211; that life can be in danger,&#8221; says the expert. &#8220;I know this is the toughest advice of all, but short of doing it the Americans will end up pretending to stop illegal immigrants rather than really doing it. At the end of the day, it is very simple: America is more powerful than the smugglers &#8211; meaning, it can deter them from doing what they do.&#8221; But there&#8217;s one condition necessary to keep this preponderance of power working: &#8220;It should be as important for America to stop the illegal new comers as it is for them to come.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Danger: You mean they have to shoot the smugglers? &#8220;No, they have to stop them. But if they run away they have to chase them, and if they resist they need to use force. Eventually, they&#8217;ll end up doing things you don&#8217;t want people to watch on television. I&#8217;m not sure if they have the resolve and the stomach to do it. Maybe it&#8217;s not as important for them as they claim it is.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Conduct: Corruption can be a serious problem on the sealed border. As it gets tougher to enter the U.S, people will be ready to pay a high price for it, and the temptation to help those people in something one shouldn&#8217;t underestimate. Take it into account while devising the system.</p> \n\n<p>SHMUEL ROSNER writes for Ha&#8217;aretz.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "Israeli Advice on Wall-Building", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2006/05/24/israeli-advice-on-wall-building/", "published_at": "2006-05-24", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>The PTS (Partido de Trabajadores Socialistas) from Argentina expresses its solidarity with the four postal workers of the Paris Arrondissement 92 who were arrested on May 21st.

The two big stories are (1) that the Democrats on the Committee are politicizing its work (by calling for a broader investigation than the Republican leadership desires), and (2) that the Committee has received a blockbuster report from the Defense Department documenting ties between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda. The latter story hails from the neocon rag, The Weekly Standard, which has promoted the Iraq War every step of the way and bewails the fact that Donald Rumsfeld is unwilling to deploy more troops to insure the U.S. gets the job done in the occupied nation. The Standard and Fox News are of course both owned by Rupert Murdoch, whose fair and balanced view of the world is well known.</p> \n\n<p>These stories draw attention to the fact that the Senate Intelligence Committee plays a key role in the ongoing discussion, within the ruling elite, of how to deal with the obvious quagmire that is Iraq. The American people have increasingly come to see the war as a mistake, or something not worth the human and financial costs; too few yet understand the war as a crime, predicated on lies and the conscious exploitation of 9-11 by unprincipled warmongers with an agenda. But that understanding may come, and neither the Standard nor Fox News wants it to happen. Presently, they see Democratic presidential candidates, for their own political purposes (let us not assume any higher, morally-grounded ones) driving home the fact that Iraq did not constitute an urgent threat to the U.S., and had nothing to do with 9-11. In response, Fox insists on the Bushites&#8217; view of reality, with increasingly ferocious determination as that view becomes discredited. Having erased even the traditional bourgeois journalistic distinction between &#8220;news&#8221; and &#8220;commentary,&#8221; Fox exists to bludgeon even timid anti-imperialist voices, whether they emanate from the right or left.</p> \n\n<p>The Rockefeller Memo</p> \n\n<p>Fox rages against Senator Jay Rockefeller, ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, and his staff for politicizing the Committee&#8217;s work. What, specifically, does this mean? It seems that Rockefeller has insisted that the Committee scrutinize not only the CIA&#8217;s collection of information, but that amassed (or generated) by the Office of Special Plans. The committee&#8217;s chair, Kansas Republican Pat Roberts, opposes this, insists that the committee&#8217;s work is &#8220;90 to 95&#8221; percent finished, and has already concluded that <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">any intelligence failures are attributable to the CIA</a>. (This has become the conventional wisdom articulated in the corporate press. Newsweek&#8217;s cover story says it all: &#8220;How Dick Cheney Sold the War. The Inside Story: Why He Fell for Bad Intelligence&#8212;And Preached It to the President.&#8221; The V-P fell for bad intelligence. Now the question is: Does one blame the CIA, which actually resisted pressure to doctor and cherry-pick intelligence to justify the attack on Iraq, or the Office of Special Plans, which did not so much mislead Cheney as assist him in manufacturing a casus belli for a conflict he was eager to fight whatever the legitimately collected intelligence might say?</p> \n\n<p>Now, very few Americans have ever heard of the Office of Special Plans, and Fox no doubt wants to keep it that way. This was the office created last spring, after the CIA and DIA kept telling Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and his deputy Paul Wolfowitz that they just couldn&#8217;t come up with any links between 9-11 and Saddam Hussein. Created in Spring 2002 and peopled by former Congressional staffers (rather than intelligence operatives), it was charged with &#8220;thinking outside the box&#8221; and rethinking information rejected by intelligence professionals in order to make a case for war. Its business was what Greg Thielmann, former proliferation expert in the State Department&#8217;s Bureau of Intelligence and Research and now a principled critic of Bushite disinformation, called &#8220;faith-based intelligence.&#8221; It was headed by Straussian neocons William Luti and Abe Shulsky, who are on record as advocating the use of noble lies to create public opinion that serves the policy agendas of the warmongering Wise.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear whether the super-secret office, which reported to ultra-hawk, Likudist, neocon Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas J. Feith, is still operative. But I think it quite likely that some version of it lingers in the bowels of the Defense Department, assigned new chores in accordance with the New American Century program that Feith helped author. Over here, you have a team assigned to produce a &#8220;finding&#8221; about Syrian weapons of mass destruction threatening the American homeland; over there, a former Congressional staffer asked to prove Syrian intimacy with bin Laden and al-Qaeda. At an adjoining desk, someone investigating Syria&#8217;s receipt of WMDs as gifts from Saddam Hussein; others handle state-run Syrian banks&#8217; financial services to Iraq and to international terrorism, Syrian government coordination of &#8220;foreign terrorists&#8217; infiltration&#8221; into Iraq through the unpoliceable 400-mile desert border. Over there, people on top of containing the damage caused by statements that emanate from different agencies and branches in government which for their own reasons aren&#8217;t on board the program, and keep denying the disinformation. And so on. That&#8217;s how the neocons operate.</p> \n\n<p>Senator Rockefeller is apparently uncomfortable with this sort of deviousness. Perhaps he feels some empathy with the CIA, whose personnel are in a bind. They understand the need for psy-ops and lies, and for people sometimes taking responsibility for things that they have in fact no relation to. Thus when the Niger uranium lie came to light, George J. Tenet, as CIA head, &#8220;fell on his sword&#8221; as the media repeatedly put it (although the Roman martial allusion wasn&#8217;t really apt) and assumed responsibility. But the lie didn&#8217;t originate with the CIA. It was straight out of Special Plans. Now Bush loyalist Senator Roberts, guiding the Intelligence Committee, wants again to pin any errors or exaggerations pertinent to the administration&#8217;s pre-war accusations about Iraqi WMDs on the conventional intelligence agencies, and Rockefeller&#8217;s saying: <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">We need to check out Special Plans.</a> Rockefeller&#8217;s office sent a memo to Democrats noting Roberts&#8217; defensiveness, suggesting ways to counter it, noting that Roberts sought to confine attention to the venerable Agency. Fox&#8217;s Sean Hannity somehow got a copy and was on Rockefeller&#8217;s case immediately. The Feith Memo</p> \n\n<p>How political! accused patriotic Sean. How dare Rockefeller try to politicize the issue of the official rationale for war with Iraq? To investigate the possibility that what everyone with a brain now understands to have been, at minimum, &#8220;flawed&#8221; or &#8220;hyped&#8221; intelligence, might actually have been deliberate disinformation&#8212;-now, that&#8217;s an a politicizing type of inquiry. Shame on Rockefeller! Praise be, meanwhile, unto Office of Special Plans boss Douglas Feith, author of yet another &#8220;leaked&#8221; memo falling into the hands of Fox News anchors via the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Weekly Standard</a>.</p> \n\n<p>This memo, sent to the Senate Intelligence Committee October 27, contains a &#8220;classified annex&#8221; that &#8220;proves&#8221; (to the Standard&#8217;s and Fox&#8217;s low standards) the putative Saddam-Osama link. Fox does not suggest that <a href=\"http://www.antiwar.com/comment/feith1.html\" type=\"external\">this memo</a> and its leakage politicize discussion of the war, or that there&#8217;s anything untoward about their own use of this &#8220;news.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The Weekly Standard tendentiously titles its screed &#8220;Case Closed,&#8221; as if to demand an end to the discussion. Alas for the neocons and their noble lies, a Washington Post piece by Walter Pincus November 18 cast doubt on the leaked memo&#8217;s blockbuster annex:</p> \n\n<p>W. Patrick Lang, former head of the Middle East section of the DIA, said yesterday that the Standard article &#8220;is a listing of a mass of unconfirmed reports, many of which themselves indicate that the two groups continued to try to establish some sort of relationship. If they had such a productive relationship, why did they have to keep trying?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Another former senior intelligence official said the memo is not an intelligence product but rather &#8220;data points . . . among the millions of holdings of the intelligence agencies, many of which are simply not thought likely to be true.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The Defense Department itself, interestingly enough, <a href=\"http://www.defenselink.mil/\" type=\"external\">issued a statement</a> declaring that the annex to Feith&#8217;s memo outlining &#8220;the relationship between Iraq and al Qaida&#8221; in fact &#8220;drew no conclusions.&#8221; The statement concludes: &#8220;Individuals who leak or purport to leak classified information are doing serious harm to national security; such activity is deplorable and may be illegal.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>So Fox has both trashed an apparently honest effort to expose government deceit paving the way for a bloody imperialist war; and also promoted distorted &#8220;intelligence&#8221; information (in typical neocon fashion) to desperately justify that disaster. The crudity of its effort obliged the Defense Department itself to step in and clarify.

In 1995, Downing wrote an evaluation report describing the s evere social and environmental impacts likely to be suffered by Chile&#8217;s Pehuenche Indians from a proposed dam project underwritten by the World Bank. After his report was censored Downing demanded that the World Bank publicly disclose his findings. The Bank responded by threatening &#8220;a lawsuit garnering Downing&#8217;s assets, income and future salary if he disclosed the contents, findings and recommendations of his independent evaluation.&#8221; (Johnson and Garcia Downing). As a result of his whistleblowing, Downing was blacklisted from the World Bank after 13 years of consulting service.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Personally, I was blackballed for 10 years for filing, what turned out to be 3 human rights violations charges against the IFC (private sector arm of The World Bank),&#8221; said Downing in an interview. &#8220;The experience left me only the devil&#8217;s alternative, to get involved in politics.&#8221; Literally.</p> \n\n<p>Downing went on to serve two terms in the Arizona legislature from 2003-2006. He rejected corporate contributions and collected hundreds of $5 contributions to qualify for public campaign financing. Downing introduced bills to protect the integrity of the election system, co-authoring a bill requiring hand count audits of electronic voting machines. He increased financial support for university and community college students, protected animal rights, improved energy efficiency and more. Eighty-six of Ted&#8217;s co-sponsored bills became law, a spectacular achievment for a Democrat in a Republican controlled legislature.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; or &#8220;Yes, but,&#8221; or. . . .just &#8220;No!&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Many Ph.D.s never find solid employment in the academic world in this age of university downsizing and so offer their wares as evaluators, consultants or &#8220;applied anthropologists&#8221; to non-profits or the corporate world. A good many aim to foster social change but are unprepared for how best to do it. This is especially true for my field, anthropology which at this point in time has more Ph.D.s working in applied fields than the university.</p> \n\n<p>Some years back Harvard anthropologist Kris Heggenhougen argued that the strength of anthropology in collaborating with other disciplines lies in saying, &#8220;yes, but. . .and to critically examine the decisive factors affecting peoples&#8217; health including power, dominance and exploitation.&#8221; (Heggenhougen 1993)</p> \n\n<p>Yes, but. . . . while that sounds good, more needs to be said.</p> \n\n<p>First of all, we spend much more time saying &#8220;yes, sir&#8221; than &#8220;yes, but&#8221; in paid employment. This is necessary if we wish to stay employed. The workplace is a not a democracy but a hierarchy in which academic freedom does not apply. As Downing evinces, there are penalties for speaking one&#8217;s mind. Workers have to gauge the cultural politics in any given context so as to not unnecessarily risk censure, reprimand or worse.</p> \n\n<p>Sometimes, like Downing, they must be prepared to simply say no sir and go with the consequences. Sometimes getting fired leads to new paths that can result in greater accomplishments. Much of it has to do with the right attitude.</p> \n\n<p>Dr. Downing has the right attitude. He retains that probing, cantankerous spirit today. &#8220;I have no idea what &#8216;yes, but&#8217; means having not read Heggenhougen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The reference to &#8216;collaboration to other disciplines&#8217; makes no sense to me &#8211; as I work on problems and am Undisciplined. I don&#8217;t think anyone would consider me a &#8220;yes man &#8211; which has helped and cursed me . . . . .But, I insist, fighting within a bureaucracy is part of being a good applied anything.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In Downing&#8217;s anthropological journey, when &#8220;yes, but&#8221; didn&#8217;t work, he progressed, reluctantly, to &#8220;no, sir.&#8221; In fact this happens to many applied anthropologists but most do not have the resources, support or disciplinary guidance to assist them in their struggles. They might become whistleblowers but their careers suffer. And their stories are untold. We do not have a good accounting of how often this happens to anthropologists, but we need to learn more about this. In any case, resisting censorship is, as Downing says, &#8220;good applied&#8221; anthropology.</p> \n\n<p>Like a Skilled Surgeon</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Good applied&#8221; anthropology harkens back to one of the masters of social science, Robert Lynd. In 1939, Lynd, author of the groun dbreaking Middletown studies (the first full bore ethnography of a U.S. city), wrote a book that is less well known, but just as important. Knowledge for What? The Place of Social Science in American Culture, is as relevant today as the moment he penned it.</p> \n\n<p>In it he wrote that &#8220;[T]he role of the social sciences to be troublesome, to disconcert the habitual arrangements by which we manage to live along, and to demonstrate the possibility of change in more adequate directions . . . like that of a skilled surgeon, [social scientists need to] get us into immediate trouble in order to prevent our present troubles from becoming even more dangerous. In a culture in which power is normally held by the few and used offensively and defensively to bolster their instant adv antage within the status quo, the role of such a constructive troublemaker is scarcely inviting.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Troublemaker&#8221; is of course the pejorative term emanating from within t he dominant culture, targeting those who refuse to keep quiet in the face of injustice. &#8220;Yes but&#8221; is an ample part of their vocabulary. Anthropologist Barbara Johnston has wr itten about the work of being an anthropological troublemaker, especially in relation to doing environmental justice work. But she warns about associated risks. Environmental justice work &#8220;requires confronting, challenging and changing power structures.&#8221; When someone is involved in this work, says Johnston, &#8220;backlash is inevitable.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;When environmental justice work involves advocacy and action &#8211; confrontational politics &#8211; a number of professional bridges are burned. . . .&#8217;Cause-oriented&#8217; anthropology suggests people who make trouble. Troublemakers are celebrated in this discipline when t heir cause succeeds and justice prevails. But often &#8216;justice&#8217; is elusive, success is hard to gauge, and action results in unforeseen adverse consequences. (Johnston: 2001, 8).</p> \n\n<p>Because most anthropologists usually enter organizations as change agent s of some kind they need to be aware that they are especially at risk of being labeled a &#8220;troublemaker&#8221; at any time. If the label sticks it can lead not only to getting fired; it also can lead to a vicious form of bullying that can make one&#8217;s life unbearable.</p> \n\n<p>Beware of the Mobbers</p> \n\n<p>Anthropologist Noa Davenport knows this very well. In 1999 she coauthored a book with two other professionals called, &#8220;Mobbing, Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace, (1999). In the book&#8217;s forward Davenport and her colleagues noted, &#8220;This book came about because all three of us, in different organizations, experienced a workplace phenomenon that had profound effects on our well-being. Through humiliation, harassment, and unjustified accusations, we experienced emotional abuse that forced us out of the workplace.&#8221; Often the mobbing begins soon after the professional challenged a superior in some area. In other words, it&#8217;s often a &#8220;yes , but&#8221; interrogative. Today Davenport conducts workshops on mobbing and counsels people who have experienced such abuse. She turned her private suffering into a public issue and has advanced the culture.</p> \n\n<p>In my research, &#8220;mobbing&#8221; has a great deal of unconscious group behavior associated with it. To understand it one must research the realms of psychoanalysis and group dynamics (Bion 1961, Armstrong et al 2005, Grotstein 2007). Often the abuse had the tacit approval of upper management who themselves are often behind it.</p> \n\n<p>All terrains of employment in capitalist culture operate in a sea of conflict. For a critical applied anthropologist then, one is in dangerous waters from the first day on the job. As Kincheloe and McLaren underscore, critical ethnographers need to critically analyze how larger domains of power, including global and local capital, define one&#8217;s job and inhibit the possibilities of social science practice.</p> \n\n<p>In the applied field, anthropologists are always trying to discern the location of what I call &#8220;the line of unfreedom,&#8221; the place where speaking up may cause reaction. Here&#8217;s a story from a veteran medical anthropologist that illustrates the pressures to conform to the &#8220;yes sir.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve recently been eased off of a multi-million dollar grant that I co-wrote and am (supposed to be) the co-investigator on. My 5 year participation was cut off at year 1 by the Primary Investigator who was getting really nervous about w hat affiliating with me would do to his career. In a nutshell, I wrote a paper that he thought would offend his superiors and so didn&#8217;t want to have any links to me anymore. So he revised the budget and cut me out &#8211; without actually telling me until about 9 months into year 1 &#8211; and only finally because I directly inquired as to where my subcontract for years 2-5 had gotten to. Ultimately he&#8217;s the PI. He was the MD, I was the PhD. He was the insider at the &#8216;very large integrated healthcare system&#8217; where the research is sited, I am not. So yes, he has decision making power &#8211; yes he could do that. Of course, that doesn&#8217;t make it &#8216;right&#8217;, but that&#8217;s how it is. Ironically, the higher ups liked the paper, which was really quite non-threatening.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>What would happen if this applied anthropologist made a work issue over this? He won&#8217;t. From experience he knows that it might not turn out well.</p> \n\n<p>On the Job Which are You First: Employee, Professional, or Citizen?</p> \n\n<p>Indeed, as I tell students in my &#8220;Doing Anthropology&#8221; course, there is an inevitable and permanent tension between three key aspects of &#8220;applied&#8221; work as: 1) an employee, 2) a professional and 3) a citizen. As an employee you sell your labor power to an employer. As a professional anthropologist you seek to abide by the goals, rules and20ethics of your discipline. As a citizen you are most interested in advancing democracy and public education. These subject positions conflict and overlap in numerous ways. But one can be sure that an employer is more interested in your value as an employee than a citizen.</p> \n\n<p>I teach the Ted Downing story as an instructive for students own applied work. Like Downing, applied anthropologists have to be prepared to travel the road from &#8220;yes, but,&#8221; to &#8220;no, sir&#8221; in order to better serve the public interest. Unions are a vital part of this work, as is a keen awareness of how workers are proletarianized. Harry Braverman&#8217;s &#8220;Labor and Monopoly Capital&#8221; is a core text.</p> \n\n<p>David Price continues to catalogue the perils of activist applied anthropologists, demonstrating how, in the 1930s through 1970s, they were subject to surveillance, marginalization and worse for their work. Anthropologist Mich ael Blim, in summarizing the Price book concludes, &#8220;Emerson&#8217;s adage that all it takes for evil to triumph is th at good people do nothing is here confirmed. Based on Price&#8217;s book, one might also add: &#8216;if you try to change your society, trust not your state, your university, or your profession.&#8217;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I am not sure the issue is simply that anthropologists are &#8216;not sufficiently educated about how to protect themselves when challenging authority&#8217; &#8211; as that assumes that historically our anthropological teachers have the means and experience to educate their students,&#8221; said Barbara Johnston. Johnston said that anthropology faculty, in general, do not have the &#8220;seasoned understanding of power and backlash,&#8221; as it occurs in the non-academic world. This is so, she said, because they are still immersed in the &#8220;generic disciplinary reality of the ivory tower cocoon.&#8221; She argues that &#8220; political na&#239;vet&#233; is built into the dependency relationship between the discipline and the university structures that sustain the discipline.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s an uphill battle. As Henry Giroux discusses in his writings, universities are turning into military-academic-industrial complexes where hierarchy is more entrenched and emboldened. Academics need to model &#8220;good applied&#8221; anthropology in their own workplaces (the knowledge factories of higher education) to be more convincing to their students. So how do we better protect ourselves in a harsh work environment?</p> \n\n<p>Downing says, &#8220;Telling the truth is the most important thing &#8211; scientific credibility is critical. I document my reports with hundreds of references pointing directly to documents and footnotes. No embellishment &#8211; extra adverbs or adjectives &#8211; use the words of the documents. Facts, numbers, uncertainties, etc. Good science is your best defense as an activist. If your methodology is approved ahead of20time&#8230;and leads to an unexpected result &#8211; you are on good grounds. Good science gains respect, which becomes a shield&#8230;.but not impermeable. Keep close to the overall organizational objectives of your clien t or organization &#8211; in the case of the World Bank, poverty alleviation.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Downing, who is today a research professor of Social Development at the University of Arizona, said, &#8220;Whistleblowing is a last resort &#8211; since once it is done, your effectiveness as an internal change agent &#8211; moving the organization in the direction that it needs to go &#8211; is finished. I always feel a sense of personal failure when I had to take that last step. It was quite painful. There are other ways t o release information to the outside without blowing the whistle. For example, a freedom of information request or demand for an open meeting may crack opens an issue without the need for self-destruction.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I learned this during my two terms as a State lawmaker. And, above all, maintain a sense of humor on your self-importance. Aw ards are not given and statutes are not erected to whistleblowers!&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I have been booted out of several count ries and organizations,&#8221; said Downing. &#8220;And be assured, the minute a whistle is blown, any weakness in your scientific and professional abilities will be questioned. It is a last resort after you have tried your best to change the organization. I have 3 feet of internal correspondence on the Pangue case going on for over a year before I field my first human rights violation charges against the World Bank (IFC) &#8211; trying to set things right so the Pehuenche Indians would not be harmed.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Still, Barbara Johnston is not optimistic about academic culture&#8217;s abilities to prepare students for the perils of non-academic applied work. In an interview she said that the &#8220;ever-expanding continuum of engagement,&#8221; that is currently underway in anthropology will likely result in more censorship and backlash against applied anthropologists.</p> \n\n<p>Academic Culture Trivializes Activist Work</p> \n\n<p>Johnston points out that academic culture &#8220;trivializes the importance of this work,&#8221; while, at the same time, the engaged anthropologist struggles to find disciplinary support in dealing with backlash, which can range from papers that cannot be=2 0published (and thus cannot advance careers) to disinformation campaigns, character assaults, threats, even murder. She cites the execution of Colombian anthropologist in 1999 after studying displaced persons from a proposed energy development. He was shot by three masked gunmen at a faculty meeting. But the more common forms of retribution and retaliation come in the form of lost jobs, lost careers and lost health.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;While anthropology is a powerful social persona (in Hollywood, public consciousness, legally mandated reviews, etc.) in terms of numbers, it is a very minor discipline. The AAA has only about 11,000 member s compared to the American Economic Association with 21,000, or the American Psychological Association with over 150,000. This means that when it comes to power (who gets the most research grants, who gets to serve as the dominant social science voice in the corridors of power, etc), anthropology is a very minor afterthought.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>And yet there is much room for resistance, she adds.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We have an unusual power because as a social personality anthropology/ists have captured the public imagination. There is a cachet to the title, to the opinions emanating from An Anthropologist.&#8217; So backlash is not only a matter of an unprepared, unforeseen, poorly played hand, but also a matter of threat, and how be st to silence that threat. Anthropology is a very loud mosquito buzzing around the head at night. There is a lot of power there.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Indeed, as Rylko-Bauer and Singer (2006) argue, the historical successes of &#8220;pragmatic engagement&#8221; must be reclaimed for the 21st century. &#8220;For applied anthropologists, the commitment to action is a given; the challenge lies in continuing to find ways of acting more effectively and ethically while linking the specificity of local problem solving to larger sociopolitical contexts.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Yes, but,&#8221; is only one way to act. It&#8217;s often not effective. In response to Heggenhougen&#8217;s challenge, we need to become better prepared to support colleagues who find themselves in circ umstances where, &#8220;no, but,&#8221; is where they must go.</p> \n\n<p>A version of this article was originally published in the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Society for Applied Anthropology Newsletter</a>, Vol. 19:3, Tim Wallace, editor, August 2008</p> \n\n<p>BRIAN McKENNA lives in Michigan.

Despite the company's penchant for secrecy, it's become increasingly clear that Apple has something in the pipeline given that CEO Tim Cook keeps talking about AR's transformative potential. This is that whole \"ship leaking from the top\" bit that Steve Jobs always referred to.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Every few months, Cook weighs in on the debate, either when asked on an earnings conference call or during a media interview. While Cook has never been a product visionary type, even by his own admission, his rationale for why AR has more potential than virtual reality (VR) makes an awful lot of sense, given Apple's never-ending pursuit of technologies that have mainstream appeal.</p> \n\n<p>Tim Cook holding the billionth iPhone. Image source: Apple.</p> \n\n<p>The most recent interview is with <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/apple-tim-cook-boss-brexit-uk-theresa-may-number-10-interview-ustwo-a7574086.html\" type=\"external\">The Independent Opens a New Window.</a>, which was published earlier today. Among other topics, Cook discussed why AR is the way to go.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Perhaps the most off-putting aspect of VR for the average consumer is the fact that users must don a headset to fully immerse themselves into a virtual world. Even before discussing the technical requirements or costs associated with a VR headset, it's fundamentally isolating. In contrast, AR sits on top of the real world as an overlay without the isolation.</p> \n\n<p>Cook continued that he sees the opportunity in AR as analogous to the smartphone, believing that it can be for \"everyone.\" AR still isn't there quite yet, and needs to improve until its \"good enough for the mainstream,\" according to the chief executive.</p> \n\n<p>Cook's comments are but the latest in the ongoing debate over AR's future. In 2016, Cook discussed AR three consecutive months in a row: <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2016/08/13/tim-cook-the-interview-running-apple-is-sort-of-a-lonely-job/\" type=\"external\">The Washington Post Opens a New Window.</a> in August, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/exclusive-apple-ceo-tim-cook-prefers-augmented-reality/story?id=42064913\" type=\"external\">ABC News</a> in September, and <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/johnpaczkowski/apple-ceo-tim-cook-on-virtual-reality-theres-no-substitute-f?utm_term=.wbdja6BOy#.ysJl03dEy\" type=\"external\">BuzzFeed News Opens a New Window.</a> in October. It's obviously been on his mind quite a bit.</p> \n\n<p>At this point, the two most important questions are how Apple will implement it -- a separate AR headset or integrated into the iPhone camera system, or both -- and when Apple will officially release its AR offering. If Apple goes the route of first integrating AR into the iPhone, which would largely be software-based, it could reduce the likelihood of leaks. In contrast, if Apple wants to jump straight to an AR headset, its supply chain will inevitably leak as prototypes are manufactured and there will be more physical evidence of its aspirations.</p> \n\n<p>Hopefully sooner rather than later, Apple will unveil its next \"big idea.\"</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than AppleWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But what the ads really lampoon is what Vanderbilt professor Dana Nelson calls presidentialism: our paternalistic view that presidents are godlike saviors &#8212; and therefore democracy&#8217;s only important figures.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The once-every-four-years hope for the lever pull sensation of democratic power blinds people to the opportunities for democratic representation, deliberation, activism and change that surrounds us in local elections,&#8221; she writes in her new book, &#8220;Bad for Democracy: How the Presidency Undermines the Power of the People.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In a country whose anti-royalist founders constitutionally constrained executive authority, what explains the metastatic growth of presidentialism? The evisceration of journalism and social movements.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The media&#8217;s Watergate triumph sired the current Age of Stenography. With personal glory the new priority, correspondents figured out that transcribing White House prognostication is a far easier way to gain notoriety than Woodward and Bernstein&#8217;s shoe-leather investigations. The result is journalism run by grotesque sloth and vapid speculation &#8212; the kind exemplified by The New York Times&#8217; top three political correspondents this week. As inflation hit crisis levels and the Russia-Georgia conflict inched the planet toward World War III, these &#8220;reporters&#8221; devoted a stunning 2,148 words to fact-free guesses about selections for vice president &#8212; a position with no power and zero impact on ordinary people&#8217;s lives.</p> \n\n<p>Media consolidation and cost-cutting have sped up this decline, turning many local news outlets into collages of wire copy and presidential punditry from D.C. bureaus. Meanwhile, the 21st century&#8217;s most celebrated model of &#8220;grass-roots&#8221; movement-building is MoveOn.org &#8212; a top-down group whose primary function is to land stories about itself in Washington gossip rags and send e-mail spam about presidential candidates.</p> \n\n<p>The resulting noise reiterates one message: The only thing that matters is 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.</p> \n\n<p>Why is this dangerous?

Better yet, how many Democratic enthusiasts donning Obama T-shirts know who their state representative or city council member is &#8212; or even what a state legislature or city council does?</p> \n\n<p>In his upcoming book, &#8220;You Can&#8217;t Be President,&#8221; journalist John MacArthur ponders the depressing answers to these kinds of questions, reminding readers of Alexis de Tocqueville&#8217;s 19th-century writing.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It is in vain to summon a people, which has been rendered so dependent on the central power, to choose from time to time the representatives of that power,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;This rare and brief exercise of their free choice, however important it may be, will not prevent them from gradually losing the faculties of thinking, feeling and acting for themselves, and thus gradually falling below the level of humanity.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Published 168 years ago, the passage is a prescient warning as the upcoming Democratic and Republican conventions toast presidentialism&#8217;s conquest of democracy in America.</p> \n\n<p>David Sirota is a best-selling author whose newest book, &#8220;The Uprising,&#8221; was released in June.

In order to do so with accuracy and clarity, it is first necessary to define addiction and clarify the terms, Christian fundamentalism and Dominionism.</p> \n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/\" type=\"external\">www.dictionary.com</a>, an addiction is &#8220;being abnormally tolerant to and dependent on something that is psychologically or physically habit-forming (especially alcohol or narcotic drugs) [syn: dependence, dependency, 2: an abnormally strong craving 3: (Roman law) under Roman law addiction was the justification for slavery&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>For over seventy years, Twelve-Step programs have addressed issues of addiction not only to substances such as alcohol, drugs, and food, but to behaviors such as compulsive gambling, shopping, and even working. After a number of responses to my last article from former fundamentalist Christians, I began investigating Twelve-Step groups which address issues of religious compulsion and spiritual abuse. One group I discovered was <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/church_of_hank/fundamentalists_anonymous..html\" type=\"external\">Fundamentalists Anonymous</a>(F.A.) and its Twelve Steps.</p> \n\n<p>However, before I examine those steps, I would like to further define the terrorist and tyrannical aspects of Christian fundamentalism.</p> \n\n<p>As many readers drew to my attention in response to my last article, Christian fundamentalism and Dominionism are not necessarily synonymous. According to Merriam-Webster, Christian fundamentalism is: &#8220;a movement in 20th century Protestantism emphasizing the literally interpreted Bible as fundamental to Christian life and teaching b : the beliefs of this movement c : adherence to such beliefs 2 : a movement or attitude stressing strict and literal adherence to a set of basic principles.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yuricareport.com/\" type=\"external\">Katherine Yurica</a>defines Dominionism as &#8220;the conversion of America to a theocracy by taking over the American Judiciary.&#8221; I would add that the conquest might begin with the judiciary, but the Dominonist agenda has targeted all aspects of government and society for the establishment of a theocracy.</p> \n\n<p>For my purposes, the distinction between fundamentalist Christianity and Dominionism is incidental because what is most important to understand is that any religion, philosophy, or belief system can be addictive, fear-based, and terrorizing, and if it is used to justify changing the Constitution of the United States and creating a society in which the laws of that system are also fear-based and terrorizing, then regardless of the label, fundamentalist or Dominionist, that system is both terrorist and tyrannical. Whether one wishes to debate the differences between fundamentalist Christianity and Dominionism or not, both systems are about domination, power, control, right/wrong; win/lose. Moreover, as in my last article, I am reiterating that terrorism and tyranny, like the word addiction, have much broader definitions than crashing planes into buildings, establishing a superior race, or forcing women to cover their faces.</p> \n\n<p>My focus here is on fundamentalist Christianity and Dominionism as religious systems which complement and support tyrannical political systems, specifically, fascism. I am well aware that not all fundamentalist Christians, and certainly not all folks who call themselves evangelicals, are of the Dominionist variety. Many are hard-working individuals who pay their bills and follow the rules and attempt to live the teachings of Jesus. I respect those individuals and consider them a mitigating force amid the onslaughts of the religious right.</p> \n\n<p>For an in-depth analysis of religious right corruption and tyranny, I highly recommend the recent article &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.insider-magazine.com/ChristianMafia.htm\" type=\"external\">The Christian Mafia</a>&#8221; by investigative journalist, Wayne Madsen.</p> \n\n<p>Additionally, my intention in this article is to explore the addictive features of these systems which ultimately result not in spiritual well being but spiritual abuse.</p> \n\n<p>Spiritual abuse is the manipulation, exploitation, and mistreatment&#8211; mentally, emotionally, or physically of another individual or masses of individuals, in the name of promoting spiritual principles or values. As we have seen from the rampant sexual abuse of children in the Roman Catholic Church, spiritual abuse can open the door to every other kind of abuse. And just as a plethora of Catholic priests for two thousand years have used their position of authority and piety to abuse children, countless children in fundamentalist Christian homes have been beaten, raped, molested, shamed, and emotionally devastated in the name of &#8220;children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right.&#8221; I suspect that in the not-too-distant future, we may see revelations of child abuse in fundamentalist Christian homes and churches break into the light of day that could pale by comparison the abuse scandal of the Roman Catholic Church. For the fundamentalist Christian, children too, born into &#8220;original sin&#8221;, are to be dominated and made into subservient born-again believers as soon as possible.</p> \n\n<p>Also, before turning to the Twelve Steps of Fundamentalists Anonymous., I want to emphasize that religious intoxication is an ancient theme in human history. In fact, Carl Jung would have called it an archetype&#8211;a universal theme imbedded in the human psyche that is found in all eras and cultures. According to Jung, such an archetype is not necessarily toxic or pathological but points to an inherent human craving for meaningful spiritual experiences. Whether found in the spell for the revival of Osiris, the orgiastic rites of the cult of Dionysius in Ancient Greece, or the Native American sun dance, the need for sacred ritual and celebration of the divine is as old as human history. However, need and desire are not the same as physical, emotional, or mental dependence.</p> \n\n<p>What makes a belief system, a ritual, or one&#8217;s relationship with other adherents addictive is the dependence one has on them. Is one able to think for oneself? Is one able to function without incessant participation in the rituals, and without obsessive contact with and validation from fellow devotees? Is one able to trust one&#8217;s intellect and emotions and not subordinate them to those who claim to have more spiritual authority, deeper spiritual understanding, or more extensive training in interpreting the Bible or other sacred writings?</p> \n\n<p>In exploring this topic, a caveat is in order for all who are atheist, agnostic, or offended by the mention of &#8220;God&#8221; in the Twelve Steps. After many years of working with the Steps and atheists and agnostics who utilize them, I have discovered that there are many ways to interpret and apply the concept of a Higher Power, so I would ask the atheist or agnostic reader to consider this and continue reading.</p> \n\n<p>Why do I think that Christian fundamentalism and/or Domininonism is an addiction? My answer to that question comes first of all from my own experience, as well as my observation of these individuals over the years. I recall my own dependency on what &#8220;the Bible says&#8221;&#8211;my own inability to trust my thoughts and feelings. I remember the need for the &#8220;fix&#8221; of the church service, the revival meeting, the prayer meeting, the Bible study, or listening to a fiery sermon on tape. I knew how to think on my own, but I was afraid to do so. Who knew what I might discover? But no &#8220;fix&#8221; was more deliciously validating than &#8220;winning souls for Christ&#8221;&#8211;that dramatic moment when I had manipulated someone else into a born-again experience. For this, the fundamentalist Christian addict lives and breathes. And this is precisely why the religious right is intractably hell-bent on converting the entire society and system of government in America to its fundamentalist theocracy. What could produce a greater &#8220;high&#8221;? And if this project should get interrupted by the Rapture, the resulting euphoria would be so well-earned&#8211;doing God&#8217;s work and getting the planet ready for Jesus&#8217; return. The adrenaline-drenched grandiosity in such a scenario is palpably tantalizing. More addictive than heroin perhaps?</p> \n\n<p>It is axiomatic in Christian fundamentalism that without the born-again experience, one cannot think clearly. Being born into the human condition, and therefore, being inherently sinful, one&#8217;s mind is deluded, clouded, and always potential putty in the hands of Satan. Once one has been born again, the mind is magically transformed, and one is now guided by the Holy Spirit who Jesus said would lead his followers into all truth. The more the born-again believer reads and studies the Bible, the more clearly and correctly he/she thinks. Therefore, the new convert to fundamentalist Christianity must depend on his/her minister, Bible teacher, evangelist, or other spiritual leader to interpret the Bible and guide him/her in living the Christian life. Eventually, with years of seasoning in the faith, one needs less guidance, but one always requires regular contact with the church, prayer group, or Bible study circle because even after decades of devotion, there is always the possibility that one could be deceived by the devil. Therefore, thinking for oneself is out of the question, and as a result, profound dependence on others is created for producing the &#8220;answers&#8221; one cannot discern by thinking for oneself.</p> \n\n<p>In one of the responses to my last article, one actively fundamentalist reader, whom I am paraphrasing, stated that he does look to the Bible for answers and asked to whom or what else he should look&#8211;Darwin, Camus, or other great minds? I found the question itself very telling because inherent in it is the assumption that one cannot or should not trust oneself. This assumption constitutes the major underpinning of the addiction to Christian fundamentalism, hence Step One of Fundamentalists Anonymous:</p> \n\n<p>1. I realize that I had turned control of my mind over to another person or group, who had assumed power over my thinking.</p> \n\n<p>The convert to fundamentalist Christianity must be convinced that his/her thinking is irreparably in error. The underlying message is: &#8220;You don&#8217;t believe the Bible is the inerrant Word of God because your mind has been occupied by Satan. This has happened principally because you are a human being, but also because you have made the enormous mistake of trying to think for yourself. Of course you think there are contradictions in the Bible because Satan controls your mind. If you surrender your mind to Jesus (actually to me/us/the enlightened flock of believers), you will understand that there are no contradictions in the Bible and that your life should be guided only by the Bible and nothing else. What you cannot now understand, you must take on faith, and more will be revealed to you later. It may not be revealed on this earth, but by accepting Christ as your personal savior and having faith, you will be guaranteed eternity in heaven where everything you never understood will be completely revealed to you.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Curiously, as stated in the definition of addiction above, under ancient Roman law, addiction was grounds for slavery. I found this detail particularly significant because obviously, addicted people are &#8220;enslaved&#8221; people</p> \n\n<p>Any thinking person reading the Bible will discover dozens, if not hundreds, of contradictions. Moreover, any Bible student who also studies history will discover massive discrepancies regarding which books were chosen to be in the Bible and why. Studying that history reveals that the decision to incorporate certain books and exclude others was primarily a fourth-century political decision intended to strengthen the appeal of Christianity and prevent its demise in the face of Rome&#8217;s attempts to extinguish the religion.</p> \n\n<p>An excellent analysis of this controversy has been done by religious historian, Elaine Pagels in her book <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Beyond Belief</a>. She explores the discoveries of the Nag Hammadi Library in Upper Egypt in 1945, which unearthed the existence of numerous gospels eliminated from the final canon of the New Testament. Both Pagels and another Biblical scholar, Marvin Meyer, have analyzed the Nag Hammadi writings and hypothesized the reasons for their exclusion. I particularly enjoyed reading Pagels&#8217; Beyond Belief, because not only does she analyze the controversy surrounding the exclusion of these Gnostic Gospels, but she openly shares her own intellectual process of discovering the significance of their exclusion and its impact on her own spirituality. Very UN-fundamentalist indeed.</p> \n\n<p>Reading the research of Pagels and others makes clear the reality that the Bible is not and cannot be the inerrant, impeccably-written, divinely dictated Word of God that fundamentalist Christians claim it to be. Thus Step Two of Fundamentalists Anonymous states:</p> \n\n<p>2. That person or group persuaded me of the inerrancy of the Bible, in spite of its many internal contradictions.</p> \n\n<p>One of the most significant aspects of my abandonment of Christian fundamentalism was the awareness that born-again Christians worship the Bible and not God. They argue that the only way to know God is through the Bible. They are forced to believe this because if they concede that God might speak through an inner voice, through a tree, or through a particular life experience, their entire belief system is toast. When I realized that contrary to their much-touted Ten Commandments, Bible worship is nothing less than &#8220;having other gods before me&#8221;, I finally realized the depth of the hypocrisy of their system. Part of my, and anyone&#8217;s recovery from fundamentalism is a commitment to develop a relationship with a Higher Power&#8211;whatever that may be&#8211;and not with a book. Step Three therefore states:</p> \n\n<p>3. I became addicted to the Bible as the supreme focus of my faith, in spite of the commandment that God should come first.</p> \n\n<p>Like the spiritual inventory of Alcoholics Anonymous and other Twelve-Step programs, Step Four asks the recovering fundamentalist to look at the damage one has done to oneself as a result of turning control of one&#8217;s mind over to another person or group. Not a pretty picture in most cases, but certainly a huge relief when the whole truth is finally faced and spoken.</p> \n\n<p>4. I admit to God, to myself and to another person the shortcomings of my belief in the unbelievable.</p> \n\n<p>Fundamentalist Christianity is filled with false claims about the Bible. It has to be in order to keep its system intact and use the Bible to manipulate, control, and above all, gain converts. So as part of recovering from addiction to fundamentalism, one must examine the various false claims one has made about the Bible. Step Five states:</p> \n\n<p>5. I have made an inventory of my false claims about the Bible.</p> \n\n<p>Ouch! This could be very painful&#8211;and it could go on for years as one recalls all the times one may have used &#8220;the Bible says&#8221; to beat up oneself or someone else. But again, there can be profound liberation with truth-telling.</p> \n\n<p>Could it get more painful than Steps Four and Five? Yes. How many minds have I whacked beside my own? Who have I manipulated, controlled, cajoled, or conned by using false claims&#8211;things I could never absolutely know or prove about the Bible?</p> \n\n<p>6. I have made a list of those whom I led into confusion about the Bible.</p> \n\n<p>All Twelve Step programs require &#8220;searching and fearless&#8221; inventories of oneself and one&#8217;s actions while practicing one&#8217;s addiction. Moreover, they demand accountability to one&#8217;s Higher Power, oneself, and the persons harmed.</p> \n\n<p>This could be excruciating! Admitting to someone that I may have led them astray with the Bible? As experienced Twelve-Steppers know, it may not be possible to make the amends in person or even by letter. Someone may be so hurt, so angry, so alienated that making contact with him/her is not feasible. Most important, however, is the admission to oneself. Hence Step Seven:</p> \n\n<p>7. I am willing to make amends to all those whom I may have led astray.</p> \n\n<p>And now comes the payoff: sanity. Sanity is not a mental health term but rather a state of acceptance and release often attended by a sense of relief. After one has admitted turning one&#8217;s mind over to another person or group and has faced the devastation the addiction has caused, and if possible, made amends to those harmed, it becomes possible to experience sanity.</p> \n\n<p>Step Eight, in offering the hope of sanity refers to searching Scripture for the truth. Notice the Step says &#8220;search Scripture.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t say, &#8220;search the Scripture.&#8221; One now has the freedom to search for one&#8217;s own truth&#8211;wherever, whenever, however. Step Eight:</p> \n\n<p>8. I realize that I have the inner power to restore sanity to my life and to search Scripture for the truth.</p> \n\n<p>Having completed the first eight Steps, the recovering fundamentalist can begin authentic relationships with others regarding spirituality. No longer does one need to &#8220;be right&#8221;, convert, admonish, exhort, or teach. The first eight Steps make it possible to share on a truly level playing field without right/wrong, either/or dichotomies. Step Nine:</p> \n\n<p>9. I will reach out to friends who can help me clarify my thinking about the Bible, God and Jesus.</p> \n\n<p>Reaching out to friends is not the same as dependence. It means information-gathering, exploring, dialoging, but most importantly, thinking for oneself.</p> \n\n<p>Then brilliantly, Step Ten hastens to add that I do not need to figure it out all on my own; I can ask for help from a Higher Power. It humbly implies that I don&#8217;t have all the answers. I have help, but it is with my own mind that I grasp the truth, not with someone else&#8217;s.</p> \n\n<p>10. I confess that only with God&#8217;s help can my mind grasp the truth.</p> \n\n<p>How do I get help from a Higher Power? I practice Step Eleven which deals with conscious contact with that power. This may have nothing to do with reading the Bible or going to church. It may have nothing to do with meditating in a lotus posture or praying in the traditional sense. It may mean journaling, spending time in nature, painting, composing music or poetry.</p> \n\n<p>11. I will seek through prayer and meditation to improve my conscious contact with God, praying for knowledge of God&#8217;s will for me and the power to carry that out.</p> \n\n<p>One of the most profound aspects of recovering from any addiction is the compassion one experiences for others who are still ensnared in the addiction. One naturally wants to share the liberation, peace, and sense of well being that one has found with others who are suffering. What might be particularly challenging for the recovering fundamentalist, however, is to share the Twelve Steps of Fundamentalists Anonymous without falling back into one&#8217;s addiction to proselytize and &#8220;being right.&#8221; So Step Twelve must be practiced sensitively and compassionately.</p> \n\n<p>12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these twelve steps, I will offer these steps to other former biblical fundamentalists.</p> \n\n<p>Some may argue that I am being judgmental and lacking compassion in this article and my former article on Christian fundamentalism. However, I do not apologize for being uncompromising in my analysis. As with all addictions, compassion for the addict does not mean condoning addictive behavior. It means speaking the truth about the addiction to the addict him/herself, to the family and loved ones involved with the addict, or anyone else affected by his/her behavior. This is referred to in recovery circles as an intervention. Is it not appropriate for critically thinking individuals who desire to live in a diverse and open society to conduct &#8220;interventions&#8221; when those drunk on Dominionism and fundamentalist Christianity flagrantly attempt to construct a theocracy which requires everyone to be a born-again Christian in order to thrive in that society? Do we not have a moral obligation to confront destructive religious intoxication that tears apart families, communities, and nations? Hopefully, this article is an example of such an intervention.</p> \n\n<p>The mainstream media does not seem to comprehend the inherent danger of the religious right let alone report it accurately. All of us need to challenge the addictive tyranny of Christian fundamentalism at every turn&#8211;for the sake of our sanity and for the sake of our civil liberties. We don&#8217;t allow street junkies into the halls of Congress, the Supreme Court, or the pulpits of America to admonish us how we should live and why we should demolish our Constitution. In fact, we confront the insanity and criminality of such individuals. Similarly, it&#8217;s time to confront the domination drug for what it is&#8211;a grave and perverse spiritual and moral illness.</p> \n\n<p>CAROLYN BAKER is recovering fundamentalist Christian and an adjunct professor of history living in Southern New Mexico.

Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever. \" <a href=\"http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Psa&amp;amp;c=12&amp;amp;v=1&amp;amp;t=kjv\" type=\"external\">Psalm 12:6,7</a></p> \n\n<p>There are many good works that one can read on the authority of the King James Bible, and this particular effort offers nothing really new. However, it does attempt to explain the issue in a simple and brief manner for all to understand. Over the years I have learned a great deal about this issue, and I believe that a truth worth learning is a truth worth telling. Many preachers and teachers across our land talk about \"preferring\" and \"using\" the KJV, but I haven't heard them speak much about BELIEVING it. Many prefer it and use it, because that's what their congregations prefer and use, but they do not BELIEVE it to be the infallible words of God. They are taught in college to USE, PREFER, and RECOMMEND the KJV, but they are NOT taught to BELIEVE it. Most \"Christian colleges\" teach that the King James Bible is only a translation, and that NO translation is infallible. Consequently, the average minister today uses a Book which he doesn't even believe. Now, I thank God that I don't have that problem. I don't have to play make-believe with anyone about the word of God. I believe it. I believe the King James Bible is the preserved and infallible words of God. It doesn't merely \"contain\" the word of God: it IS the word of God. I'm absolutely sure of it, and I'd like to give a few reasons why. Here are twelve reasons how I know that the KJV is the word of God:</p> \n\n<p>God Promised to Preserve His Words</p> \n\n<p>Psalm 12:6-7 says, \"The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times. Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.\" Then we read in Psalm 100:5 that \". . . . his truth endureth to all generations,\" and Jesus said in John 17:17 that God's WORD is truth. These words state very clearly that God's preserved word MUST be available to us today, because God PROMISED to preserve it for us. There MUST be an infallible Book somewhere. You say, \"But ALL translations are God's word, not just one.\" That's impossible, because the various translations contain different readings, and God is not the author of confusion (I Cor. 14:33). Besides, if all of the versions are the word of God, then where are the \"corrupt\" and \"perverted\" versions that we are warned about in II Corinthians 2:17 and Jeremiah 23:36? If everyone is innocent, then where are those who are said to be GUILTY of subtracting from and adding to the word of God (Rev. 22:18-19)? God wouldn't have warned us about Bible perversion if it wasn't going to be a reality. According to the scriptures, there must be a single Book that is the word of God, and there must be MANY which are involved in CORRUPTING the word of God. Now, if the Authorized Version isn't the infallible word of God, then WHAT IS? There has to be a Book somewhere in \"all generations\" which is God's word; so what book is it? Those who \"use\" the new versions believe that these are good and reliable translations, but they do NOT believe these to be INFALLIBLE translations. However, I know MANY people who believe the King James Bible to be an infallible Book. Why? Because they know that the One True God has ONE TRUE BOOK. He promised to preserve His words, and we believe that He has done just that. Jesus said, \"Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away\" (Matthew 24:35). If His words didn't pass away, then where are they? I want to read them. There has to be a perfect volume somewhere. I know the King James Bible is the word of God because God promised to preserve His words.</p> \n\n<p>The Authorized Version Was Translated Under A God-Ordained English King</p> \n\n<p>The main subject of the Bible is the kingdom which God intends to give to His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, Who will be crowned \"KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS,\" according to Revelation 19:16. Ecclesiastes 8:4 says, \"Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?\" Unlike the modern versions, the KJV was translated under a king. In fact, the king's name was \"James,\" which is the English word for \"Jacob,\" whom God renamed \"Israel,\" because he had power with God and with men (Gen. 32:28). The new versions have been translated in America, which is not a monarchy. God's form of government is a theocratic monarchy, not a democracy. Therefore, it makes perfect sense that His word would be translated for the English speaking people under a monarchy with an English king. I know the King James Bible is the word of God because it was translated under a king.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Because God Always Translates Perfectly</p> \n\n<p>The words \"translate\" and \"translated\" occur three times in the Bible, and GOD is the Translator each time. The scholars insist that the KJV cannot be infallible, because it is \"only a translation.\" Do you suppose that such scholars have checked II Samuel 3:10, Colossians 1:13, and Hebrews 11:5 to see what GOD has to say about translating? In II Samuel 3:10 we are told that it was God Who translated Saul's kingdom to David. We are told in Colossians 1:13 that Christians have been translated into the kingdom of Jesus Christ, and Hebrews 11:5 tells us that God translated Enoch that he should not see death. God was the One doing the translating each time. What's the point? The point is that a translation CAN be perfect, if God is involved in the translating. When the New Testament writers would quote the Old Testament (Mt. 1:23; Mk. 1:2; Lk. 4:4; Jn. 15:25; Acts 1:20; 7:42; I Cor. 2:9; Gal. 3:13, etc.), they had to TRANSLATE from Hebrew to Greek, because the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, but THEY wrote in Greek. So, if a translation cannot be infallible, then EVEN THE NEW TESTAMENT IN THE \"ORIGINAL GREEK\" ISN'T INFALLIBLE, because it contains translations from the Hebrew text! Obviously God assisted them in their translating by the leadership of the Holy Spirit, and He assisted the King James translators as well. The scholars will never understand this, for most of them have QUENCHED the Holy Spirit in their own lives by looking to higher education for truth, rather than seeking the Lord's leadership (Jn. 16:13). The Holy Spirit Who inspired the word of God through \"holy men of God\" (II Pet. 1:21) is quite capable of guiding His servants to KEEP the words which Jesus told us to keep (Jn. 14:23). In essence, the KJV translators were merely INSTRUMENTS which God used in translating and preserving His word. In fact, they said this themselves in the Dedicatory to the Authorized Version: \". . . . because we are poor instruments to make God's holy truth to be yet more and more known to the people. . . \" I know the King James Bible is the word of God, because God is very capable of using anyone He pleases as His very own instruments of righteousness in order to preserve His word. <a href=\"http://www.blueletterbible.org/Bible.cfm?b=Rev&amp;amp;c=22\" type=\"external\" /> Because It Produces Good Fruit</p> \n\n<p>The Lord Jesus said that every good tree will bring forth good fruit, and we can know them BY their fruits (Mt. 7:17-20). God had the KJV translated for the purpose of bringing forth fruit, and it has been very obedient to the call. The greatest preachers of the past four centuries have been King James Bible believers. Billy Sunday is said to have led over one million people to Christ, and he was a KJV believer. Spurgeon, Moody, Whitfield, and Wesley were all KJV men, and the list goes on. God has richly blessed the ministries of such men as these because they stayed busy OBEYING His word rather than questioning its authority. The KJV produces good fruit. I was led to Christ with a King James Bible. Nearly every Christian I know was led to Christ with a KJV. Why? Because it produces good fruit. The new translations produce EVIL fruit. The modern perversions of scripture are producing infidels who do not even know what the word of God is, much less where to find it. The new translations produce spiritual babies who are totally incapable of discussing Bible doctrine. The new versions produce NEWER versions, which produce MONEY for the publishers, and I Timothy 6:10 tells us that the love of MONEY is the root of all EVIL. The Holy Spirit doesn't bear witness to the modern translations, but He DOES bear witness to the King James. I've always believed the KJV to be God's word, even before I was saved. No one ever told me to believe this, but the Holy Spirit just bore witness to the King James--not the others. After being saved, I spent several years of my Christian life not being aware of the big debate going on these days between King James Bible believers and New Age Version believers. The whole time I believed only ONE BOOK to be God's word, and even then I was suspicious of the new versions, although no one had told me to be. When I discovered that over eighty percent of the \"Christian\" schools in our nation do not believe the KJV to be the word of God, I was shocked. How is it that one comes to believe the KJV naturally, but must be EDUCATED OUT of his belief in it? Why is it that King James believers are accused of following men when GOD is the One Who led them to believe it? Why do opponents of the KJV accuse us of following men, when THEY are the ones who allowed MEN to talk them out of believing the KJV? The KJV produces good fruit, because the Holy Spirit bears witness to it like no other book in the world. It's easier to memorize than any new version, and the beautiful old English language gives the reader the impression that he is reading a Book very different and far superior to the rest. It reads different because it IS different, and it IS different because it has a different Author. We shall know them \"by their fruit\", and I know the King James Bible is the word of God, because it produces GOOD fruit.</p> \n\n<p>Because the King James Translators Believed They Were Handling the Very Words of God</p> \n\n<p>One can see this truth by reading the Prefatory and Dedicatory remarks in the Authorized Version. These men didn't believe they were handling \"God's message\" or \"reliable manuscripts.\" They believed they were handling the very words of God Himself. As I Thessalonians 2:13 says, they \". . . . received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.\" Like the serpent of Genesis 3:1, modern translators approach the scriptures in skepticism, saying, \"Yea, hath God said?\" This was the first recorded sin in the Bible, and it still runs rapid through the hearts and minds of most scholars and new version promoters. God has always allowed such people to be DECEIVED because of the IDOLS in their hearts (Ezek. 14:1-9; II Thess. 2:10-12; I Kings 22). A man who lacks faith in God's word is in no condition to translate it. This eliminates every revision committee in the past one hundred years, because these committees have consisted mostly of highly educated men who were heady, high-minded, and proud, thinking that their intelligence qualified them to tamper with the pure words of God. The KJV translators were not like this. Their scholarship FAR EXCEEDED that of modern translators, yet they remained humble and allowed God to use them in order to produce an infallible masterpiece. They didn't set out to \"judge\" and \"correct\" the word of God. Their purpose was to translate God's word for the English speaking people, as they were told to do by their appointed king. I know the King James Bible is the word of God because the KJV translators believed it themselves. Because the King James Translators Were Honest In Their Work</p> \n\n<p>The critics of the KJV enjoy making a fuss about the words in italics, which were added by the translators, but the argument is entirely unnecessary and unfair. The italic words in the KJV actually PROVE that the translators were honest in their work. When translating from one language to another, the idioms change, thus making it necessary to add certain words to help the reader grasp the full meaning of the text. When the KJV translators added such words they set them in italics so that we'd know these words were added, UNLIKE we find it in so many new versions today, which do NOT use the italics. Besides, no one has ever PROVEN that the italic words are not the words of God, because no one has \"the originals\" to check them with. In fact, we know for sure that the translators were led by the Holy Spirit to add at least some of the italicized words. One good example of this is found in II Samuel 21:19. When the translators came to this verse in the Hebrew text, they noticed that an exact translation would give Elhanan credit for slaying Goliath, but we know from I Chronicles 20:5 that he actually slew THE BROTHER OF Goliath. So the KJV translators added the words \"the brother of\" to II Samuel 21:19. If the Lord had not led them to do so, then II Samuel 21:19 would contradict I Chronicles 20:5 (as it DOES in the New World Translation!). Another fine example is I John 2:23. The last half of the verse was missing at the time, but the KJV translators inserted it anyhow (in italics), feeling that it was necessary. This naturally disturbed many people, but since that time new manuscripts have been found which CONTAIN the last half of I John 2:23. The translators were RIGHT in adding the italicized words. One last example of the Holy Spirit's guiding influence on the KJV translators is found in Psalm 16:8, which says, \"I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.\" As you can see, the words \"he is\" are in italics. According to many scholars they should be omitted, but according to the Apostle Peter they should NOT be omitted. Peter quotes Psalm 16:8 in Acts 2:25, and he USES the italicized words! How did the translators know this if the Lord didn't lead them? The italics in the King James Bible are the marks of an HONEST translation, for no one added these words to mislead us, or to change the word of God. They added the words to help us, and they set the words in italics so we'd know they were added. That's honesty. I know the KJV is the word of God, because the translators were more honest in their work than any of the modern Bible translators. Because All New Translations Compare Themselves to the KJV</p> \n\n<p>The new versions do not compare themselves with each other, because they're too busy comparing themselves with one Book--the King James Bible. This fact alone proves that there is something very special and unique about the KJV. Why does everyone line up in opposition AGAINST the King James Bible? Why not attack one another? That's easy: Satan has no desire to divide his own kingdom (Mt. 12:26). His desire is to discredit the word of GOD, not himself; so he attacks only one Book, God's Book, the KJV. Those who oppose the KJV are unsure of themselves, for they have no Final Authority; so they despise those of us who DO have an Authority. They're unstable, insecure, dishonest, and very inconsistent. They're all TERRIFIED of One Book, the KJV, and they'll stop short of nothing in their efforts to rid the Body of Christ of that Book. I know the KJV is the word of God, because it's the standard which all others use for comparison. Because of the Time in History in Which It Was Translated</p> \n\n<p>The King James Bible was not translated during the apostate and lukewarm Laodicean church period, like the new translations. The Laodicean period is the last church period before the Second Coming of Christ. It is the last of the seven church periods in Revelation chapters two and three. One can clearly see that we are living in the Laodicean period today by simply comparing modern churches to the church of Revelation 3:14-22. This lukewarm period began toward the end of the 1800's and will continue until Christ returns. The new versions fit well into the lukewarm churches, because they are lukewarm \"bibles.\" The Authorized Version, however, was translated LONG BEFORE the Laodicean churches appeared. It was translated during the Philadelphia church period, which is the best church period of all. It was this church that the Lord Jesus COMMENDED for KEEPING HIS WORD( Rev. 3:8-10)! In 1611, when the King James Bible was completed, the scourge of lukewarm Laodicea had not yet swept over the world. There was no \"scientific\" crowd around in 1611 to put pressure on the translators. There was no civil rights movement going on at this time to influence the work of these men. The women were not screaming for \"equal rights,\" and the humanists and socialists had not yet taken control. The massive army of liberal and modernistic preachers had not yet been assembled. The open public denial of God's word and the Deity of Christ was practically unheard of among ministers. It wasn't until the twentieth century that professing Christianity became flooded with lukewarm preachers who would be willing to compromise the word of God for self gain. The greatest missionary work in church history occurred between 1700 and 1900, so it makes perfect sense that God would have a Bible ready for this great work, and He did - the KJV. Unfortunately, the new translations appeared a bit LATE on the scene! Think about that. I know the KJV is the word of God because of the time in history in which it was translated. Because No One Has Ever Proven That the KJV is Not God's Word</p> \n\n<p>Any honest American should know that innocence is supposed to prevail in our land until guilt is proven. The KJV should be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Has anyone proven it guilty? No. Has any scholar actually PROVEN that there are errors in the King James Bible? No. Enemies of the KJV delight in IGNORING the facts about the Authorized Version, while never PROVING anything. All apparent \"errors\" in the KJV can be explained through prayer and a careful study of the scriptures, but the opponents of the KJV aren't interested in looking for TRUTH; they're interested attacking God's word, while never proving anything. I know the KJV is the word of God, because, over nearly four hundred years, no one has proven otherwise. Because of the Manuscript Evidence</p> \n\n<p>Only a very deceived individual could believe that the new versions are equal to the King James Bible. Ninety-five percent of all evidence SUPPORTS the text of the King James Authorized Version. The new versions are supported by the remaining five percent evidence. The new \"bibles\" are supported by two very corrupt fourth century manuscripts, known as the \"Vaticanus\" and the \"Siniaticus.\" These manuscripts are filled with many text alterations to meet the demands of Roman Catholic tradition. They also include the Apocrypha, which the Lord Jesus Christ EXCLUDED from the Old Testament in Luke 24:44. All new versions contain readings from these corrupt manuscripts, and all new versions use their tiny five percent evidence to attack the ninety-five percent majority text of the King James Bible. The Textus Receptus (received text) from which the King James Bible came can be traced clear back to Antioch, Syria, where the disciples were first called Christians and where Paul and Barnabas taught the word of God for a whole year (Acts 11:26). The other \"bibles\" do not come from Antioch. They come from Alexandria, Egypt, and from Rome. We don't need an Egyptian version, for Egypt is a type of the WORLD in the Bible. God called His people OUT of Egypt (Exod. 3-14), and God called His Son out of Egypt (Hos. 11:1 with Matt. 2:13-15). Why, the Bible says that \"every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians\" in Gen. 46:34, and the Lord Jesus Christ is called a SHEPHERD in John chapter ten. Alexandria, Egypt, is associated with SUPERSTITION in Acts 28:11, and Aquilla and Pricilla had to set an Egyptian straight on his doctrine in Acts chapter 18. Alexandrians are also found DISPUTING WITH STEPHEN in Acts 6:9. So we don't need a \"bible\" from Alexandria, Egypt. Then there's the Roman text, also called the \"Western Text.\" We can also do without a Roman \"bible\", because it was ROMAN soldiers who nailed our Lord to the cross. The harlot of Revelation 17 is a perfect description of the Roman Catholic Church, which has persecuted Christians for thousands of years. Romans persecuted the Christians in Acts18:2, and in 70 A.D. the Romans destroyed Jerusalem. Rome is the \"dreadful and terrible\" beast of Daniel chapter seven, and Christ will destroy the \"Revised Roman Empire\" at the Second Coming (Dan. 2; 7; and Rev. 13). It has been estimated that Rome is guilty of the blood of some 200 million people who have rejected her corrupt system. A \"bible\" from Rome is another thing we can live without. There's only one line of manuscripts that we can trust, and this is the line from Antioch, called the \"Syrian\" or \"Byzantine\" type text. The word of God speaks POSITIVELY of Antioch, and NEGATIVELY of Rome and Egypt. We should TAKE THE BEST AND DUMP THE REST! I know the King James Bible is the word of God because of the manuscript evidence. Because It Exalts the Lord Jesus Christ</p> \n\n<p>Jesus said, \"Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: And they are they which testify of me.\" John 5:39. A REAL Bible will testify of the Lord Jesus Christ. The true word of God will always EXALT Jesus Christ, and it will NEVER attack Hid Deity, His Virgin Birth, His Blood Atonement, His Bodily Resurrection, His Glorious Second Coming, or any other doctrines concerning His Person. However, the new versions attack ALL of the fundamental doctrines concerning the Lord Jesus Christ at one time or another. By perverting the many important verses of scripture which deal with the fundamental doctrines of Christ, the new \"bibles\" have a CONTINUOUS ATTACK launched against our beloved Savior, and this is NOT an overstatement! His Virgin Birth is under attack in Isaiah 7:14, Luke 1:34, and Luke 2:33. His Blood Atonement is under attack in Colossians 1:14, Acts 20:28, Ephesians 1:7, and Revelation 1:5. The Bodily Resurrection is under attack in Acts 1:3, Luke chapter 24, and the last twelve verses of Mark. His Deity is under attack in Acts 10:28, John 9:35, and I Timothy 3:16. The new versions attack the Second Coming in Revelation 11:15, and Titus 2:13, and the list goes on, because the new versions have an extreme bitter HATRED toward the Authorized Version and the way it gives the Lord Jesus Christ the preeminent place. If the reader doubts this, we challenge you to take whatever version you want and compare the above verses in it to the same verses in the King James Bible. If you still doubt it, after checking the verses, then write us and we will send you a great many more references to check. The new \"bibles\" have a very consistent record of attacking the Lord Jesus Christ; so they cannot possibly be \"the scriptures\" that He said would testify of Him in John 5:39. They testify AGAINST him. The King James Bible NEVER attacks our Lord. More than any book in the world, the Authorized Version of the Protestant Reformation EXALTS the Lord Jesus Christ. If we had no other reason for receiving the Authorized Version as the word of God, this reason alone should be enough to convince any true believer, for how could we not become suspicious of the new versions for making such changes?

Having reached a point of godlike abilities, the power and exponential growth of technology is both wondrous and ominous.</p> \n\n<p>Disney&#8217;s 1982&amp;#160;Tron&amp;#160;is directly relevant to this topic, though it&#8217;s often only remembered for its advanced special effects (for the time) and spectacular art direction, while the deeper elements of its story have remained hidden. In this article, I intend to highlight the many revelations&amp;#160;Trongave us about the future, especially in light of the open sourced information we have seen in the last few years revolving around DARPA and the Pentagon&#8217;s black projects.</p> \n\n<p>As most of us are now approaching two decades of familiarity with the Internet, it becomes fuzzier and fuzzier trying to recall those bygone days when we needed to find an actual phone line to make a call. It is even more difficult to think of the close of the 70s and the early 80s and what must&#8217;ve been in the minds of most viewers in 1982 after seeing&amp;#160;Tron.</p> \n\n<p>As a child of the 80s, I recall seeing it as a young guy, yet nothing stuck with me other than its surreal mix of German Expressionism and Atari-style visuals. Lurking below all of this was actually a highly sagacious form of predictive programming and acclimatization, something now evident upon review. Disney has long been united with the Pentagon and of more recent alliance, the Siemens Corporation, in implementing the latest technological advances for its films and theme parks. I have highlighted this dark alliance here,&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://jaysanalysis.com/2014/06/27/magickal-kingdom-ultra-escape-from-tomorrow-and-sinister-disney/\" type=\"external\">detailing the revelation of its vast psychological warfare prowess</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Since 80s films are some of my most popular articles, upon reviewing&amp;#160;Tron&amp;#160;(after many years), and&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://jaysanalysis.com/2011/01/09/tron-legacy-esoteric-analysis/\" type=\"external\">having analyzed the recent sequel</a>, I was struck by how much more was subtly revealed in the original. Since the film references Artificial Intelligence, the Internet, virtual worlds, game theory and video gaming, the shadow military establishment, and much, much more, we can begin to gain a picture of the reality of the whispered notion that the technological elite truly are 30-40 years ahead of the public. Again, it is crucial to keep in mind as you read and perhaps review the film, you are watching something that was in theaters in 1982! While people were playing Pac-Man and Atari arcade games, the establishment tech elites were integrating the already-existing Internet across the US to form the emerging Skynet tech grid we are in 2014 going under.</p> \n\n<p>Long before&amp;#160;The Matrix, a similar plot had already described the heart of the coming &#8220;new world order.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"https://jaysanalysis.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/tron3.png\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>The apex of the pyramid shines its red Illuminist light.</p> \n\n<p>In fact, it is not well-known that video games themselves arose from&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3131181/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/pentagon-cia-enlist-video-games/#.VChK_UpX-uY\" type=\"external\">Pentagon military training ideas, combined with high level mathematics and game theory</a>. Thinkers from the Rand Corporation as well as the work of John Nash would come together to produce the foundation for the rise of the virtual and its social engineering application. Also significant was James Bamford&#8217;s 1982 book&amp;#160;The Puzzle Palace, which revealed the existence of the NSA&amp;#160;at that time. Meanwhile, the public has only now come to realize there is such an organization, while the media was denying the existence of such an entity into the late 90s!&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Tron&amp;#160;was truly a preparatory acclimatization to the coming aeon like few films were, and it has been largely missed (but not by JaysAnalysis). The movie-going public of 1982 had been awestruck by sci-fi spectacles like&amp;#160;2001: A Space Odyssey&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;Star Wars, both of which are superior films to&amp;#160;Tron, yet neither epic had revealed whatTron&amp;#160;would reveal.</p> \n\n<p>On top of all this,&amp;#160;Tron&amp;#160;is not merely a revelation of secret, advanced technology, but is in fact laced with occult, gnostic and Platonic ideas, which I will now examine&#8230;</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://jaysanalysis.com/2014/09/28/tron-1982-the-ultimate-predictive-programming/\" type=\"external\">Continue reading this article at Jay&#8217;s Analysis</a></p> \n\n<p>READ MORE HOLLYWOOD NEWS AT:&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">21st Century Wire Hollywood Files</a></p> \n\n<p>&#8211;</p>", "title": "TRON (1982) \u2013 The Ultimate in Predictive Programming", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://21stcenturywire.com/2014/09/29/tron-1982-the-ultimate-predictive-programming/", "published_at": "2014-09-29", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Isn&#8217;t it an amazing coincidence how rappers all loved Trump, but then he suddenly became a racist when he took on the establishment?</p> \n\n<p>Please share this video! <a href=\"https://youtu.be/3jFJTZkMc40\" type=\"external\">https://youtu.be/3jFJTZkMc40</a></p> \n\n<p>SUBSCRIBE on YouTube:</p> \n\n<p>Follow on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PrisonPlanet\" type=\"external\">Follow @PrisonPlanet</a></p> \n\n<p>Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/paul.j.watson.71\" type=\"external\">https://www.facebook.com/paul.j.watson.71</a></p> \n\n<p>*********************</p> \n\n<p>Paul Joseph Watson is the editor at large of <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Infowars.com</a> and <a href=\"http://prisonplanet.com/\" type=\"external\">Prison Planet.com</a>.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Eminem is a Complete Idiot", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://infowars.com/eminem-is-a-complete-idiot/", "published_at": "2017-10-11", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>New MSNBC host Ronan Farrow, son of actress Mia Farrow and former Hillary Clinton special advisor on global youth issues, had some interesting words on why the world needed another Clinton administration.</p> \n\n<p>After MSNBC contributor Ari Melber spelled out how honest the Clintons were on gay marriage - \"they both changed and most extraordinarily and most rarely, the president came out and said he was wrong essentially to sign DOMA and what do you think that evolution tells us about the ability to move from the&amp;#160;'90s to now\" - Farrow concluded, \"they're nimble politicians, also, I think they represent a style of honesty that the public craves right now.\"</p> \n\n<p>President Clinton was impeached in the House for committing perjury, and Hillary Clinton has long been one of the least truthful politicians in America.&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "MSNBC's Farrow: Clintons 'Represent a Style of Honesty That The Public Craves Right Now'", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://truthrevolt.org/news/msnbcs-farrow-clintons-represent-style-honesty-public-craves-right-now", "published_at": "2018-10-07", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>This is a teachable moment for the nation that presents an opportunity to transform policing so it serves the people.</p> \n\n<p>The killing of Michael Brown by a Ferguson, MO police officer, who was identified Friday as Darren Wilson, and the aftermath in which nonviolent protesters and reporters were met with a violent and militarized police force have exposed something that has been building for years.

He makes no bones about thinking that anyone other than a Muslim doesn&#8217;t deserve anything and are less than Muslims. In fact, part of Yasir Qadhi&#8217;s preaching includes rhetoric that says non-Muslims lives are forfeit and their property is legal for Muslims to take in jihad, (and this would include women as sex slaves)&amp;#160; Recently Yasir Qadhi said that &#8220;Jews and Christians filthy, their lives and property can be taken in jihad by the Muslims.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Yasir Qadhi is not only a Memphil Imam, but is is also the Dean of Academic Affairs at the Al-Maghrib Institute. He is a hafiz (has memorized the Qur&#8217;an) and he has an M.A. in the Islamic Creed and a B.A. in Islamic Sciences from Islamic University of Medina, as well as a master&#8217;s and a doctorate in Islamic Studies from Yale.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/cdn.freedomoutpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/yasir-qadhi.jpg\" type=\"external\" />During a lecture on Shirk, or polytheism, Yasir Qadhi said that Jews and Christians are mushrikoon, or polytheists, because they have made partners with Allah. From Yasir Qadhi&#8217;s perspective, only Muslims are monotheists.</p> \n\n<p>He also claims that it is the responsibility of every single human being to bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah, and him alone.</p> \n\n<p>Now pay attention here. Yasir Qadhi now will tell you what the result and command that stems from this twisted principle.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;And it is because of this same principle of monotheism that the prophet has been commanded to do jihad.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>OK, now we&#8217;re getting somewhere. Did all of you alleged &#8220;moderate&#8221; Muslims out there get that? Of course, you did. You know this. You know jihad is not just some internal struggle. It isn&#8217;t about losing weight or getting in shape or some personal goal to be obtained. It is a holy war to advance the caliphate, the Islamic State.</p> \n\n<p>While jihad is not the goal, Qadhi says, it is the means. &#8220;It is a means to establish monotheism on the land,&#8221; Qadhi says.</p> \n\n<p>Let me translate that for any who are still skeptical and buying into the lie that Islam is peaceful. Jihad is a means, a violent means, to an end, or goal, where Islam dominates the United States. In fact, Islam believes it will dominate the world, and I emphasize the word dominate.</p> \n\n<p>Qadhi claims that he &#8220;has been commanded to fight the people until they testify.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The whole reason why Allah has created us and sent the prophet and revealed the books, and differentiated us based upon this principle and allowed for jihad, is the basis and is the principle of monotheism,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;The life and property of a &#8220;Mushrik&#8221; (someone who does not worship Allah) holds no value in the state of jihad.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>As if that wasn&#8217;t outlandish enough, Yasir Qadhi continues by attempting to differentiate that life is valuable at times, just not when jihad is going on. Well, who knows when that is going on?</p> \n\n<p>Qadhi said, &#8220;The life and property of a mushrik [one who worships others besides Allah] holds no value in the state of jihad&#8230;.which means if they don&#8217;t sayla illaha illa Allah, their lives and property are halal&#8221; &#8212; that is, permitted to be taken by the Muslims. &#8220;The prophet, and I quoted the hadith before, &#8216;I have been commanded to fight the people until&#8221; they profess that there is no god but Allah, and once they convert to Islam, &#8220;their life and property become protected from them.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>What does all of that mean? I&#8217;m glad you asked and so is Yasir Qadhi. This &#8220;means if they don&#8217;t&#8221; convert to Islam, &#8220;their life and property are halal (or in this case, free for the taking legally) for the muslims.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He then goes on to say that Christians commit &#8220;shirk,&#8221; they are unbelievers, and they are polytheists.</p> \n\n<p>Then he gets into ad hominem attacks on Christians. &#8220;They are filthy, a spiritual filthiness which can only be purified by the purity of tawheed (monotheism).&#8221; He then adds that Allah believes anyone who is not a Muslim is a &#8220;nudge.&#8221; In other words, a nudge, in Arabic is &#8220;najasa,&#8221; and it means that you are &#8220;feces, urine, filthy, or contaminated.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Well, I have news for Yasir Qadhi and all Muslims. The God of the Bible says you are filthy and you distort his teachings and he will come one day to judge you, but should you fail to repent and believe the gospel of Jesus Christ and seek to pursue a jihad on American soil, we will see your jihad and raise you another crusade if you seek to push this filthy, backwards, disgusting and immoral ideology of Islam on us.</p> \n\n<p>What are your thoughts?</p> \n\n<p>Tim Brown is the Editor of <a href=\"http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/10/tennessee-imam-abu-ammaar-yasir-qadhi-jews-christians-filthy-lives-property-can-taken-jihad-muslims/\" type=\"external\">Freedom Outpost</a>.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />", "title": "Tennessee Imam Abu Ammaar Yasir Qadhi: \u201cJews and Christians are Filthy, Their Lives and Property can be Taken in Jihad by the Muslims\u201d", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://dcclothesline.com/2013/10/30/tennessee-imam-abu-ammaar-yasir-qadhi-jews-christians-filthy-lives-property-can-taken-jihad-muslims/", "published_at": "2013-10-30", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">LinkedIn</a> Corp will seek out opportunities in <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">China</a> to capitalize on its massive user base even though it sees the market as complicated, a company executive said on Thursday.</p> \n\n<p>LinkedIn, a professional social-networking-site, has a small presence in the country and is one of the few foreign social-networking-sites to still have access to Chinese Internet users. <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Facebook</a> are blocked in China.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>\"It (China) is a very competitive market,\" Arvind Rajan, Vice President of Asia Pacific and Japan at Linkedin told reporters on the sidelines of a conference.</p> \n\n<p>\"There are political challenges, technical challenges.

That fact was first reported by Gun Week in 2003, the tabloid newspaper that has since evolved into <a href=\"http://www.thegunmag.com\" type=\"external\">TheGunMag.com</a>, a monthly print and digital magazine published by the Second Amendment Foundation.</p> \n\n<p>Gun Week uncovered an intense nationwide search for the gun by federal agents who had been contacting owners of Makarov pistols with replacement barrels. When the Seattle Times picked up the story, Gun Week's role was relegated to the 30th paragraph.</p> \n\n<p>According to Politico, 79 percent of voters support a ban on bump stocks, which are after-market products that replace the stock and pistol grip on a semi-auto rifle and allow it to be fired at a fast rate using the gun's recoil to enable shooters to press the trigger faster. According to published reports, investigators found a dozen guns in the Mandalay Bay hotel room occupied by killer Stephen Paddock that had been fitted with the devices.</p> \n\n<p>Politico also reported that 64 percent of voters support stricter gun laws, while only 29 percent oppose tougher laws. That's a slight change from this past June, when 61 percent supported stronger laws and 33 percent opposed the notion.</p> \n\n<p>The poll also revealed that 49 percent of Republican voters want stricter gun laws, and 45 percent oppose them. Among Democrats, 83 percent want tougher gun laws, while only 12 percent of Democrats oppose stricter laws. Fifty-eight percent of independents support stricter laws, Politico reported.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/354856-majority-backs-stricter-gun-control-after-las-vegas-shooting\" type=\"external\">The Hill</a> noted that the Las Vegas attack \"has reignited the debate over gun control policies on Capitol Hill.\" There is also a piece on guns in <a href=\"http://crosscut.com/2017/10/democrats-republicans-agree-gun-control-reform-las-vegas-mass-shooting/\" type=\"external\">Crosscut</a>, a Northwest publication, authored by longtime conservative Seattle talk host John Carlson.</p> \n\n<p>Authorities still have not been able to determine a motive for the attack, which claimed 58 lives and left hundreds injured. Paddock was hardly a blip on anyone's radar prior to the attack. He had no criminal record, so he was able to pass multiple background checks while acquiring firearms over a period stretching back months, if not years.</p> \n\n<p>Polling results such as these tend to have one consistent result. They spur gun sales. Talk of banning bump stocks ignited something of a fire sale, and now it is nearly impossible to find the devices , which most of America hadn't heard of prior to the Oct. 1 Las Vegas mayhem.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>(Source: FBI National Instant Check System)</p> \n\n<p>A check on raw data from the FBI on National Instant Checks for the month of September shows checks were down from September 2016, but not that far. Last year, there were 1,992,219 NICS checks for September, and last month there were 1,967,104 NICS checks.</p> \n\n<p>According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation's adjusted figures, there were 1,019,037 checks, constituting an 11.9 percent decrease.</p> \n\n<p>However, the attack occurred Oct. 1, so it remains to be seen whether all of the subsequent talk about gun control will spike gun sales this month.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "Poll: Support up for stricter gun laws following Las Vegas", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://conservativefiringline.com/poll-support-stricter-gun-laws-following-las-vegas/", "published_at": "2017-10-11", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Shares of Coeur Mining (NYSE: CDE), a gold and silver mining company with properties located in North and South America, as well as Australia, surged 28% during January according to data from <a href=\"http://marketintelligence.spglobal.com/\" type=\"external\">S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence Opens a New Window.</a>. The impetus for that strong surge can be traced to three primary catalysts.</p> \n\n<p>Arguably, the biggest catalyst came early in January, when Coeur Mining announced its 2016 production figures and provided its 2017 production forecast, both of which were met with thunderous applause from Wall Street.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Getty Images.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>For the fourth quarter, Coeur wound up producing 3.9 million ounces of silver and 102,500 ounces of gold, which works out to 10 million total silver equivalent ounces (SEO). For the full year, production totaled 14.8 million ounces of silver and 358,170 ounces of gold. The company's own guidance had called for 14.4 million to 15.7 million ounces of silver (so it was right in line), but just 333,000 to 355,000 ounces of gold, meaning it beat its guidance. Much of the credit for that goes to the company's Wharf mine in South Dakota, which produced 110,927 gold equivalent ounces (GEO) in 2016, up from 79,061 GEO in 2015.</p> \n\n<p>Looking ahead, Coeur Mining anticipates production of 16.4 million to 18 million ounces of silver and 362,000 to 387,000 ounces of gold in 2017. Figured in SEO, this represents a 9% increase at the midpoint from its 2016 production levels.</p> \n\n<p>Secondly, Coeur Mining announced on Jan. 17 that it would be selling its Joaquin Project, located inArgentina's southern Santa Cruz province, to Pan American Silver (NASDAQ: PAAS). The deal nets Coeur $15 million in upfront cash and $10 million in Pan American Silver stock, as well as a 2% net smelter returns royalty. The deal will allow Coeur to focus on more immediate projects, while giving Pan American Silver another asset in close proximity to its Manantial Espejo operation.</p> \n\n<p>Finally, silver prices rebounded nicely as the U.S. dollar got off to its worst start in 30 years. Higher silver prices should translate into juicier margins for mining companies.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Getty Images.</p> \n\n<p>Coeur Mining has really been firing on all cylinders as of late, even if its all-in sustaining costs (AISC) are higher than those of most of its peers. What investors should understand about Coeur is that it's right in the middle of a major transition. It's moving from being both an open-pit and an underground mining company to a wholly underground-mining operation. It's definitely costly to make that transition, but the long-term benefit is that ore grades underground are much higher, and capital expenditures should also decline once the transition is complete.</p> \n\n<p>More importantly, Coeur has some major projects set to begin commercial production in 2018 and 2019. The C1 Santa Luz and Cerro Moro projects are slated to start commercial production next year, with Santa Luz expected to be capable of producing 130,000 ounces of gold in its first year.

Am I sleeping now? Tomorrow, when I wake, or think I do, what shall I say of today?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8211;Samuel Beckett&#8217;s Vladimir</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;For many, the theatre is the abode where dreams are created. You, players, sellers of drugs, in your darkened houses people are changed into kings and perform heroic deeds of safety. In rapture over themselves, or seized with pity they sit in happy distraction, forgetting the toils of daily life. Runaways&#8230;.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8211;Bertolt Brecht</p> \n\n<p>In his epic theater, Bertolt Brecht sought to illuminate the historically specific features of an environment in order to show how that environment influenced, shaped, and often battered and destroyed the characters. Unlike dramatists who focused on the universal elements of the human condition and fate, Brecht was interested in the attitudes and behavior people adopted toward each other in specific historical situations.</p> \n\n<p>In Mahagonny and The Threepenny Opera Brecht demonstrated how people relate to each other in capitalist societies. In Mother Courage, he showed how tradespeople related to soldiers and civilians during war in an emerging market society. In The Measures Taken, Brecht depicted revolutionary relationships in the struggle in China. He believed that with this &#8220;historicization&#8221; one would have the best possible chance to adopt a critical attitude toward one&#8217;s society. Brecht wanted audiences to view present social arrangements and institutions as historical, transitory, and subject to change. Epic theater was intended to show emotions, ideas, and behavior as products of, or responses to, specific social situations and not as the unfolding of the human essence.</p> \n\n<p>When you see Brad Pitt or Jennifer Aniston in the movies or on televison, their vehicle &#8211;the particular dramatization&#8211; is not intended to &#8220;estrange&#8221; or &#8220;distance&#8221; the spectator, preventing empathy or identification with situations and characters; a critical attitude toward the actions of a given plot is not encouraged. They are not paid to detour empathetic illusion or a mimesis of reality. On the contrary, their bosses do not want them to expose the workings of societal processes and human behavior, showing how and why people behave a certain way in this society of ours. And they are paid handsomely for their work. I don&#8217;t know how much Brad or Jennifer get per picture, but I know that Mr. Pitt &#8211;if you average out his annual income&#8211; pulls in over a million dollars a day; Jennifer&#8217;s take is very thick gravy on their Thanksgiving Turkey.</p> \n\n<p>And speaking of &#8220;takes,&#8221; I could take or leave Jennifer, but Brad has won me over in a big way a number of times. That said, a million dollars a day is something we have to address, regardless. Not because it says anything about the Pitts being greedy. Rather, it&#8217;s something essential to confront because their collective take is peanuts in our present predicament, small fried potatoes in The American Feast. All the fuss about Oprah&#8217;s bucks and Martha&#8217;s millions notwithstanding, when it comes to the disparity in this land&#8230;which is growing each day, exacerbated worldwide&#8230;the whole lot of entertainers put together (including Michael Jordan, Madonna. Rosie et. al.) don&#8217;t amount to much when stacked up against some of NPR&#8217;s sponsors, those Corporate Behemoths.</p> \n\n<p>The greed in Mahagonny and The Threepenny Opera, Mother Courage&#8217;s sufferings, and persecution in Galileo, were all to be understood as historically specific constituents of a social environment, and dramatic presentations were intended to induce spectators to reflect on &#8220;why&#8221; these events happened, thus providing the audience with better historical understanding and knowledge.</p> \n\n<p>The intention was to produce a kind of &#8220;shock and awe,&#8221; if you will, posing questions such as: &#8220;Is that the way things are?&#8221;, &#8220;What produced this?&#8221; It&#8217;s terrible! How can we change things?&#8221; His montage of images and other techniques were designed to provoke the desire to implement radical social change. A very far cry from what the Pitts are engaged in, of course.</p> \n\n<p>Brecht&#8217;s epic theater broke with the &#8220;culinary theater&#8221; that provided each spectator with a pleasant experience or moral for easy digestion. He rejected theater that tried to produce an illusion of reality.</p> \n\n<p>Samuel Beckett hated both to talk about his work and his war time activities. He had been a courier for the French resistance, nearly caught on several occasions by the Gestapo, and later in the war he would go out with the Marquis, sabotaging German soldiers in the Vaucluse mountains. He was personally decorated by Charles de Gaulle, but would never mention it. When Jerome Lindon, a early SB publisher, was put on trial for revealing the use of torture by the French military in 50s Algeria, Beckett came to his rescue risking much personally to do the right thing. (1) From San Quentin (where he made a major contribution on behalf of the prisoners) to Saint Lo in France (where he threw caution to the wind assisting the Irish Red Cross), Beckett devoted himself to selfless acts of kindness and compassion. As a rule, his work did not address politics directly, but one could not find a greater humanitarian. Consequently, in a deeply hidden way (often), a sense of history is crucial to understanding much of Beckett. We are uprooted people, we Americans, and in Waiting for Godot Beckett underscores the amnesia that afflicts us all:</p> \n\n<p>Vladimir: At the very beginning.</p> \n\n<p>Estragon: The very beginning of WHAT?</p> \n\n<p>Vladimir: This evening&#8230;I was saying&#8230;I was saying&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Estragon: I&#8217;m not a historian. (2)</p> \n\n<p>We are forgetful and intolerant of true inquiry:</p> \n\n<p>Estragon: &#8230;.Yes, now I remember, yesterday evening we spent blathering about nothing in particular. That&#8217;s been going on for half a century.</p> \n\n<p>Vladimir: You don&#8217;t remember any fact, any circumstance?</p> \n\n<p>Estragon: Don&#8217;t torment me, Didi. (3)</p> \n\n<p>Today, we not only have historical amnesia and are forgetful, we have select concerns about what we&#8217;re willing to talk about, even within the realm of progressive issues; that goes for very involved activists/leftists too. On top of all, we have no time, and time is moving at a breakneck speed. We are all virtually, to a one, sucked dry by the syndrome Leilla Matsui and Seth Sandronsky touch upon in &#8220; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">The Passion of the Donald Getting in Touch With Your Inner Psychopath</a>&#8220;:</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Reality TV (and &#8220;The Apprentice&#8221; is no exception) reinforces the notion that &#8220;success&#8221; hinges upon one&#8217;s ability to tap into his/her inner psychopath to reap the benefits that come with a jobless recovery. On planet Reality, life imitates what kindergarten would be like if John Waters and the cast of &#8220;Pink Flamingos&#8221; were running the show. On planet earth, the Bush team has taken the farce even further with their tax cuts for the rich.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Whether or not we actually watch the nonsense, we&#8217;ve already bought into notions like pushing for &#8220;war money&#8221; to be allocated to the public school system. That&#8217;s the educational industry that brings you children volunteering to serve in the military, and parents serving as their willing cheerleaders. We push for that for the same reason, I suspect, that we push for Condoleeza Rice to testify. There&#8217;s a common denominator between the Trump fans and the traditionally trumped. There are a handful of exceptions, but, for the most part, the American public &#8211;voting and non-voting, activist and full-of-ennui others&#8211; are crippled by the notion that (on some level) they can be Brad Pitt or Jennifer Aniston, that it&#8217;s the Bush administration that&#8217;s brought about all the disparity and death, and that tuning into PBS, CNN, CBS, BBC, NPR or whatever is going to provide more than entertainment protecting the status quo. Hardly anyone is acknowledging that a complete overhaul of the system is requisite to creating the communal concerns necessary for personal prosperity, planetary survival. The 9/11 talk has descended to the level of Spectacle. What wasn&#8217;t known already? Why are people surprised? How come the partisan political aspects aren&#8217;t paramount in people&#8217;s minds? What is anyone prepared to do about all that&#8217;s on the stage that would have them behaving differently than they did during the S&amp;amp;L crisis, the Irangate scandal or the Baneful Theft of 2000?</p> \n\n<p>Entertainment, with the Greek root meaning &#8220;to hold&#8221; (attention) being primary, is what the Pitts and their colleagues and supporters are all about, whether or not some of them take an occasional foray into enlightening the public periodically. History has its place, a hit here, a huge hiatus there. Bush wants the general populace to be distracted by the likes of the Pitts, the Winfreys, the Texas Rangers and all the so-called reality shows that seem to rule the entertainment roost these days. He doesn&#8217;t begrudge them their income because they&#8217;re helping him to stay in the loop of much larger stakes. At our expense. Bush pushes the &#8220;culinary theater&#8221; that Brecht so detested, &#8220;entertainment that provides the spectator with a pleasant experience or moral for easy digestion.&#8221; His abominations in the real world are presented merely as Spectacle, and Entertainment Tonight &#8211;all of its varieties&#8211; makes sure that we don&#8217;t delve into things like the fact that on July 26, 2001, John Ashcroft had stopped flying on commercial airlines. The Attorney General, just like Janet R. before him, used to fly commercially all the time. So why, two months before Sept. 11, did he start taking chartered government planes which cost $1,600-plus per hour? Why would he choose to go G-3 Gulfstream when he could have flown the way he&#8217;d always flown for a fraction of the cost? And, perhaps most importantly, when the FBI advised Ashcroft to stay off commercial aircraft, why did the rest of us just have to take our chances? We will not go there, down that baleful burrow. We are too comfortable. We are too uncaring. We are too ignorant, stupid about our own history.</p> \n\n<p>The irreparable devestation, the sheer suffering call out for something other than mere academic debate, waiting for the Electoral Godot, our grande passion. But why not when we&#8217;ve got the Pitts with which to wile away the time? Besides we can point to Paul Newman, eyeglasses akimbo, peering out of a Nation ad advising us to bone up, Tim Robbins pontificating on the pluses of invading Afghanistan on a Donahue show, Garafalo going garrulous over grievances at gargantuan Media Reform Tour fare, and Moore/Franken selling tons of (dead tree) books. It all means about as much positive as the two cents that Ed Asner keeps kicking in whilst applauding the troops. We can still talk tears over Speilberg&#8217;s Holocaust, but we won&#8217;t allow ourselves a shred of decency respecting 9/11. All of the Show begs the question of How Who would Hold Up at the next House Un-American Committee session following a 9/11 #2, if things got bad enough. Hardly a Brecht in the bunch I&#8217;ll bet. (4) In the Irish Times of &#8217;46, Beckett touched upon the River Vire which ran through Saint Lo, highlighting the difference between the mechanical, obligatory building of civilizations and the effect on the human mind of their destruction:</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Vire will wind in other shadows unborn through the bright ways tremble and the old mind ghost-forsaken sink into its havoc.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Three hundred years from now &#8211;should we survive so long&#8211; Beckett will be remembered more for his poetry and prose than for his plays. A vision, a conception of humanity in ruins, an inkling of a different way to think about our condition once again is all available to the careful reader. And even though SB would have been horrified if Brecht had gone through with his plans to do a Marxist version of Godot, I&#8217;m sure he felt much common ground with the communist. But we can&#8217;t say the same about Ground Zero groupies and grief-stricken victims of the world&#8217;s so-called terrorists. Let me suggest what we all are likely to be remembered for, Churchill&#8217;s &#8220;little Eichmanns&#8221; and the rest of us. Recently, the new Hamas leader, Abdel-Aziz al-Rantissi asserted that &#8220;God declared war&#8221; against the United States and Israel &#8211; but stopped short of saying the group would strike U.S. targets. The Hamas chief, Abdel Aziz Rantisi, renewed threats to attack Israel in retaliation for the assassination of the group&#8217;s founder, Sheik Ahmed Yassin. Stopped short of saying that they&#8217;d strike at American targets? How can that be believed? Who can believe that? Only by people who don&#8217;t want to tear themselves away from their habitual forms of entertainment. Only by people who refuse to acknowledge what&#8217;s motivating 9/11-type terror around the globe. Only by people who have Brad as their Baedeker. I&#8217;m starting to hear strains of that old melodic Platters song, &#8220;Only You.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>I looked up &#8220;Brad&#8221; in my Celebrity Thesaurus, and I came way with &#8220;charismatic,&#8221; &#8220;talented,&#8221; &#8220;virile&#8221; and &#8220;wealthy.&#8221; The telling trouble is that many in America would make the same associations with Bush. With all that&#8217;s come down to date, at least half of those polled, about 50% of those about to vote most likely. But in looking for &#8220;the enemy&#8221; one should not dwell on Hussein, Osama or GWB. It&#8217;s the American public, not Bush nor bin Laden, my foolish fellow citizens. Beckett, Brad, Bertolt Brecht and Bush, baleful, baneful and burrow. Alliteration. It&#8217;s all so entertaining, isn&#8217;t it?</p> \n\n<p>To what end?</p> \n\n<p>(1) Proceedings were instituted against Lindon for &#8220;incitement to military disobedience.&#8221; In the U.S. we have laws on the books which would make comparable actions by citizens vis-a-vis Guantanamo, Afghanistan, Iraq or elsewhere equally dangerous&#8230;for similar reasons.</p> \n\n<p>(2) and (3): Rather than cite the exact locations of the passages above, the writer urges all readers to read or re-read Waiting for Godot, a play which has been described as the only dramatic work in theatre history in which nothing happens&#8230;twice.

It was devised in 1999, when the economy was booming, to defend Bush's right flank against Steve Forbes. During the 2000 campaign, Bush sold it as a way of returning budget surpluses to the people, with not a hint that it had something to do with fighting recession. The recession story was an after-the-fact reinvention.</p> \n\n<p>And EGTRRA didn't seem to help all that much. Formally, the recession ended in late 2001, but most labor-market indicators continued to worsen into mid-2003.</p> \n\n<p>JGTRRA, which mainly cut tax rates on capital gains and dividends, was followed by a real recovery. And the Bushies naturally claimed the credit. But the real source of the expansion was the housing boom, which had very little to do with the tax cut.</p> \n\n<p>Krugman: \"But even now real G.D.P. is considerably lower than most people thought it would be back when President Bush was selling his tax cuts.\" Krugman <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2005/10/18/the-bush-tax-cuts-and-the-deficit/\" type=\"external\">wrote</a> on October 18, 2005, that \"[w]e had a recession followed by slow growth in the early Bush years, then faster growth after that as the economy recovered. But even now real G.D.P. is considerably lower than most people thought it would be back when President Bush was selling his tax cuts.\" He added: \"At the end of the 1990's, people thought that the economy would grow at rates similar to those of the previous few years -- probably at more than 3 percent a year. In fact, economic growth since 2000 has averaged only about 2.5 percent, which is below expectations.\"</p> \n\n<p>CAP paper finds that \"supply-side policies failed to deliver what supply-side theory predicted\" regarding wage growth. As Center for American Progress' (CAP) Matthew Yglesias <a href=\"http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/2010/07/bush-tax-cuts-where-was-the-growth/\" type=\"external\">has noted</a> in response to Erickson, in a September 2008 CAP <a href=\"http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2008/09/supply_side.html\" type=\"external\">paper</a> analyzing the impact of supply-side policy, Michael Ettlinger, Vice President for Economic Policy at American Progress, and Economic Policy Institute's John Irons wrote:</p> \n\n<p>Even during the period of expansion wages were often in decline in the first supply-side period. In the second period, wages were also in decline for portions of the period, and never strong. In the post-1993 period, wages were in decline at the start but wage growth grew substantially over the period. With such dismal wage growth during supply-side periods, supply-side policies failed to deliver what supply-side theory predicted.</p> \n\n<p>CAP's report also included the following graphs based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data comparing earnings growth during the Bush, Clinton, and Reagan eras:</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>U.C.

Brooke&#8217;s pitch then was that putting pressure on Saddam Hussein was not just the right policy; it was also a vehicle for attacking Bill Clinton, then running for reelection. &#8220;I thought it was a good time to educate the Republican Congress&#8230;and give them the ammunition they needed to beat the president up.&#8221; In Scheunemann and other hardliners on the Hill, Brooke says he found kindred spirits&#8212;a clique of Republicans deeply disillusioned with how George H.W. Bush had let both the Cold War and the first Iraq War end without meting out sufficient punishment to America&#8217;s adversaries. &#8220;These people had a great sense of psychic loss that we had not finished the first Iraq War in the most comprehensive way. They hated George Bush the first.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Still, Scheunemann, who then worked for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, was initially skeptical. After he and Chalabi made their pitch, Brooke said, &#8220;Randy said, &#8216;This is all fine but on the other hand, the CIA and other parts of the US government tell me that the Iraqi opposition is a feckless bunch of people, that can&#8217;t do anything, have no support inside the country, and have probably been up to no good all over the place.'&#8221; Brooke says he encouraged Scheunemann to do his own research, and eventually convinced him.</p> \n\n<p>Go read the <a href=\"/washington_dispatch/2008/10/scheunemann.html\" type=\"external\">whole piece</a>.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "McCain\u2019s Foreign Policy Advisor and Ahmad Chalabi: How Close?", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2008/10/mccains-foreign-policy-advisor-and-ahmad-chalabi-how-close/", "published_at": "2008-10-10", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Indexes in Hong Kong, Australia both hit 10-year highs</p> \n\n<p>Asian stocks turned broadly higher by late morning Thursday, with some of October's optimism returning to markets as investors continued to buy equities.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Japanese stocks opened strong and held on to gains.

In Uganda, which he first visited in&amp;#160;2002, he has cultivated&amp;#160;ties to influential politicians and religious leaders at the forefront of the nation&#8217;s anti-gay crusade. Just before the first draft of Uganda&#8217;s anti-gay bill began circulating in April 2009, Lively traveled to Kampala and gave&amp;#160;lengthy presentations to members of Uganda&#8217;s parliament and cabinet, which&amp;#160;laid out the argument that the nation&#8217;s president and lawmakers&amp;#160;would later use to justify Uganda&#8217;s&amp;#160;draconian anti-gay crackdown&#8212;namely that Western agitators were trying to unravel Uganda&#8217;s social fabric by spreading &#8220;the disease&#8221; of homosexuality to children. &#8220;They&#8217;re looking for other people to be able to prey upon,&#8221; Lively said, according to video footage. &#8220;When they see a child that&#8217;s from a broken home it&#8217;s like they have a flashing neon sign over their head.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Lively is not the only US evangelical who has fanned the flames of anti-gay sentiment in Uganda. As they lose ground at home, where public opinion and law are rapidly shifting in favor of gay equality, religious conservatives have increasingly turned their attention to Africa. And Uganda, with its large Christian population, has been particularly fertile ground for their crusade. Journalist&amp;#160;(and past&amp;#160;Mother Jones&amp;#160;contributor)&amp;#160;Jeff&amp;#160;Sharlet&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://jeffsharlet.com/content/about-the-family/\" type=\"external\">has reported at length on the Family</a>, a politically connected US-based ministry, which promotes hard-line social policies in the East African nation.</p> \n\n<p>But, according to Ugandan gay rights activists, Lively has played an unparalleled&amp;#160;role in fostering the climate of hate that gave rise to Uganda&#8217;s anti-gay law. &#8220;The bill is essentially his creation,&#8221; says Frank&amp;#160;Mugisha, director of Sexual Minorities Uganda, a coalition of gay rights organizations.&amp;#160;Mugisha&#8217;s&amp;#160;group&amp;#160;has filed a first-of-its-kind&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://ccrjustice.org/ourcases/current-cases/sexual-minorities-uganda-v.-lively\" type=\"external\">lawsuit</a>&amp;#160;in US federal court, accusing Lively of international crimes against humanity on the grounds that he and his Ugandan allies allegedly conspired to deprive gay Ugandans of basic human rights.</p> \n\n<p>Lively, who is currently running for&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.livelyforgovernor.com/\" type=\"external\">governor of Massachusetts</a>&amp;#160;as an independent, calls the allegations &#8220;ridiculous.&#8221; &#8220;Basically, a Marxist law firm in New York City is trying to shut me up because I speak very articulately about the pro-family issues,&#8221; he says. But video obtained by&amp;#160;Mother Jones&#8212;including footage of Lively&#8217;s 2009 presentation and a little-known follow-up meeting where influential Ugandans resolved to petition parliament for a harsh new law against homosexuality&#8212;lends credence to the allegations that Lively&#8217;s fierce message paved the way for the nation&#8217;s anti-gay crackdown.</p> \n\n<p>Lively has an unusual history for a family-values crusader. A former alcoholic, he spent his late teens and&amp;#160;20s&amp;#160;drifting around the country, occasionally sleeping under bridges and begging for spare change. After finding&amp;#160;God in a Portland, Oregon, treatment center in the&amp;#160;mid-1980s, he joined a conservative evangelical church and took a job as&amp;#160;communications director for&amp;#160;the Oregon Citizens Alliance, which was loosely affiliated with the then powerful Christian Coalition and was deploying radical tactics to fight abortion and the gay rights movement. In 1992,&amp;#160;OCA&amp;#160;introduced a ballot initiative with the first faint outlines of the legislative strategy Lively would later deploy abroad. Measure 9, as it was known, barred the state government from offering any &#8220;special rights&#8221; to gays or &#8220;promoting&#8221; homosexuality. It also required public schools to treat &#8220;homosexuality, pedophilia, sadism&#8221; as&amp;#160;&#8220;abnormal, wrong, unnatural, and perverse.&#8221; &amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>The backlash was fierce. Opponents likened Lively and his colleagues to Nazis and lobbed bricks wrapped in swastika flags through the windows of businesses supporting the measure.&amp;#160;OCA&#8217;s&amp;#160;aggressive campaign, likening gays to pedophiles, was also blamed for a steep uptick in gay hate crimes. In the end, Measure 9 was defeated by a 13-point margin. Undeterred,&amp;#160;OCA&amp;#160;began promoting measures barring special protections for homosexuals on the city and county levels. Lively, who bristled at the Nazi comparisons, also threw himself into studying the Third Reich and eventually grew convinced that gay men&#8212;some of whom occupied senior posts in the Nazi regime&#8212;were the driving force behind the Holocaust. &#8220;Everything that we think about when we think about Nazis actually comes from the minds and perverted ideas of homosexuals,&#8221; he told an Oregon public access television station in 1994.&amp;#160;OCA&amp;#160;also began deploying messages reminiscent of Nazi propaganda. One&amp;#160;OCA-published&amp;#160;cartoon resembled the infamous Nazi caricature showing a Jew manipulating the strings of government and economy. As Deborah&amp;#160;Geis&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;&#8206;Steven&amp;#160;Kruger observed in their 1997 book&amp;#160;Approaching the Millennium,&amp;#160;the group&amp;#160;had merely replaced &#8220;the stooped, hooked-nose puppeteer with a fresh-faced gym boy.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>These tactics paid off:&amp;#160;OCA&amp;#160;managed to push through more than two dozen county and municipal ordinances. While the Oregon Legislature later rendered them unenforceable,&amp;#160;OCA&#8217;s&amp;#160;efforts kept the issue on the conservative agenda and showed the grassroots appeal of the group&#8217;s message. In 1994, the organization sponsored another statewide ballot initiative similar to Measure 9. It was defeated, too, but only by a 3-point margin.</p> \n\n<p>After his bare-knuckled legislative battles in Oregon, Lively retreated to California, where he earned a law degree and a Ph.D. in theology. He also became a prolific author. In 1995, he&amp;#160;coauthored&amp;#160;what would become his signature book,&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.defendthefamily.com/pfrc/books/pinkswastika/\" type=\"external\">The Pink Swastika: Homosexuality in the Nazi Party</a>. It argued that gay elements in the Nazi regime tried to wipe out the Jews because their religion condemned homosexuality. And it claimed that gays intentionally spread immorality and corruption so others were &#8220;less likely to oppose homosexuality on moral grounds.&#8221; Pornography, according to this theory, is a &#8220;tool of &#8216;gay&#8217; social engineering.&#8221; The rising rates of divorce, substance abuse, disease, and violent crime, are all a &#8220;direct consequence of embracing the &#8216;gay&#8217; ethic.&#8221; In subsequent books, Lively&amp;#160;laid out detailed tactics for battling this menace&#8212;including stressing the supposed danger homosexuality poses to young people. &#8220;Public sympathy for &#8216;gays&#8217; as victims is not grounded in logic, but in emotion,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;An effective strategy is to emphasize the issue of homosexual recruitment of children&#8230;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Lively&#8217;s ideas have proven too radical for the mainstream family values movement, but they&#8217;ve gotten some traction on the far right. Bryan Fischer, director of issues analysis for the influential American Family Association, regularly parrots his arguments linking gays to Nazis. (&#8220;Homosexuality gave us Adolph Hitler,&#8221; he opined&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.afa.net/blogs/blogpost.aspx?id=2147494882\" type=\"external\">in a 2010 post</a>&amp;#160;on the organization&#8217;s website, &#8220;and homosexuals in the military gave us the Brown Shirts, the Nazi war machine and six million dead Jews.&#8221;) Lively&#8217;s&amp;#160;theories have also&amp;#160;gained&amp;#160;currency in foreign countries, including former Soviet republics, where he has helped&amp;#160;advance anti-gay legislation. But nowhere has his influence been more keenly felt than in Uganda. During his first visit there in 2002, he spoke at an anti-pornography conference and warned participants that Western cultural Marxists, backed by liberals (such as George Soros), were trying to erode Uganda&#8217;s independence by attacking family values&#8212;a message that played on lingering colonial-era resentments. One of their core tactics, Lively argued, was deploying homosexuals to infiltrate Ugandan society. &#8220;The cultural Marxists go into these countries, they buy media and they set up these street activist organizations to recruit,&#8221; Lively tells me. &#8220;I said, &#8216;Okay, this is what&#8217;s going on here. The way to respond to that is to focus on affirming family values&#8212;and discouraging the alternatives.'&#8221; Lively, who was used to being heckled, was stunned by the positive reception he received at the gathering.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Later the same year, an influential Ugandan Assemblies of God pastor named Stephen&amp;#160;Langa&amp;#160;invited Lively and his wife, Anne, back to Kampala for a barnstorming tour. Lively met with lawmakers, lectured at universities, and gave a number of media interviews. He and&amp;#160;Langa&amp;#160;also hosted an all-day conference with local pastors. The event was closed to the media and the public, but Lively later recalled that the pastors who attended were &#8220;very grateful&#8221; for his insights &#8220;about the way in which America was brought low by homosexual activism.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Following the trip, Lively kept in contact with&amp;#160;Langa, whom he calls his &#8220;ministry partner,&#8221; and another influential&amp;#160;Ugandan pastor named Martin&amp;#160;Ssempa. Both men would ultimately be at the vanguard of Uganda&#8217;s anti-gay crackdown.</p> \n\n<p>In early&amp;#160;March 2009, Lively returned to Uganda at&amp;#160;Langa&#8217;s&amp;#160;invitation. Uganda&#8217;s High Court had recently found that the government overstepped its authority by detaining&amp;#160;two gay activists simply because they were gay. In response, a&amp;#160;Langa-run&amp;#160;group called the Family Life Network planned a three-day conference to expose what he called the &#8220;hidden and dark&#8221; gay agenda. On the last day, Lively gave a marathon five-hour presentation, which was broadcast on Ugandan television. He claimed that homosexuals were aggressively recruiting Uganda&#8217;s children and argued that human rights protections shouldn&#8217;t be extended to these &#8220;predatory&#8221; figures.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Lively also told attendees&#8212;among them Ugandan cabinet members&#8212;that the gay movement was an &#8220;evil institution&#8221; that sought to &#8220;defeat the marriage-based society&#8221; and crush anyone who stood up to its nefarious agenda. At one point, he scrawled &#8220;Causes and Types of Homosexual Dysfunction&#8221; across the top of a white board and, beneath this, drew a continuum with what he claimed were the various types of gay men. On one extreme sat the transsexuals and transvestites; on the other were what Lively called the &#8220;super machos&#8221; and &#8220;monsters.&#8221; &#8220;The Nazis were super machos,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You also see them in prisons&#8230;brutish, brutish, animalistic, men that want to hurt other people&#8230;men having sex with boys and other men, usually in some sort of aggressive way.&#8221; &amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Moving on to &#8220;the monsters,&#8221; Lively continued, &#8220;They are so far from normalcy that they&#8217;re killers. They&#8217;re serial killers, mass murderers. They&#8217;re sociopaths. There&#8217;s no mercy at all, there&#8217;s no nurturing, no caring about anybody else&#8230;This is the kind of person it takes to run a gas chamber. &#8221; He added that the genocide in neighboring Rwanda &#8220;probably involved these guys.&#8221; &amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Lively also likened homosexuality to a disease, and suggested that if Uganda didn&#8217;t &#8220;actively discourage&#8221; same-sex relations, the nation&#8217;s children might soon be throwing orgies and performing oral sex on school buses. &#8220;That&#8217;s what happens when the immune system becomes overwhelmed. The body begins to suffer, disintegrate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We need public policy that discourages homosexuality.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>According to&amp;#160;Kapya&amp;#160;Kaoma, an Anglican priest from Zambia who attended the conference as part of an investigation for the liberal think tank Political Research Associates, Lively&#8217;s remarks landed like a bombshell. &#8220;These people had never heard of anything called the gay agenda,&#8221; he recalls. &#8220;But Lively told them that these predators were coming for their children. As Africans hearing it for the first time, they believed it was true&#8212;and they were burning with rage.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>During his Ugandan trip, Lively also addressed more than 50 members of parliament. The following week, Langa&#8217;s Family Life Network convened a follow-up seminar. As attendees filtered into the meeting room, they passed a table stacked with Lively&#8217;s writings and&amp;#160;DVDs of his conference speech. The purpose of the gathering, the moderator explained, was to review the lessons from the&amp;#160;conference and &#8220;come up with a way forward.&#8221; He asked attendees to share their recollections from the previous week&#8217;s event. A stocky young man in a purple Oxford stood up. &#8220;The man of God told us about the origin of all this,&#8221; he recalled, according to video footage&amp;#160;provided by Political Research Associates. &#8220;He said there is a movement that is behind the promotion of homosexuality,&amp;#160;and it&#8217;s called &#8216;gay movement.&#8217; He told us it is more serious than we&amp;#160;have ever thought. For me, I have never heard of that. But then I got to know that there is a force behind homosexuality that we need to attack also with force.&#8221; This was followed by a flurry of incendiary claims, many of them inspired by Lively&#8217;s speech.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>By the time Langa took the stage, about an hour into the proceedings, the crowd was in a frenzy. The Ugandan pastor held up a copy of The Pink Swastika, and rehashed Lively&#8217;s inflammatory theories. In a crude variation on Lively&#8217;s take on the history of the gay movement, he claimed the first gay-rights organization in the United States was founded by&amp;#160;German-American soldier&amp;#160;named Henry Gerber, who had been stationed in pre-Nazi Germany and later became a child molester. (In reality, there is no evidence that Gerber had inappropriate relations with children).</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Langa&#8217;s speech only fed the public&#8217;s rage, and audience members rose to their feet to demand government action. Eventually, the director of research for Uganda&#8217;s parliament, Charles Tuhaise, took the floor. He argued that the problem was the nation&#8217;s&amp;#160;colonial-era anti-homosexuality laws, which made it difficult to punish gay activists. &#8220;It does not define its terms. It is totally vague and ineffective,&#8221; he explained. Tuhaise opined that parliament needed to &#8220;draft a new law that comprehensively deals with this issue&#8212;the gay agenda as we have seen it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Shortly after the meeting, attendees marched down to parliament and petitioned lawmakers to stiffen punishment for homosexuality. By late April 2009, the first d <a href=\"http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/2009/09/15/14708\" type=\"external\">raft</a> of Uganda&#8217;s anti-gay bill, authored partly by longtime Lively associate Martin Ssempa, was circulating. Its preamble echoed Lively&#8217;s arguments about the threats gays supposedly pose to society. (&#8220;Research indicates that homosexuality has a variety of negative consequences including higher incidences of violence, sexually transmitted diseases, and use of drugs&#8230;&#8221;) The bill made homosexuality punishable by life in prison, and it created a new category of offense, &#8220;aggravated homosexuality,&#8221; for repeat offenses or cases when one partner is underage or HIV positive. This was punishable by death.</p> \n\n<p>Lively claims that he never called for such harsh punishments. When Ssempa consulted him on an early draft of the legislation, he says he suggested softening the penalties and adding a provision to encourage &#8220;rehabilitation.&#8221; But by this time, the animosity he helped plant had apparently taken on a life of its own. According to correspondence that Lively reprinted&amp;#160;on his website, the Ugandan parliament rebuffed his suggestions, based largely on his own arguments about the dangers of homosexuality. &#8220;I admire the courage of my friend Dr. Lively, because he has stood up to homosexual intimidation for so long as a lone voice,&#8221; Tuhaise, the Ugandan parliament&#8217;s research director, wrote in a letter to Ssempa. But, he argued, Uganda needed the harshest possible deterrents to prevent Western gay activists from indoctrinating children and dominating the &#8220;whole culture.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>While Uganda&#8217;s parliament ultimately stripped out the death penalty, it also added harsh new provisions. Under the version of the bill that would eventually be signed into law, even touching someone of the same sex with romantic intent was a crime punishable by life in prison in certain cases. Renting a room to a homosexual or &#8220;aiding and abetting&#8221; him in any form could land a person in prison for seven years. Some US religious conservatives, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/world/africa/03uganda.html?_r=0\" type=\"external\">including Lou Engle of The Call</a>, initially appeared to laud the legislation. But most reversed course and came out against it after the deafening international outcry. Lively continued to voice tepid support. When asked by a reporter in 2010 if he would support the bill minus the&amp;#160;death penalty, he replied: &#8220;I would not have written the bill this way. But what it comes down to is a question of lesser of two evils&#8230;I think the lesser of two evils is for the bill to go through.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>As the bill inched toward passage, the situation for gay Ugandans deteriorated. Newspapers printed the names, addresses, and photos of suspected homosexuals, triggering a wave of vigilante violence. In January 2011, Sexual Minorities Uganda&#8217;s founder David Kato was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/africa/28uganda.html?_r=0\" type=\"external\">beaten to death with a hammer</a>, after his picture was splashed across the front of a Kampala tabloid, under the headline &#8220;Hang Them.&#8221; The group issued a statement blaming the murder on &#8220;hatred planted in Uganda by U.S. evangelicals in 2009.&#8221; Lively has dismissed these allegations and offered his own theory about the motive behind the murder, namely that Kato &#8220;was killed by a &#8216;gay&#8217; lover, as was the case with another homosexual activist&#8230;Carlos Castro was castrated with a corkscrew by his boyfriend and bled to death in his hotel room.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>A similar pattern has played out in other countries where Lively has promoted anti-gay legislation. In 2006, he teamed up with a politically connected Latvian pastor,&amp;#160;Alexey&amp;#160;Ledyaev, to form an international anti-gay organization called Watchmen on the Walls, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has dubbed a hate group.&amp;#160;(For more on Watchmen, see&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.boxturtlebulletin.com/\" type=\"external\">Box Turtle Bulletin</a>).&amp;#160;That summer, Lively traveled to Latvia, where he lectured at universities, met with lawmakers, and preached at&amp;#160;Ledyaev&#8217;s&amp;#160;New Generation church. As in Uganda, Lively claimed that Western activists&#8212;in this case backed by the European Union&#8212;were trying to infiltrate Latvian society and spread homosexuality, especially to children. In one case, he went as far as claiming&amp;#160;that the gay rights movement was actually seeking the right &#8220;for adult men to have sex with boys.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>During his visit, Latvia&#8217;s First Party, which has deep ties to&amp;#160;Ladyaev&#8217;s&amp;#160;church, introduced legislation barring &#8220;homosexual propaganda.&#8221; (The bill initially failed, but it was recently reintroduced). That same summer, Latvia&#8217;s lone gay rights group,&amp;#160;Mozaika, held the nation&#8217;s second gay-pride gathering. Hundreds of protestors&#8212;many of them wearing&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://hetnorm.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/riga01.jpg\" type=\"external\">T-shirts from a New Generation spin-off called &#8220;No Pride&#8221;</a>&#8212;turned out to heckle them and pelt them with eggs and feces.</p> \n\n<p>After Latvia, Lively embarked on a 50-city tour of Russia and former Soviet republics, sponsored by Ledyaev&#8217;s church, which had roughly 200 congregations and a regional TV channel. As Lively wound his way from the Baltics to Siberia, he pressed officials to outlaw the &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.defendthefamily.com/pfrc/newsarchives.php?id=2225500\" type=\"external\">public advocacy of homosexuality</a>&#8221; and agitated against anti-discrimination laws.</p> \n\n<p>Eight of the nine countries he visited eventually weighed nationwide bans on &#8220;homosexual propaganda,&#8221;&amp;#160;and five&#8212;including Russia&#8212;either have bills pending or have passed them into law. Lively takes partial credit for this development&amp;#160;and calls Russia&#8217;s controversial gay propaganda ban his &#8220;proudest accomplishment.&#8221; Some mainstream family values organizations active in the region accuse Lively of exaggerating his clout. &#8220;The influence of Scott Lively in the Russian debate is a creation of his own imagination,&#8221; Allan Carlson, president of the World Congress of Families,&amp;#160;barked&amp;#160;when an activist asked him about Lively during a Capitol Hill press conference last fall. (For more on the World Congress of Families, see &#8220; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">How US Evangelicals Helped Create Russia&#8217;s Anti-Gay Movement</a>.&#8221;)</p> \n\n<p>But activists in several Eastern European countries that Lively visited say his influence has been considerable. &#8220;To this day, Latvian politicians are using his arguments about the secret gay agenda to homosexualize society and steal the children,&#8221; says Mozaika&#8217;s executive director, Kaspars Zalitis. &#8220;Most Latvians condemn homosexuality. We believe Lively and Ledyaev are one of the main reasons for this. Every gay person in the country knows Ledyaev&#8217;s rhetoric, which he borrowed from his American friend.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>As his inflammatory ideas bear fruit abroad, Lively has renewed his attention to the home front, where he&#8217;s campaigning for&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.livelyforgovernor.com/\" type=\"external\">governor of Massachusetts</a>. He admits that it would &#8220;take a miracle from God&#8221; to land him in the governor&#8217;s mansion. &#8220;My purpose really is just to have a platform to articulate my views so people can hear them,&#8221; he explains. Lively has also partnered with another radical anti-gay crusader, Peter LaBarbera of Americans for Truth About Homosexuality, to create a new group called the Coalition for Family Values, which will work with organizations around the globe to push a hard-line anti-gay agenda. So far, Lively says, more than 75 organizations have signed on, including a few US heavyweights, such as the American Family Association.</p> \n\n<p>At a press conference announcing the group&#8217;s formation late last month, Lively praised Russia for &#8220;providing much-needed leadership in restoring family values.&#8221; When a young gay Russian man, who wore as &#8220;Lively is Deadly&#8221; button, stood up to protest, Lively drowned him out. &#8220;Every time the pro-family people come forward to speak the truth from our perspective, we are interrupted by homo fascists,&#8221; he seethed, before summoning security to drag the protestor away.</p> \n\n<p>The following week, Uganda&#8217;s president signed the nation&#8217;s draconian anti-gay bill into law, and the popular Ugandan tabloid&amp;#160;Red Pepper&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26338941\" type=\"external\">printed</a>&amp;#160;names, photographs, and home addresses of 200 alleged homosexuals, touching off a new wave of anti-gay vigilantism. Ugandan gay activists say&amp;#160;attacks and&amp;#160;harassment?&amp;#160;are becoming commonplace, with religious leaders in the Kampala suburbs calling for gays to be burned and beaten&amp;#160;over public address systems. But Lively remains unrepentant. &#8220;The gay movement has really brought this on themselves,&#8221; he&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/2014/02/27/283456094/uganda-punishing-gays-sodomy-is-not-a-human-right-says-evangelical-leader\" type=\"external\">told NPR</a>&amp;#160;during a recent interview.&amp;#160;&#8220;You know, white male homosexuals from the United States and Europe going into these African countries because the age of consent laws are low and able to take these, you know, young, teenage boys and turn them into rent boys for the price of a bicycle&#8230;When you&#8217;re taking these boys and messing with them in a culture like Uganda&#8230;they&#8217;re just asking for trouble.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Click here to read Scott Lively&#8217;s response.</a></p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Meet the American Pastor Behind Uganda\u2019s Anti-Gay Crackdown", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2014/03/scott-lively-anti-gay-law-uganda/", "published_at": "2014-03-10", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>A woman who spent six weeks in a coma is finally awake and speaking about her experience.

The driver gets out to inspect the damage to his vehicle.

Reynolds Sr., his ex-wife and son raised the money through their various charities: The Cancer Fund of America in Knoxville, Tennessee, and its affiliated Cancer Support Services; The Breast Cancer Society in Mesa, Arizona; and the Children's Cancer Fund of America in Powell, Tennessee.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>The charities hired telemarketers to collect $20 donations from people across the country, telling consumers that they provided financial aid and other support to cancer patients, including pain medication, transportation to chemotherapy visits and hospice care.</p> \n\n<p>But little money made it to cancer patients, as the groups \"operated as personal fiefdoms characterized by rampant nepotism, flagrant conflicts of interest, and excessive insider compensation\" with none of the controls used by bona fide charities, the FTC said Tuesday.</p> \n\n<p>Anyone who donated money to these groups shouldn't expect a refund anytime soon. While litigation against Reynolds Sr. and the Cancer Fund of America is ongoing, the settlement agreements with Reynolds' son, ex-wife and a long-time associate of the family - Kyle Effler - notes that much of the money has already been spent. The agreement bans the three from fundraising and shuttered their organizations.</p> \n\n<p>\"The money is mostly gone,\" said Jessica Rich, director of the FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection. Rich declined to say whether a separate criminal investigation might be underway, noting only that the regulatory agency doesn't have that authority.</p> \n\n<p>None of the groups returned phone calls and emails asking for comment. Attempts to reach family members at home by telephone were unsuccessful.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>The Breast Cancer Society, which agreed to cease operations as part of the settlement agreement, posted a lengthy statement online Tuesday attributed to its executive director - Reynolds' son, James T. Reynolds II - that blamed increased government scrutiny for the charity's downfall.</p> \n\n<p>\"While the organization, its officers and directors have not been found guilty of any allegations of wrongdoing, and the government has not proven otherwise, our board of directors has decided that it does not help those who we seek to serve, and those who remain in need, for us to engage in a highly publicized, expensive, and distracting legal battle around our fundraising practices,\" according to the statement.</p> \n\n<p>The Cancer Fund of America website previously identified Reynolds Sr. as its president and said he served in the U.S. Army Medical Corps for 12 years and attended Brigham Young University. The website went down Tuesday ahead of the FTC announcement.</p> \n\n<p>Reynolds' ex-wife, Rose Perkins, ran the Children's Cancer Fund of America. That group's website also was taken down.</p> \n\n<p>According to the complaint, the organizations hid their high administration costs from donors and regulators. The groups filed public financial documents saying they had taken in more than $223 million \"gifts in kind,\" which would be distributed to international recipients. Investigators say that number was inflated and helped to create the illusion that the groups were being more efficient with donated money than they actually were. According to the FTC, 36 states alleged that the defendants filed \"false and misleading\" financial statements with state charities.</p> \n\n<p>The settlement agreement imposed hefty judgments based on the amount of money donated to the charities between 2008 and 2012. But because of Perkins' \"inability to pay,\" her $30 million judgment would be suspended entirely. The $65.5 million judgment against Reynolds II would be suspended after he pays $75,000.</p> \n\n<p>Effler, former president of Cancer Support Services, faced a $41 million judgment that would be forgiven after paying $60,000.</p> \n\n<p>Officials on Tuesday said that any money recouped under the settlements would go to state authorities, which will have the ability to distribute the money to legitimate charities. Officials cited complexities of the case to explain why the charities were allowed to continue operating even after media outlets flagged them as potentially fraudulent.</p> \n\n<p>\"I hope it serves as a strong warning for anyone trying to exploit the kindness and generosity of others,\" Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring said of the investigation.</p> \n\n<p>The FTC recommends that when considering a donation, look for a long-standing charity with a good reputation and avoid any group that uses high-pressure tactics or is reluctant to provide detailed documentation on how the money is spent.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Follow Anne Flaherty on Twitter at https://twitter.com/annekflaherty</p>", "title": "Tennessee man, family raised $187M for cancer, then spent it on themselves", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/markets/2015/05/19/tennessee-man-family-raised-187m-for-cancer-then-spent-it-on-themselves.html", "published_at": "2016-03-09", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>When this writer was 3 years old, the Empire of Japan devastated Battleship Row of the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor.</p> \n\n<p>Before I was 7, Gen.

And tell it like it is. These are terrorists. They have declared war on my brother. (White police officers) enough is enough. How many police officers have to die trying to protect the citizens of this country. Any other president would have declared full on war on this group. Since when in our [explicit] history do we stand idle to the ambush murders of law enforcement. It has to STOP NOW,&#8221; wrote Dore.</p> \n\n<p>Dore apologized for his comments, explaining that they came out of a place of frustration following the <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/us/2016/07/18/3-law-enforcement-officers-killed-3-others-injured-in-baton-rouge-shooting.html\" type=\"external\">targeting and murder</a> of three officers in Baton Rouge--one of whom was a black man--at the hands of a black nationalist.</p> \n\n<p>Yes, his remarks were fiery, and laced with profanity, but they were also somehow construed as &#8220;racist&#8221; by members of the Jonesville community.</p> \n\n<p>After the backlash against the chief, the Jonesville Town Council asked Dore to resign. \"I think at this time Chief Dore, we will now ask you for you resign from your duties,&#8221; said Jonesville Mayor Hiram Evans, on Tuesday. &#8220;That's what I'm recommending to the board.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I'm sorry, but you should have thought about it before you even hit those keys,\" said Jonesville resident Sharon Stevenson in response to the post.</p> \n\n<p>\"It hurt. I'm going to be honest. That brought tears to me because then I saw some of the racial comments coming up,\" she added.</p> \n\n<p>The town doesn't \"need to hear [comments] like that. I can hear things and let them roll of my back, but the younger [residents], they might not be able to, and me, I don't feel safe with [Dore] being chief and making those kinds of remarks,\" she continued.</p> \n\n<p>Jonesville Councilwoman Laurie Hollins apparently \"forgives\" Dore...for voicing his opinion. She voted to oust the police chief, too.</p> \n\n<p>But some residents came to Dore&#8217;s defense: \"He's a damn good cop,\" said Bill Bullock, a man who personally knows Dore. \"He's exceptionally proficient and has good credentials.\"</p> \n\n<p>The town of Jonesville apparently takes heated opinions seriously.</p> \n\n<p>I wonder if those who hold government positions who espouse <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">hateful Black Lives Matter messaging</a> will be booted from their positions, too?

Now follow in this direction, now turn a different hue.</p> \n\n<p>&#8212; Therognis, Elegies</p> \n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the score: DJT 1, Rex Tillerson 0.&amp;#160; It would, of course, have been consistent with the calibre of other DJT appointees to have the flawed Elliott Abrams back in government. He would have fit in beautifully.&amp;#160; But for those who hoped for at least a few people of moral character to be appointed to the DJT administration, it was, at first blush, reassuring that in the DJT-Tillerson contest, DJT won.&amp;#160; It seemed that at long last (insofar as 4 weeks can be considered &#8220;long&#8221;) the integrity of a candidate that was selected to join the DJT administration mattered.&amp;#160; And the rejection of a candidate like Elliott who, the casual observer might rightfully have thought, was rejected because of his flawed character, would have been welcome news coming just as Mike Flynn, another man of deeply flawed character, was being expelled.&amp;#160; And Mike was an example of a REALLY bad appointment.</p> \n\n<p>According to <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Politico</a>, in the three months preceding the election, &amp;#160;Mike had forwarded Twitter posts that, among other things, accused Hillary Clinton of being involved in money laundering, sex crimes involving children, and of having &#8220;secretly waged war on the Catholic Church.&#8221;&amp;#160; Mike&#8217;s use of the internet to propagate lies about DJT&#8217;s opponent was, so far as DJT was concerned, no reason to not appoint him National Security Advisor.&amp;#160; It never occurred to DJT that someone he appointed of such infirm moral character might, Judas-like, turn on the very man who appointed him within a matter of days after being appointed.&amp;#160; That, of course, is exactly what Mike did when he caused the vice president of the United States to lie to the American people because Mike had lied to the vice president. &amp;#160;As a result, when the lies became public knowledge, which was several days after DJT had learned of them, DJT got rid of Mike. Those who wondered why a chronic liar had been appointed in the first place, thought that that experience might have been a wake up moment for DJT, and that he would try, in the future, to avoid appointing those with known character flaws to high positions in his muddled administration. Enter Rex Tillerson and Elliott Abrams.</p> \n\n<p>Rex Tillerson is the Secretary of State and a man uniquely unqualified to serve in that position because of his lack of experience.&amp;#160; Recognizing his own limitations, he recommended to DJT that Elliott Abrams, a man with considerable state department experience, be made his Deputy Secretary of State. Mr. Tillerson believed that having a seasoned foreign policy professional beside him, even one lacking in moral character, would serve him in good stead. &amp;#160;And Elliott had plenty in his background to demonstrate a lack of moral fiber.</p> \n\n<p>In 1991 Elliott entered a plea of guilty to two criminal charges in connection with the criminal enterprise known as the &amp;#160;Iran-Contra affair that took place under the Reagan administration.&amp;#160; He pled guilty to the charge of withholding evidence from Congress and was sentenced to probation for two years and ordered to perform 100 hours of community service.&amp;#160; In 1997, Elliott was publicly <a href=\"http://www.dcbar.org/discipline/court_action/91bg1518.PDF\" type=\"external\">censured</a> by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals for having given false testimony before congressional committees on three different occasions relating to his activities in connection with the Iran Contra affair.</p> \n\n<p>One might have thought that in considering Mr. Tillerson&#8217;s request that Elliott be appointed, DJT would have concluded that with those kinds of blemishes, DJT did not need to add to the stable of incompetents and moral cripples that he had already appointed to high positions in his administration, by selecting a flawed Elliott Abrams to be Deputy Secretary of State.&amp;#160; Had he refused to appoint him and cited those reasons in support of his decision, the people would have understood and applauded him for at long last applying strict moral standards in determining whether a proposed appointee had the qualification one might hope for in an appointee to a high governmental post.&amp;#160; It was an exciting prospect.</p> \n\n<p>The interviews with Tillerson, DJT, and Abrams, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">&amp;#160;&amp;#160;reportedly</a> went smoothly.&amp;#160; Then a funny thing happened, and Elliott was not appointed.&amp;#160; The failure to appoint him had nothing to do with Elliott&#8217;s ethical infirmities as one might have hoped. It happened because it was brought to DJT&#8217;s attention that Elliott had written unfavorably about DJT prior to the election. In one piece he wrote: &#8220;Do not allow the Republican convention to be a coronation wherein Trump and Trumpisms are unchallenged. The party needs to be reminded that there are deep divisions, and Trump needs to be reminded of how many in the party oppose and even fear his nomination.&#8221;&amp;#160; In a column for the Weekly Standard&#8221; Elliott described DJT as &#8220;someone who cannot win and should not be president of the United States.&#8221;&amp;#160; &amp;#160;When DJT was informed of Elliott&#8217;s published comments, those comments reportedly caused DJT to <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/318943-trump-rejected-abrams-as-deputy-secretary-of-state-after-he-learned\" type=\"external\">reject</a> &amp;#160;Mr. Tillerson&#8217;s request that Elliott be named the Deputy Secretary of State. The rejection had nothing to do with Abrams&#8217; character.&amp;#160; It was all about DJT&#8217;s ego.&amp;#160; A good result for the wrong reason.&amp;#160; Sort of &amp;#160;sad.</p>", "title": "Trump 1, Tillerson 0", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2017/02/17/trump-1-tillerson-0/", "published_at": "2017-02-17", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>The FBI has revealed that it has found some 30 pages of documentation concerning the Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting.</p> \n\n<p>Last year,&amp;#160;the Bureau insisted when questioned by the watchdog group Judicial Watch that it had no records relating to the June 2016 Phoenix airport meeting between former President Bill Clinton and former Attorney General Loretta Lynch.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement - story continues below</p> \n\n<p>The meeting occurred at a time when the Justice Department was investigating Hillary Clinton&#8217;s misuse of a personal server for handling classified emails.</p> \n\n<p>In August of this year, the American Center for Law and Justice, headed by attorney Jay Sekulow,&amp;#160;released emails they obtained that had been exchanged between the FBI and the Department of Justice containing information about the tarmac meeting.</p> \n\n<p>Breaking news updates and daily headlines from a news source you can trust.</p> \n\n<p>After those emails were released, the FBI acknowledged that it did in fact retain documentation concerning the controversial meeting.</p> \n\n<p>Judicial Watch, employing the Freedom of Information Act, is giving the FBI until the end of November to release the documents.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement - story continues below</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2017/10/13/fbi-finds-new-documents-about-clinton-lynch-tarmac-meeting/\" type=\"external\">The Daily Caller</a> reports:</p> \n\n<p>After the release of those documents, the FBI acknowledged that it had possession of some records related to the meeting.

United Technologies agreed to purchase Rockwell Collins for $23 billion in the biggest all-aerospace deal in history, creating a powerhouse making everything from cockpit electronics to landing gear and engines.</p> \n\n<p>Share-price moves since the deal's announcement indicate investors are putting a 70% probability on the transaction closing as planned by the third quarter of 2018. Rockwell Collins' stock on Wednesday traded around $131, below United Technologies' offer price of $140 a share in both cash and stock.</p> \n\n<p>Industry experts say Europe's antitrust watchdog represents the biggest potential obstacle to the deal. There is relatively little overlap between the two companies -- which would have combined annual aerospace revenues of $40 billion a year -- in terms of products manufactured, a primary focus of regulators in the U.S. Other countries take nontangible considerations, such as the extent of a company's dominance in a sector or segment of a supply chain, into account.</p> \n\n<p>\"If there is an issue, we expect it would be in Europe and/or China, because scope, rather than just scale, matters,\" said Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;amp; Co. analyst Doug Harned.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Experts are drawing parallels between the United Technologies-Rockwell Collins deal and the planned combination of Honeywell International Inc. and General Electric Co., which the European Commission blocked in 2001. The commission's rationale was that the deal would stifle competition.</p> \n\n<p>United Technologies Chief Executive Greg Hayes said last week that the companies don't expect antitrust problems given that there are only a \"few hundred million dollars\" in product overlap. This includes cabin interior and lighting products.</p> \n\n<p>United Technologies and Rockwell Collins may make few of the same parts, but could leverage their combined buying power to squeeze their own suppliers and demand higher prices from Airbus SE and Boeing Co., as well as airlines. Mr. Harned said this could attract the European regulator's attention.</p> \n\n<p>The deal requires approval from 17 regulators, reflecting the global nature of the aerospace industry. Each regulator has its own set of priorities.</p> \n\n<p>Attention is also on China, whose regulators are becoming a more important factor in aerospace deals. The country accounts for around 20% of Boeing and Airbus orders, and is also developing its own commercial airliners.</p> \n\n<p>Last year, Honeywell's high-profile bid for United Technologies didn't move forward, in part because United Technologies executives didn't think a deal would pass antitrust muster.</p> \n\n<p>Plane makers, concerned about the clout of a super-supplier, objected to that potential combination and already have voiced opposition to the latest one.</p> \n\n<p>Boeing quickly came out against United Technologies' proposed takeover of Rockwell Collins. \"We remain skeptical whether that's going to add value for us,\" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said at an investor conference on Wednesday.</p> \n\n<p>The world's biggest plane maker has questioned whether the deal would benefit customers and threatened to explore regulatory options and review existing contracts with the two companies. Boeing plans to examine whether the deal is inconsistent with \"the long-term health and competitiveness of the aerospace industry supply chain.\"</p> \n\n<p>Airbus and Boeing are pressuring suppliers to cut costs, manufacturing more parts in house and chasing the lucrative repair business. That is encouraging deal making among smaller firms.</p> \n\n<p>Industry experts said the purchase of Rockwell Collins -- if approved by antitrust officials -- could trigger a round of deals among larger companies that could help spur the creation of a counterweight to Airbus and Boeing.</p> \n\n<p>\"I think this will be the start of more consolidation,\" said David Gale, head of North American industrial mergers and acquisitions at Ernst &amp;amp; Young LLP. \"It's going to force others to broaden their products and services.\"</p> \n\n<p>The number of transactions in the sector has already climbed over the past two years. More than 100 aerospace and defense deals were tracked in three of the past four quarters, according to Janes Capital Partners LLP. Deals numbered around 70 a quarter over the prior two years.</p> \n\n<p>\"The two groups forming in front of us are [United Technologies] and Honeywell,\" said Lou Peluso, a consultant at AlixPartners LLP. \"They're going to start sucking up stuff.

While there are no guarantees in the market, as long as the rules of the game remain fairly consistent, you'll have a strong framework to follow to help you accomplish your goals.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Every once in a while, though, either milestones get passed, long-term trends reach tipping points, or the rules of the game change. 2017 is no different on that front, which means that both opportunities and risks are facing you as you plan your retirement this year. Read on for three bold predictions of things to come throughout the rest of the year.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Getty Images.</p> \n\n<p>Thanks to inflation adjustments over time, the amount you can contribute to your retirement plans has increased. In 2017, if you're under age 50, you can contribute up to $5,500 to an IRA and $18,000 to an employer-sponsored plan like a 401(k). That's $23,500 that can be socked away in tax-advantaged plan. If that money compounds at 9% annually -- about in line with the stock market's historical long run returns-- it will become $1.04 million in 44 years.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>This means that, if you're fresh out of college and able to come up with that kind of money, you can potentially become a millionaire by retirement from that one year's contribution. It's a challenge for anyone to come up with that kind of cash, and it's particularly tough for a new hire just starting out in life. Consider it a bold challenge for seniors getting ready to graduate -- and an opportunity to jump-start your financial life.</p> \n\n<p>President Trump campaigned on preserving Social Security through economic growth rather than via direct spending, or tax changes affecting the program. Whether or not that will remain his plan in the future, the reality is that the various bills currently being tossed around Congress currently have very little chance of becoming law this year.</p> \n\n<p>History -- <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/11/07/the-2016-social-security-crisis-was-temporarily-av.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">even as recently as late 2015 Opens a New Window.</a>, when the most recent patch made it through the system -- suggests that Social Security's standing as the \"Third Rail\" of American politics remains intact. Proposed changes that either cut or reduce the rate of growth of the program are frequently greeted with charges of \"throwing granny off the cliff.\" Changes that increase taxes are decried as economically destructive.</p> \n\n<p>The net result is that any reform ideas -- even good ones -- typically can't get traction until the only alternative is the massive benefit cuts that come from the trust funds emptying. Then, and only then, will lawmakers be likely to find both the courage and willingness to compromise to patch it again.</p> \n\n<p>Unfortunately, this means that Social Security's trust funds will remain on track to run out of money around 2034, slashing benefits for all recipients by more than 20%. As a result, as you plan for retirement, you should consider the risks of either that kind of reduction in Social Security, or the potential of an equivalent tax hike to cover its costs. Invest accordingly, and you should still have enough time to make up for the implications of that coming shortfall -- or the patches to try to hold it together.</p> \n\n<p>Much digital ink has been spilled about how baby boomers are now reaching retirement age at the rate of around 10,000 per day. But just because they may be retirement eligible doesn't mean they're retirement ready. Indeed, a 2016 survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers indicated that 43% of boomers would be not be able to meet their basic expenses if they were unemployed for an extended period of time.</p> \n\n<p>And what is retirement, other than an extended period of unemployment? Granted, it's one with potential benefits from Social Security, Medicare, and perhaps from a benevolent former employer, but those only go so far. If nearly half of boomers -- those nearing or perhaps even past a traditional retirement age -- can't make basic ends meet without a job, they'll likely either want to hold on to the ones they have, or pick up some type of paycheck in retirement.</p> \n\n<p>The good news is that, with many of those aging boomers continuing to work, the economy will benefit from their wages. The not-so-good news is that the Generation X'ers who come behind them may have to wait a bit longer for the leadership spots they hope to step into as those boomers eventually retire.</p> \n\n<p>While these predictions may very well come to pass, you should still have the opportunity to continue following your retirement savings plan. None of these reasons look likely to restrict your ability to fund your accounts. They may give you reasons to consider making small adjustments, but that's all part of the long-term process of successfully getting you to, and through, your retirement.</p> \n\n<p>The $15,834 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $15,834 more... each year! Once you learn how to maximize your Social Security benefits, we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after. <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/mms/mark/ecap-foolcom-social-security?aid=8727&amp;amp;source=irreditxt0000002&amp;amp;ftm_cam=ryr-ss-intro-report&amp;amp;ftm_pit=3186&amp;amp;ftm_veh=article_pitch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Simply click here to discover how to learn more about these strategies Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFBigFrog/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Chuck Saletta Opens a New Window.</a> has no position in any stocks mentioned.

Having returned along with other leftist democrats in November 1987, Zamora is now embarked on the risky and complicated task of organizing a popular, democratic, civil movement.

Most of the gains came following the release of the Federal Reserve's latest minutes from its June Open Market Committee meeting, at which officials discussed the possibility of implement interest rate increases more quickly than many had expected. Yet after some initial shock at the idea of a more hawkish rate policy, investors seemed to decide that the Fed likely would choose not to be as aggressive as the minutes suggested, and stocks erased early losses as a result. Some individual stocks posted even stronger gains, and Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ: CZR), Och-Ziff Capital Management (NYSE: OZM), and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE: VRX) all enjoyed substantial increases for the day.</p> \n\n<p>Caesars Entertainment rose 6% after the casino company announced that it and its subsidiaries had entered into a settlement and forbearance agreement with one of its bondholders. The deal with investor Frederick Barton Danner, who has a position in senior notes issued by Caesars' operating company subsidiary that are due this year, includes several provisions that are favorable to Caesars. They include support for the restructuring of debt under the bankruptcy reorganization plan, support for motions to protect Caesars Entertainment from liability, and forbearance from pursuing any default rights against the companies. Caesars has offered incentives to bondholders to accept the deal, and the settlement with one of the lead plaintiffs against it should carry some weight in resolving the broader issue going forward.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Och-Ziff Capital Management climbed 6% in the wake of charges against a man from the African nation of Gabon alleging that he participated in a scheme to bribe government officials in exchange for rights to mining claims. The man worked for a business entity linked to Och-Ziff, which has already engaged in discussions with U.S. officials regarding any potential liability under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Investors became more comfortable throughout the day that Och-Ziff might avoid any further culpability linked to the charges, and that helped send the stock higher. The hedge fund manager will likely still have to work with Justice Department officials in order to resolve the matter, but anything that avoids criminal charges against Och-Ziff would be a clear positive.</p> \n\n<p>Finally, Valeant Pharmaceuticals picked up 13%. The beleaguered drugmaker got an upgrade from analysts at Morgan Stanley, who argued that most of the concerns against Valeant are already accounted for in its low share price. In particular, the analysts went through issues like earnings declines, violations of debt covenants, changes in drug-pricing practices, and the possibility of investigations and financial restatements. Yet even though the chances of adverse outcomes are greater than zero, Morgan Stanley still thinks that the stock deserves an overweight rating based on valuation. A lot depends on how Valeant fares in the court of public opinion, but the stock's huge hit certain discounts at least some bad news.</p> \n\n<p>A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Who were those engaging in force at Ruby Ridge, Waco and the Bundy Ranch? It was not the militia. It was the US government, via the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and the <a href=\"http://freedomoutpost.com/2014/04/ron-paul-warned-armed-blm-1997/\" type=\"external\">BLM</a>, <a href=\"http://gunsinthenews.com/atf-no-constitutional-authority-ban-ammunition/\" type=\"external\">both of which are unconstitutional</a>.

It was not the militia that <a href=\"http://freedomoutpost.com/2014/04/faa-establishes-fly-zone-cliven-bundy-ranch/\" type=\"external\">instituted a no-fly zone over the ranch</a>. It was not the militia that preemptively positioned an <a href=\"http://freedomoutpost.com/2014/04/obama-admin-sends-hundreds-armed-feds-harass-cliven-bundy-wouldnt-send-1-soldier-defend-benghazi/\" type=\"external\">army of federal agents</a> around the Bundys, <a href=\"http://freedomoutpost.com/2014/04/concerned-citizen-moapa-valley-town-board-meeting-bundy-ranch-seige-blm-will-fire-next-shot-heard-around-world-will-fire-rest/\" type=\"external\">including snipers</a>.</p> \n\n<p>The same is true regarding what is <a href=\"http://thewashingtonstandard.com/bigger-than-bundy-ranch-militia-put-on-level-2-alert-to-defend-oregon-ranchers-against-tyrannical-feds-who-label-them-terrorists/\" type=\"external\">taking place currently in Oregon with the Hammond family</a>. Members of their family are basically enduring Double Jeopardy, something that is not supposed to be happening under the protections of the Fifth Amendment, which states in part, &#8220;Nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .&#8221; <a href=\"http://thewashingtonstandard.com/oregon-rancher-fears-for-his-life-after-feds-threaten-him-through-his-attorney/\" type=\"external\">They have been threatened by the federal government</a> for speaking out to Ammon Bundy, <a href=\"http://thewashingtonstandard.com/ammon-bundy-issues-resolution-to-local-officials-regarding-oregon-ranchers-we-dont-have-to-remind-you-of-your-duty-to-act-nor-consequences-of-negligence/\" type=\"external\">who has been airing what is taking place and the injustices surrounding the issue</a>. In fact, the <a href=\"http://thewashingtonstandard.com/blm-burns-ranches-and-destroy-cattle-but-ranchers-get-charged-with-terrorism/\" type=\"external\">BLM has engaged in worse activity than the men of the Hammond family engaged in and yet, even with video evidence</a>, they are not held accountable in a similar manner to <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">the Hammonds</a>.

Among them are former Marines Schuyler Barbeau and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Pete Santilli</a>. Barbeau has been in jail and under investigation for suspected firearms violations (something that is repugnant to the Second Amendment of the Constitution and, therefore, null and void (Marbury vs.Madison, 1803.)) as well as other claims by the FBI. Santilli was recently <a href=\"http://thewashingtonstandard.com/exclusive-former-us-marine-put-on-terror-watch-list-held-at-gunpoint-was-it-because-he-is-helping-the-oregon-ranchers/\" type=\"external\">targeted in Ohio and was said to be on the Terror Watchlist</a> just days before he was to head out West to aid both Barbeau and the Hammond family. Currently, he too is facing an alleged gun violation that is in violation of the Second Amendment.</p> \n\n<p>There is no doubt in my mind that Barbeau was targeted for his involvement with the Bundy Ranch and that Santilli was targeted for his ties to Barbeau, but neither have actually committed a crime or engaged in terrorism. The charges are made against both men through pretended legislation that undermines the clear statements of the rights of both men.</p> \n\n<p>We know this administration has taken steps to <a href=\"http://freedomoutpost.com/2013/09/official-government-documents-label-72-types-americans-potential-terrorists/\" type=\"external\">label 72 types of loyal, patriots and law-abiding citizens as potential terrorists</a>.

The debate is said to include a wide-range of opinion, but even at the top political and military levels, there isn&#8217;t profound understanding of insurgencies in general or the particular dynamics of the Afghan one.</p> \n\n<p>The Afghan insurgency, we are repeatedly told, is based on intimidation and violence. This is true in parts of the country, but dubious in others. Indeed, seeing any insurgency as resting mainly on force is wrong and it will lead to wrong responses. Insurgencies develop when a non-government group builds rapport with at least parts of the populace. This was the case in Malaya, the Philippines, Algeria, and South Vietnam. And it is the case in Afghanistan.</p> \n\n<p>Consider a few patterns:</p> \n\n<p>Pashtun elders meet with western officers and accept development programs, yet too often they make only desultory efforts to fight insurgents. This is clear from numerous small engagements and glaringly so from attacks conducted by sizable insurgent forces such as those who assaulted US positions in Nuristan recently and in Kunar last year. Tribes are, among other things, intelligence networks, keeping watch and ward over their lands for trespassers, bandits, and enemies. The coalescence and deployment of large insurgent forces could not have gone undetected by herdsmen, traders, or hunters who traverse the district and report to elders. Something is amiss here.</p> \n\n<p>The Pashtun tribes are vaunted warriors who repelled the Russians, British, Persians, and numerous lesser-known powers unwise enough to venture into their lands. Yet these same tribesmen are said to bow before a band of lightly-armed guerrillas. Elders have the authority, weapons, fighters, and local knowledge to mount formidable resistance, but they elect not to. Why is this?</p> \n\n<p>The spread of the insurgency in recent years, according to many observers with local knowledge, is often based more on negotiation than on force. Insurgents cannot match the resources of western powers, but they are able to win local support in other ways. Taliban figures settle disputes in accordance with Islamic law, stand as opponents of northern/Tajik dominance, offer the prospect of fairer government, listen to local needs without the western assumption of superior knowledge, fight without the use of massive firepower, and represent the promise of restored Pashtun greatness. Most critically, they present themselves as an enduring, indigenous power adamantly opposed to the presence of transient, foreign ones.</p> \n\n<p>The insurgents are more adept at negotiations and assurances than are the Kabul government or the western powers. Kabul&#8217;s preference for aggrandizement and the US&#8217;s ignorance of counterinsurgency have allowed the insurgents to win over large numbers of Pashtun people in the South and East. They have even been able to gain support from a few non-Pashtun groups in the North and West, in part by presenting them as an alternative to the foreigners who have overstayed whatever welcome they once had. An insurgency is in ways a debate, and thus far the insurgents&#8217; arguments are more convincing. Pashtun elders vote with their sons by attaching local men to serve in the insurgent bands, which has helped the Taliban triple in size over the last two years.</p> \n\n<p>What then of the troop surge in a country with an insurgency more entrenched than thought? More western troops in contested regions will almost certainly strengthen local beliefs and insurgent claims that US and NATO forces are another occupying force &#8211; a belief paradoxically supported by western assurances that they will stay on until the insurgents are defeated. More troops will step up the fighting, which will further alienate the support of locals who see westerners, not insurgents, as the cause of widespread destruction.</p> \n\n<p>Several other questions must be central to the debate in Washington. Will the insurgents&#8217; numbers and experience require far more western forces? Have the insurgents already consolidated in large parts of the country such that counterinsurgency is not feasible or will take a decade or more to work? Is the US public likely to support the war for another decade? What of European publics? Perhaps most importantly, can more US troops make up for the ineptitude and corruption of the Afghan army and state without becoming an occupying power?</p> \n\n<p>BRIAN M.

There was singing, dancing, the firing of guns into the air, families strolling together to the polling stations. Palestinian women&#8217;s organizations had spent weeks encouraging women to vote, and many women did show up for their first election, especially in urban centers. While not all checkpoints were eased and not all Palestinians wanted to vote under an occupation regime, the overall climate was one of hope and a new beginning.</p> \n\n<p>Voting day in Jerusalem, on the other hand, was marked by a flawed process. The Israeli government could not prevent Jerusalem&#8217;s Palestinian residents from participating in the elections, but it wanted to avoid the appearance of Jerusalem being part of the Palestinian Authority. Therefore, the authorities designed a voting system that was a pearl of Talmudical caginess, allowing for the vote, but giving it the appearance of an absentee ballot being cast in Jerusalem for sending to a Palestinian state that was &#8220;somewhere else&#8221;. Therefore, voting was carried out only in post offices, where marked ballots were handed to postal clerks who inserted them into special mailboxes, presumably to be &#8220;mailed&#8221; to Palestine. Special attention was given to the location of the slot. The Israeli authorities felt strongly that a slot on the top of the box would give the appearance of a real ballot box. Therefore, these mailboxes had slots on the side. Here&#8217;s a photo (left) I took of a man at one of these red mail-ballot-boxes, behind a glass pane and inaccessible to the voter. Note also the lack of privacy, with the clerk looking on as he leans on the counter marking his ballot, and the next voter edging closer. Worst of all, only 6,000 Jerusalemites out of 125,000 were allowed to vote in town, with the rest dispatched to voting stations out of town, to which access through checkpoints was eased, but still not easy.</p> \n\n<p>Under these conditions, many Palestinians in Jerusalem refused to vote. And many were afraid to vote, in fear that Israel would regard that as grounds for canceling their Jerusalem residency rights. It&#8217;s no wonder that a Palestinian woman carrying a bunch of bananas stood outside the main post office on the Palestinian side of Jerusalem, handing out flyers that called Israel a &#8220;banana republic democracy&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>I too wanted to see the excitement on the other side of town, so I answered the call of Bat Shalom, a women&#8217;s peace organization, to help keep the extremist Israeli right from carrying out their threat to disrupt the proceedings. As six of us walked together toward the Palestinian side of Jerusalem, an Israeli police officer stopped us, said he knew of our plan, and that our presence would &#8220;provoke counter-demonstrations&#8221;. We argued for a while, and then he announced we were under arrest, to prevent us from &#8216;disturbing the peace&#8217;. We were shocked, but a moment later he was distracted by a phone call, so we simply slipped away and melted into the side streets, splitting up so we would be less obvious if he sent a posse. One would think the police had better villains to worry about.</p> \n\n<p>Despite the many difficulties and Israel&#8217;s grudging cooperation, the vote did take place, leaving many Palestinians and even Israelis with a sense of elation. A real election was held &#173; with real competition and no mud slinging &#173; and the candidate who consistently called for an end to the violence and negotiation of a real peace was swept into power with 62% of the vote. Now the proverbial ball is in Israel&#8217;s court, and the excuse for not negotiating is long dead and buried.</p> \n\n<p>Other good news</p> \n\n<p>24 hours later and on the Jewish side of town, the new Israeli government &#173; comprising Likud, Labor, and United Torah Judaism, an ultra-Orthodox party &#173; was sworn in, thanks to Sharon&#8217;s wily brinkmanship with the extremists from his own party who oppose the disengagement from Gaza. The government will now have the parliamentary strength it needs to get out of Gaza, and Shimon Peres is back in power, defying age, wisdom, and public incredulity.</p> \n\n<p>And the anti-evacuation settlers are digging their own graves. Once considered the last of the idealists, support for the settler movement has plummeted among Israelis in the wake of recurring violent clashes with Israeli soldiers evacuating settler outposts. Today, the settlers are regarded as the anti-democratic, lunatic fringe. In truth, the vast majority of settlers are far more moderate, and would leave the territories in a heartbeat for the price of their property, but the fanatics are now setting the tone and image.</p> \n\n<p>By the way, in a small meeting this evening where former US President Jimmy Carter, chief election observer in the Middle East, spoke to the participants of the Ecumenical Accompaniment Program (which I was lucky to have attended), this honorable man berated people for using the term &#8220;fence&#8221;. Said Jimmy, &#8220;Israel has successfully convinced the United States that this is an innocuous fence, as if it were a fence around a cow pasture, but this is really a dividing wall and we should refer to it as suchThis wall is one of the most vivid vulnerabilities of Prime Minister Sharon&#8217;s policies.&#8221; Bravo, Mr. Carter, for more plain talk.</p> \n\n<p>Monday was also a red letter day for supporters of human rights, as Israel&#8217;s High Court ruled that lesbian couples may now officially adopt each other&#8217;s children. We are all grateful to Tal and Avital Yaros-Hakak, who sacrificed their privacy to establish this important precedent.</p> \n\n<p>Finally, the tragedy in the Indian Ocean, and it takes a religious extremist to have figured it out: A Muslim cleric announced that the Zionists caused the Tsunami. This was practically confirmed by a rabbi in Israel, who announced that God doesn&#8217;t like non-Jews, and that&#8217;s why he dropped all this water on them. Jewish-Muslim consensus, at last, helping us understand the mystery of God&#8217;s ways.</p> \n\n<p>GILA SVIRSKY is a peace and human rights activist in Jerusalem.

His <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=th-D-yPm0VM\" type=\"external\">assertion</a> that the over-the-top show of force by Ferguson police &#8221; doesn&#8217;t make any sense&#8221; was a reasonable assessment&amp;#160; for anyone watching the live coverage.</p> \n\n<p>It didn&#8217;t last long.</p> \n\n<p>CNN, whose headquarters in Atlanta were the site of <a href=\"http://twitchy.com/2014/08/18/what-are-they-protesting-large-crowd-rallies-outside-cnn-headquarters/\" type=\"external\">protests</a> related to the police killing of Michael Brown and the images the network uses of black victims, was ushered from the streets by police as they moved in on the remaining protesters later on through the night. Tapper, now joined by Don &#8220;Pull Your Pants Up&#8221; Lemon, did manage to speak to Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol after an awkward on-air phone conversation, where they asked him to meet him &#8220;next to the tank.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Lemon, one of media&#8217;s most vocal proponents of &#8220;responsibility politics&#8221; (Extra!, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">11/13</a>), asked Johnson what was &#8220;bothering&#8221; him&#8211;as the conversation moved from one of journalists questioning officials, to one with a markedly more personal and empathetic tone. Johnson proceeded to give the predictable police side of the story that is par for the course with protest coverage. He also admonished Tapper and Lemon for their&#8230;well, journalism. Johnson didn&#8217;t think Ferguson police were getting positive enough coverage, so he asked Tapper and Lemon to join him the next day and report alongside him.</p> \n\n<p>They eagerly agreed.</p> \n\n<p>In a matter of minutes, members of the media, who had been objectively and effectively reporting on a protest greeted with a&amp;#160; militarized crackdown worthy of a war-torn country, suddenly agreed to become embedded journalists&#8211;just like in a war-torn country. Embedded journalism, as FAIR has often written (e.g, Extra!, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">9/03</a>), is one of the worst practices of media if you want independent and accurate reporting.</p> \n\n<p>The next day, in a much less tense environment, Johnson continued to make his case as he spoke with Lemon (CNN, 8/19/14) that police were &#8220;getting a bad rap&#8221; by the media.</p> \n\n<p>I guess no one should be that surprised. These moments of actual journalism where the plight of communities of color is taken into account are the exception and not the rule with corporate media.</p>", "title": "CNN Attempts Actual Journalism\u2013But Reverts to Embedded Reporting", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://fair.org/blog/2014/08/19/cnn-attempts-actual-journalism-but-reverts-to-embedded-reporting/", "published_at": "2014-08-19", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Stocks ticked higher last week as first-quarter earnings season began.

Netflix's profit margin nearly doubled, just as management predicted, as an improving content slate allowed the company to raise prices without sacrificing user gains.</p> \n\n<p>CEO Reed Hastings and his team have predicted that this positive momentum will continue into 2018, with subscriber growth forecast to accelerate to about 6.35 million this quarter from 4.95 million in the year-ago period. New content releases and growth in international markets will be the main drivers behind those gains. And if streamers continue to binge these original series, then investors can expect Netflix to keep spending heavily to keep that pipeline of new content as full as possible.</p> \n\n<p>Healthcare titan Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson will announce its results before the market opens on Tuesday. Investors are optimistic that both sales and profits will increase at a robust pace this quarter. After all, the blue chip was able to overcome falling sales of its core Remicade drug last year to post a 6% increase in organic revenue. Each of its three massive business lines -- consumer products, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices -- expanded in 2017.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson has <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/03/14/forget-remicade-heres-how-johnson-johnson-plans-to.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;referring_guid=30af9ee5-66e0-4862-bf05-799d8e2d40c9&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">many more drugs in development Opens a New Window.</a> that will help pick up the slack in its Remicade declines this year. Investors should look for CEO Alex Gorsky and his team to discuss that pipeline on Tuesday while also highlighting the company's stellar cash flow.</p> \n\n<p>As for its latest operating forecast, the outlook calls for a growth slowdown in 2018 to between 3.5% and 4.5%. But management might tweak that prediction on Tuesday. Earnings, on the other hand, are expected to rise by as much as 9.6% for the full year to $8.20 per share.</p> \n\n<p>Procter &amp;amp; Gamble's stock has had an unusually weak run over the past five years, underperforming the market by nearly 50 percentage points. That's because while sales growth has accelerated in each of the last two fiscal years and profitability is reaching new highs, the consumer products giant has lost market share across key franchises like Gillette.</p> \n\n<p>Investors voiced their displeasure about these trends by voting to elect activist shareholder Nelson Peltz to the board of directors. This Friday's earnings report will be the first one since the new board was seated, and so it might include the articulation of a strategic shift.</p> \n\n<p>But the pressure to make aggressive changes will be greater if sales growth disappoints.

Its giant warehouses are only open to members who pay $55 a year for the privilege of shopping at its bargain-priced, bare-bones depots.</p> \n\n<p>Thanks to its membership model, Costco has become the #2 retailer in the country, with 2015 revenue of $113.6 billion. Membership fees contributed $2.53 billion in its most recent fiscal year, or just 2.2% of its total revenue; however, the power of its membership model goes well beyond the top-line fees it generates.</p> \n\n<p>Costco has one of the most dependable customer bases in retail. Its membership renewal rate was 91% in the U.S. and Canada last year and 88% globally. Those members spend about $2,500 on average.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Costco offers individual and business memberships for $55, and executive memberships, which come with additional benefits such as 2% cash back, for $110. It closed last year with 34 million individual members and 10.6 million business members. 39% of cardholders are executive members, up from 38% the year before, and executive members spend more than regular members, making up two thirds of sales, a trend that should help profitability in the future.</p> \n\n<p>The most important factor about membership fees is that they go straight to the company's bottom lines. Costco operates its warehouses on essentially a breakeven basis, making its profits on memberships instead of merchandise. Last year, for example, net income was $2.38 billion, just shy of the $2.53 billion it brought in in membership fees.</p> \n\n<p>Costco's bargain-basement prices are also visible in other parts of its financial reports. The company's gross margin, or the percentage of its sales it keeps after accounting for direct costs like the cost of products, labor, and occupancy, was just 11.1%. By comparison, low-priced rivals likeAmazon.comandWal-Marthave much largers gross margins than Costco. Amazon's is 34.4% and Wal-Mart's is 25.3%, illustrating the uniqueness of Costco's model.</p> \n\n<p>The membership fee also incentivizes Costco customers to spend more at its stores and increase the frequency of their visits to take advantage of their memberships. Amazon has found similar success with Prime, its own membership program.</p> \n\n<p>Unlike Amazon, however, Costco's entire business model is built on memberships. Costco considers membership loyalty and growth to be \"essential to our business model.\"</p> \n\n<p>The company's best strategy for driving profits higher may be to sell more executive memberships. At $110 a pop, those memberships bring in twice the revenue of standard Gold Star memberships, and encourage customers to spend more.</p> \n\n<p>One additional benefit of the membership model may be that the attractiveness of Costco's low prices means it doesn't need the same store footprint as Wal-Mart, which has blanketed the country with Supercenters. Costco's advantage can be seen in the fact that its stores generate double the sales per square foot that Wal-Mart's do.</p> \n\n<p>For now, Costco's membership model seems solid, with a North American renewal rate of 91%, but the rise of e-commerce could present a threat. The company has resisted basic features like in-store pick-up, as management wants to drive traffic through the store rather than encourage a trip to a single counter -- but as Amazon Prime continues to gain in popularity, it could present a threat to Costco.</p> \n\n<p>Going forward, membership renewal rates and fee growth will continue to offer a window into the company's future. If renewal rates begin to slide, Costco may have to rethink its value proposition.</p> \n\n<p>A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

More than two decades after he was gunned down, his vast wealth, megalomania and ruthless violence still mesmerize, as evidenced by the attention surrounding Netflix's upcoming series \"Narcos\" about the cartel boss.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>The biopic promises to be an authentic portrayal of Escobar, so it's only natural that Brazilian director and executive producer Jose Padilha chose to film the 10-episode series in Medellin, the murder capital of the world during the drug kingpin's heyday in the 1980s.</p> \n\n<p>Filming the series here would have been unthinkable a few years ago, with Colombians still blaming Escobar for their country's hard-to-shake association with drug trafficking. But as memories of Escobar's terror campaign fade, and with the homicide rate at a decade low, Colombians are starting to view their violent past more dispassionately. So much so that cinema-loving President Juan Manuel Santos agreed to pick up $2 million in production costs so Netflix could film in the country.</p> \n\n<p>The series, which debuts Aug. 28, is based on the account of Steve Murphy and Javier Pena, now retired Drug Enforcement Administration agents who were assigned to bring the drug lord down. It's one of several projects reviving interest in the man known as the \"King of Cocaine,\" including last year's film \"Escobar: Paradise Lost,\" starring Benicio del Toro. At least two more movies about Escobar are in development.</p> \n\n<p>Because of the lingering sensitivities about the bad reputation Escobar gave Colombia, Netflix executives and Padilha flew to Bogota last year to meet with Santos before filming.</p> \n\n<p>The president, whose family brought the Cinemark movie chain to Colombia, immediately embraced the project, said Claudia Triana, head of the state-funded Proimagenes film promotion agency. But Santos urged Padilha not to romanticize a criminal who promoted himself as a Colombian Robin Hood despite ordering thousands of people killed, from presidential candidates to passengers on a commercial jetliner he had blown up.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Triana said that no matter where the series was made it would have presented the same image of Colombia, so it was preferable to have it filmed here to make foreign members of the cast and crew more sensitive to the toll Escobar's bloodbath had on society.</p> \n\n<p>Netflix, with local production partner Dynamo, got the big subsidy to film under an initiative Santos' government launched in 2013 to market Colombia as South America's premier shooting location. The administration pays for up to 40 percent of filming costs to foreign producers who hire local crews and spend at least $600,000 in the country.</p> \n\n<p>While some officials feared the series would portray the country negatively, Triana said resistance to filmed depictions of Colombia's violent history has eased in part because of wildly popular soap operas known as \"narconovelas\" that present an unvarnished view of the drug wars.</p> \n\n<p>Still, Congressman Rodrigo Lara said he's skeptical that Colombia's complex history can be accurately rendered in a series whose trailer teases audiences in English: \"There's No Business Like Blow Business,\" using a slang word for cocaine.</p> \n\n<p>\"When you take real events and convert them into several episodes for a TV series, the need to entertain and keep the audience hooked is always going to predominate,\" said Lara, whose father, a justice minister, was slain by Escobar's hit men in 1984.</p> \n\n<p>Escobar's son, who changed his name to Sebastian Marroquin and moved to Argentina after his father's death, also questions how accurate the Netflix depiction will be.</p> \n\n<p>\"I'm not very convinced by stories sold as truthful that use my father's name without authorization and purposefully ignore the main keepers of his memories: his family,\" Marroquin told The Associated Press in an email. He is the author of a book and documentary about his relationship with his father.</p> \n\n<p>Pena and Murphy, who were technical consultants for the series, said Padilha and the actors worked hard to provide an accurate look at what was then the world's largest manhunt. Brazilian actor Wagner Moura, who stars as Escobar, studied Spanish in Medellin to approach the capo's thick regional accent. Pedro Pascal and Boyd Holbrook, who play Pena and Murphy, embedded with real-life anti-narcotics agents at the DEA's academy in Quantico, Virginia.</p> \n\n<p>Murphy said they also wanted to make sure the countless heroes among Colombia's police got \"credit for the work they did and the risks they took.\" He proudly visited the set in Bogota with his wife and the two Colombian-born daughters they adopted when they lived here.</p> \n\n<p>Huge quantities of cocaine still flow out of Colombia and violence continues at chronically high levels. Last year's homicide rate, while the lowest in a decade, was still almost six times that of the U.S.</p> \n\n<p>But the possibility of Colombia becoming a narco state, a real threat during Escobar's time, has lifted, said Medellin writer Hector Abad Faciolince, allowing Colombians to view the drug trade more objectively.</p> \n\n<p>\"A few years ago we Colombians were overzealous when it came to displaying our sores, our vices and our wounds,\" said Faciolince, whose father, a human rights activist, was killed by right-wing paramilitaries during an especially violent period that coincided with Escobar's reign. \"Now we handle it better because it seems that the worst is behind us.\"</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Joshua Goodman on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjoshgoodman</p>", "title": "As memories of Pablo Escobar's terror fade, Colombians embrace Netflix biopic 'Narcos'", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/markets/2015/08/19/as-memories-pablo-escobar-terror-fade-colombians-embrace-netflix-biopic-narcos.html", "published_at": "2017-01-02", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Former-&#8220;Anonymous&#8221;-hactivist-turned-FBI-informant Hector Xavier Monsegur, aka &#8220;Sabu,&#8221; has turned to the news media to defend himself against accusations of &#8220;snitching&#8221; on his colleagues.</p> \n\n<p>In a revealing interview that aired Tuesday with Charlie Rose on &#8220;CBS This Morning,&#8221; Monsegur denied directly giving up other hackers&#8217; identities but admitted that his undercover work with the agency after his arrest in 2011 was completely monitored and led to multiple arrests. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/09/hacker-sabu-defends-informing-anonymous-fbi-interview\" type=\"external\">The Guardian</a> reported details on the Charlie Rose interview with Monsegur that day:</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t a situation where I identified anybody.

But is the big biotech destined for perpetual malaise? Not hardly. Here's why the best is yet to come for Gilead.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Getty Images.</p> \n\n<p>The chart below tells an interesting story. Gilead Sciences' trailing-12-month revenue and stock price took off from 2013 through 2015, driven primarily by the prospects and ultimate success for the company's hepatitis C franchise.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://ycharts.com/companies/GILD\" type=\"external\">GILD</a> data by <a href=\"http://ycharts.com\" type=\"external\">YCharts Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Note, though, what has happened more recently. Gilead's stock price is back to where it was in late 2013. The biotech's trailing-12-month revenue, although falling, is still much higher than previous years. That's because change in the stock price is leading change in revenue, which makes sense with investors focusing more on the future than the past.</p> \n\n<p>Gilead Sciences forecasts 2017 revenue between $22.5 billion and $24.5 billion. If you believe that the biotech can't boost its annual revenue to over $33 billion or more, Gilead's best days are behind it. I don't think that's a good bet, though.</p> \n\n<p>I have no doubts that Gilead can beat the revenue highs from past years. To do so should be as easy as A-B-C.</p> \n\n<p>\"A\" stands for acquisitions. Gilead's management team has stated that its top priority isto \"focus on growth for the top line.\" That means acquisitions should be on the way.</p> \n\n<p>Can Gilead really make acquisitions that could generate annual revenue of more than $10 billion or so to get back to its previous revenue levels? Yes, but it would probably take multiple deals.</p> \n\n<p>However, I suspect that's just what Gilead has in mind. CEO John Milligan recently said that he'd like to expand the company's pipeline in three areas:oncology, inflammation, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). His statements imply multiple acquisitions could be on the way.</p> \n\n<p>\"B\" stands for build the pipeline through partnerships. This is an area where Gilead could learn from another big biotech, Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG). If you look at Celgene's pipeline, you'll find several candidates where the company has partnered with another organization. Some are small biotechs, but others are large pharmaceuticdal companies.</p> \n\n<p>Partnerships can be a smart way to secure pipeline assets without shelling out a huge amount of money up front. Celgene, for example, picked up its license for luspatercept through a deal with Acceleron (NASDAQ: XLRN) in 2011 that cost only $25 million up front. As a result, Celgene now is on track to have a product that could generate peak annual sales topping $2 billion.</p> \n\n<p>\"C\" stands for continue what Gilead is already doing. The biotech has several great new products, especially HIV drug Genvoya and hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug Epclusa. Gilead's pipeline includes strong candidates including experimental NASH drug GS-4997 and autoimmune disease drug filgotinib.</p> \n\n<p>Gilead also has a solid cash flow that should keep on flowing. Even though declining sales for HCV drugs Harvoni and Sovaldi will reduce cash flow somewhat, Gilead should still continue to enjoy an enviable cash position that allows the company to fund acquisitions and partnerships.</p> \n\n<p>I think there is a light at the end of the tunnel for Gilead Sciences. The current situation with falling revenue, earnings, and share prices won't go on indefinitely.</p> \n\n<p>How quickly will that light arrive? I expect Gilead to make at least one significant acquisition this year, because executives have said that's what they'd like to do -- and investors clearly want them to do so as well. However, it's possible (perhaps even likely) that the first acquisition announcement won't be big enough to fully offset Gilead's HCV headwinds.</p> \n\n<p>The turnaround will probably take longer than just one year and one acquisition. That's OK, though. It took Gilead Sciences several years to hit its peak. Taking a few years to surpass prior levels isn't unreasonable.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than Gilead SciencesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Two squads cordoned off the village and one, led by Lieutenant William Calley, moved in and, accompanied by US Army Intelligence officers, began to slaughter all the inhabitants. Over the next eight hours US soldiers methodically killed 504 men,&amp;#160; women and children.</p> \n\n<p>As the late Ron Ridenhour, who first exposed the massacre, said years later to one of the present authors, &#8220;Above My Lai were helicopters filled with the entire command staff of the brigade, division and task force. All three tiers in the chain of command were literally flying overhead while it was going on. It takes a long time to kill 600 people. It&#8217;s a dirty job, you might say. These guys were flying overhead from 7:30 in the morning, when the unit first landed and began to move into those hamlets. They were there at least two hours, at 500 feet, 1000 feet and 1500 feet.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The cover-up of this operation began almost from the start. The problem wasn&#8217;t the massacre itself: polls right after the event showed 65 percent of Americans approved of the US action. The cover-up was instead to disguise the fact that My Lai was part of the CIA killing program called Operation Phoenix. As Douglas Valentine writes in his brilliant book, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">The Phoenix Program</a>,</p> \n\n<p>the My Lai massacre was a result of Phoenix, the &#8216;jerry-built&#8217; counter-terror program that provided an outlet for the repressed fears and anger of the psyched-up men of Task Force Barker. Under the aegis of neutralizing the infrastructure, old men, women and children became the enemy. Phoenix made it as easy to shoot a Vietnamese child as it was to shoot a sparrow in a tree. The ammunition was faulty intelligence provided by secret agents harboring grudges &#8211; in violation of the agreement that Census Grievance intelligence would not be provided to the police. The trigger was the blacklist.</p> \n\n<p>The My Lai operation was principally developed by two men, the CIA&#8217;s Paul Ramsdell and a Colonel Khien, the Quang Nai province chief. Operating under cover of the US Agency for International Development, Ramsdell headed the Phoenix program in Quang Nai province, where it was his task to prepare lists of suspected NLF (called by the Americans &#8220;Viet Cong&#8221;) leaders, organizers &amp;#160;and sympathizers. Ramsdell would then pass these lists on to the US Army units that were carrying out the killings. In the case of My Lai, Ramsdell told Task Force Barker&#8217;s intelligence officer, Captain Koutac, that &#8220;anyone in that area was considered a VC sympathizer because they couldn&#8217;t survive in that area unless they were sympathizers.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Ramsdell had acquired this estimate from Col. Khien, who had his own agenda. For one thing, his family had been hit hard by the Tet offensive launched by the NLF earlier in the year. In addition, the NLF had seriously disrupted his business enterprises. Khien was notorious for being one of South Vietnam&#8217;s most corrupt chieftains, an officer who had his hand in everything from payroll fraud to prostitution. But Khien apparently made his really big money from heroin sales to US soldiers.</p> \n\n<p>For the CIA, the need to cover its involvement in the My Lai massacre became acute in August 1970, when Sergeant David Mitchell, a member of Task Force Barker, was put on trial for killing dozens of Vietnamese civilians at My Lai. Mitchell claimed that the My Lai operation had been conducted under the supervision of the CIA. The Agency&#8217;s lawyer, John Greaney, successfully prevented Mitchell&#8217;s lawyers from lodging subpoenas against any Agency personnel. But despite such maneuvers, high CIA and army brass were worried that the truth might trickle out, and so General William Peers of US Army Intelligence was given the task &#8211; so to speak &#8211; of straightening out the furniture.</p> \n\n<p>Peers was a former CIA man whose ties to Agency operations in Southeast Asia dated back to World War II, when he supervised the OSS&#8217;s Detachment 101, the Burma campaign that often operated under the cover of Shan opium trafficking. Peers had also served as CIA station chief in Taiwan in the early 1950s, when the Agency was backing the exiled KMT supremo, Chiang Kai-shek and his henchman Li Mi, Peers had helped design the pacification strategy for South Vietnam and was a good friend of Evan Parker, the CIA officer who headed ICEX (Intelligence Coordination and Exploitation), the command structure that oversaw Phoenix and other covert killing operations. It&#8217;s not surprising, then, that the Peers investigation found no CIA fingerprints on the massacre and instead placed the blame on the crazed actions of the enlisted men and junior officers of Task Force Barker.</p> \n\n<p>In the immediate aftermath of My Lai the polls may have shown 65 percent approval by Americans, but it&#8217;s doubtful whether such momentary enthusiasm would have survived the brute facts of what Operation Phoenix involved. As Bart Osborn, a US Army Intelligence officer collecting names of suspects in the Phoenix Program testified before Congress in 1972,</p> \n\n<p>I never knew in the course of all of these operations any detainee to live through his interrogation. They all died. There was never any reasonable establishment of the fact that any one of those individuals was, in fact, cooperating with the VC, but they all died and the majority were either tortured to death or things like thrown out of helicopters.</p> \n\n<p>One of the more outlandish efforts to protect the true instigators of My Lai came during the 1970 congressional hearings run by Senator Thomas Dodd (father of the present US senator from Connecticut). Dodd was trying to pin the blame for My Lai on drug use by US soldiers. He had seized on this idea <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1859842585/counterpunchmaga\" type=\"external\" />after seeing a CBS news item showing a US soldier smoking marijuana in the jungle after a fire-fight. The senator forthwith convened hearings of his subcommittee on juvenile deliquency, and his staff contacted Ron Ridenhour, the man who had first brought the massacre to light prior to Seymour Hersh&#8217;s journalistic expos&#233;. Ridenhour had long made it his quest to show that My Lai was planned from the top, so he agreed to testify on the condition that he would not have to deal with any foolishness about blaming the murder of over 500 people on dope.</p> \n\n<p>But no sooner had Ridenhour presented himself in the hearing chamber than Dodd began to issue pronouncements about the properties of marijuana so outlandish that Harry Anslinger himself would have approved. Ridenhour got nowhere, denounced the proceedings and expostulated outside the hearing room that &#8220;Dodd is stacking the evidence. Nobody mentioned drugs at My Lai after it happened and they would have been looking for any excuse. Many, many Americans are looking for any reason other than a command decision.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Although Dodd had simply wanted to blame My Lai on drugs and move on, the press now began to take an interest in the whole question of drug use in Vietnam by US forces. The attention prompted a congressional delegation to travel to Vietnam headed by Rep. Robert Steele, a Connecticut Republican, and Rep. Morgan Murphy, a Democrat from Illinois. They spent a month in Vietnam talking to soldiers and medics and returned with a startling conclusion. &#8220;The soldier going to Vietnam,&#8221; Steele said, &#8220;runs a far greater risk of becoming a heroin addict than a combat casualty.&#8221; They estimated that as many as 40,000 soldiers in Vietnam were addicted to heroin. A follow-up investigation by the New York Times reckoned that the count might be even higher &#8211; perhaps as many as 80,000.</p> \n\n<p>The Pentagon naturally preferred a lower figure, putting the total number of heroin addicts at between 100 and 200. But by this time President Nixon had begun to mistrust the flow of numbers out of the Defense Department and dispatched his White House domestic policy council chief, Egil Krogh Jr., to Vietnam for another look. Krogh didn&#8217;t spend time with the generals, but headed out into the field where he watched soldiers openly light up joints and Thai sticks and brag about the purity of the grades of heroin they were taking. Krogh came back with the news that as many as 20 percent of the US troops were heroin users. The figure made a big impression on Richard Nixon, who readily appreciated that although Americans might be prepared to see their sons die on the front lines battling communism, they would be far less enthusiastic at the news that hundreds of thousands of these same sons would be returning home as heroin addicts.</p> \n\n<p>Partially in response to these findings Nixon recruited the CIA into his drug war. The man the Agency chose to put forward as coordinator with the White House was Lucien Conein, a veteran of the CIA&#8217;s station in Saigon, where he had been involved in the coup in 1963 that saw South Vietnam&#8217;s President Ngo Dinh Diem, assassinated along with his brother Ngo Dhin Nhu. (The Diems were regarded by President Kennedy and his advisers as insufficiently robust in pursuing the war. What the CIA proposed, local South Vietnamese generals disposed, and the Diems died in a hail of machine-gun bullets.) At the time of his death Nhu was one of the largest heroin brokers in South Vietnam. His supplier was a Corsican living in Laos named Bonaventure Francisi.</p> \n\n<p>Lucien Conein himself was of Corsican origin, and as part of his intelligence work had maintained ties to Corsican gangsters in Southeast Asia and in Marseilles. His role in the White House drug war team appears to have been not so much one of advancing an effective interdiction of drug supplies as in protecting CIA assets who were tied to the drug trade. For example, one of the CIA&#8217;s first recommendations &#8211; an instinctive reflex, really &#8211; was a &#8220;campaign of assassination&#8221; against global drug lords. The CIA argued that there were only a handful of heroin kingpins and that it would be easy to eliminate all of them. A White House policy memo from 1971 records this piece of Agency advice: &#8220;With 150 key assassinations the entire heroin-refining industry can be thrown into chaos.&#8221; On that list were relatively small-time players and those without any links to the CIA-backed KMT forces that controlled the crucial supply lines out of the Shan States. This discretion was nothing new, since there had been an agreement between Anslinger&#8217;s Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (the forerunner of the DEA) and the CIA not to run any of Anslinger&#8217;s agents in Southeast Asia, lest it discommode the CIA&#8217;s complex living arrangements in the region.</p> \n\n<p>Another tactic advanced by Conein was to contaminate US cocaine supplies with methedrine, the theory being that users would react violently when dosing themselves with this potion and turn violently on their suppliers. There&#8217;s no evidence that either of these schemes &#8211; assassination or methedrine adulteration &#8211; was ever put into play. But the Agency was able to convince the Nixon administration that its eradication effort should be directed at Turkey rather than Southeast Asia, said effort culminating in an attempt at export substitution, with opium growers in Anatolia being helped to set up a factory to produce bicycles.</p> \n\n<p>The CIA was well aware that Turkey provided only between 3 and 5 percent of the world&#8217;s supplies of raw opium at that time. In fact, the Agency had prepared an internal survey that estimated that 60 percent of the opium on the world market was coming from Southeast Asia and noted the precise whereabouts of the four largest heroin labs in the region, in villages in Laos, Burma and Thailand. This report was leaked to the New York Times, whose reporter relayed the main conclusions, without realizing that these villages were all next to CIA stations with the labs being run by people on the CIA&#8217;s payroll.</p> \n\n<p>In April 1971, the CIA&#8217;s ties to the opium kings of Southeast Asia nearly sparked a major international confrontation. Crown Prince Sopsaisana had been appointed Laotian ambassador to France. On arrival in Paris, the prince angrily announced that some of his copious luggage was missing. He berated French airport officials, who meekly promised they would restore his property. In fact the prince&#8217;s bags had been intercepted by French customs after a tip that Sopsaisana was carrying high-grade heroin; indeed, his luggage contained 60 kilos of heroin, worth $13.5 million, then the largest drug seizure in French history. The prince had planned to ship his drug cargo on to New York. The CIA station in Paris convinced the French to cover up the affair, although the prince was not given back his dope. It hardly mattered. Sopsaisana returned two weeks later to Vientiane to nearly inexhaustible supplies of the drug.</p> \n\n<p>Why the CIA interest in protecting the largest trafficker nabbed on the French soil? The opium used to manufacture the prince&#8217;s drugs had been grown in the highlands of Laos. It was purchased by a Hmong general, Vang Pao, who commanded the CIA&#8217;s secret air base in Laos, where it was processed into high-grade Number 4 heroin in labs just down the block from CIA quarters. The heroin was then flown to Vientiane on Vang Pao&#8217;s private airline, which consisted of two C-47s given to him by the CIA.</p> \n\n<p>Vang Pao was the leader of a CIA-sponsored 30,000-man force of Hmong, which by 1971 consisted mostly of teenagers, fighting the Pathet Lao Communist forces. The Hmong had a reputation for fierceness, in part due to a century of conflict with the Chinese, who had, back in the nineteenth century, driven them into Laos after taking over their opium fields in Hunan. As one Hmong put it to Christopher Robbins, author of Air America, &#8220;They say we are a people who like to fight, a cruel people, enemy of everybody, always changing our region and being happy nowhere. If you want to know the truth about our people, ask the bear who is hurt why he defends himself, ask the dog who is kicked why he barks, ask the deer who is chased why he changes mountains.&#8221; The Hmong practiced slash-and-burn agriculture, with two crops &#8211; rice and opium, the first for sustenance and the latter for medicinal and trading purposes.</p> \n\n<p>Vang Pao was born in 1932 in a Laotian hamlet called Nong Het. At the age of thirteen he served as an interpreter for the French forces then fighting the Japanese. Two years later he was battling Viet Minh incursions into Laos in the First Indochina War. He underwent officer training at the French military academy near Saigon, becoming the highest-ranking Hmong in the Royal Laotian Air Force. In 1954 Vang Pao led a group of 850 Hmong soldiers on a fruitless mission to relieve the beleaguered French during their debacle at Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam.</p> \n\n<p>The Hmong were first marshaled into a surrogate army by a French colonel called Roger Trinquier, who confronted a crisis in the French budget for local covert operations and intelligence in a fashion that covered more than one objective. &#8220;The money from the opium,&#8221; he wrote later, &#8220;financed the maquis [that is, the Hmong mercenaries] in Laos. It was flown to Cp. St. Jacques [a French military base sixty miles south of Saigon] in Vietnam in a DC-3 and sold.&#8221; The money was put into an account and used to feed and arm the guerrillas. Trinquier cynically added than the trade &#8220;was strictly controlled even though it was outlawed.&#8221; Overseeing the marketing in Saigon was the local French director of the Deuxi&#233;me Bureau, Colonel Antoine Savani. A Corsican with ties to the Marseilles drug syndicates, Savani organized the Bin Xuyen River gang on the lower Mekong to run the heroin labs, manage the opium dens and sell the surplus to the Corsican drug syndicate. This enterprise, called Operation X, ran from 1946 through 1954.</p> \n\n<p>Ho Chi Minh made opposition to the opium trade a key feature of his campaign to run the French out of Vietnam. The Viet Minh leader said, quite accurately, that the French were pushing opium on the people of Vietnam as a means of social control. A drugged people, Ho said, is less likely to rise up and throw off the oppressor.</p> \n\n<p>During World War II, OSS officers working to oust the Japanese from Southeast Asia developed a cordial relationship with Ho Chi Minh, finding that the Viet Minh leader spoke fluent English and was well versed in American history. Ho quoted from memory lengthy passages from the Declaration of Independence, and chided the intelligence agents, noting that Vietnamese nationalists had been asking American presidents since Lincoln for help in booting out the French colonialists. As with Mao&#8217;s forces in China, the OSS operatives in Vietnam realized that Ho&#8217;s well-trained troops were a vital ally, more capable and less corrupt than Chiang Kai-shek&#8217;s Kuomintang army and the pro-French forces in Indochina. When Ho was stricken with malaria, the OSS sent one of its agents, Paul Helliwell, who would later head up the CIA&#8217;s Overseas Supply Company, to treat the ailing Communist. Similar to Joe Stilwell&#8217;s view of Mao, many military and OSS men recommended that the US should back Ho after the eviction of the Japanese.</p> \n\n<p>After arriving in Vietnam in 1945, US Army General Phillip Gallagher asked the OSS to compile a detailed background on Ho. An OSS operative named Le Xuan, who would later work for the CIA during the Vietnam War, acquired a dossier on Ho from a disaffected Vietnamese nationalist: Le Xuan paid the man off with a bag of opium. The dossier disclosed to US intelligence agencies that Ho had had extended stays in the Soviet Union, a revelation that doomed any future aid from the Americans for his cause. Le Xuan would later turn on the CIA, showing up in Paris in 1968 to reveal his services to the Agency and denounce its murderous policies in Vietnam.</p> \n\n<p>In 1953, Trinquier&#8217;s Operation X opium network was discovered by Colonel Edwin Lansdale, at the time the CIA&#8217;s military adviser in Southeast Asia. Lansdale later claimed that he protested about this French role in opium trafficking, but was admonished to hold his tongue because, in his words, exposure of &#8220;the operation would prove a major embarrassment to a friendly government.&#8221; In fact, the CIA&#8217;s director, Allen Dulles, was mightily impressed by Trinquier&#8217;s operation and, looking ahead to the time when the US would take over from the French in the region, began funneling money, guns and CIA advisers to Trinquier&#8217;s Hmong army.</p> \n\n<p>The post&#8211;Dien Bien Phu accords, signed in Geneva in 1954, decreed that Laos was to be neutral, off-limits to all foreign military forces. This had the effect of opening Laos to the CIA, which did not consider itself a military force. The CIA became the unchallenged principal in all US actions inside Laos. Once in this position of dominance the CIA brooked no interference from the Pentagon. This point was driven home by the military attach&#233; to Laos, Colonel Paul Pettigrew, who advised his replacement in Vientiane in 1961, &#8220;For God&#8217;s sake, don&#8217;t buck the CIA or you&#8217;ll find yourself floating face down on that Mekong River.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>From the moment the Geneva Accords were signed, the US government was determined to undermine them and do everything in its power to prevent the installation of Ho Chi Minh as president of all Vietnam, even though elections would have clearly showed he was the choice of most Vietnamese, as President Dwight D. Eisenhower famously admitted. Eisenhower and his advisers decreed that Laos&#8217;s neutral status should be subverted. On the ground this meant that the neutralist government of Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma, which had amicable relations with the Pathet Lao, should be subverted by the CIA, whose preferred client was General Nosavan Phoumi. The Agency fixed elections in 1960 in an attempt to legitimize his rule. Also in 1960 the CIA began a more sustained effort to build up Vang Pao and his army, furnishing him with rifles, mortars, rockets and grenades.</p> \n\n<p>After John Kennedy&#8217;s victory in 1960, Eisenhower advised him that the next big battleground in Southeast Asia would not be Vietnam but Laos. His counsel found its mark, even though Kennedy initially snooted Laos as &#8220;a country not worthy of engaging the attention of great powers.&#8221; In public Kennedy pronounced the country&#8217;s name as L-AY-o-s, thinking that Americans would not rally to the cause of a place pronounced &#8220;louse.&#8221; In 1960 there were but a thousand men in Vang Pao&#8217;s army. By 1961 &#8220;L&#8217;Arm&#233;e Clandestine&#8221; had grown to 9,000. By the time of Kennedy&#8217;s assassination in late 1963, Vang Pao was at the head of some 30,000 troops. This army and its air force were entirely funded by the United States to the tune of $300 million, administered and overseen by the CIA.</p> \n\n<p>Vang Pao&#8217;s original CIA case officer was William Young, the Baptist missionary-become-CIA-officer we met in the preceding chapter. Young never had any problem with the opium trafficking of the Hmong tribes. After Young was transferred out of the area in 1962, the CIA asked the Frenchman Trinquier to return as military adviser to the Hmong. Trinquier had just completed his tour of duty in the French Congo and consented to perform that function for a few months before the arrival of one of the most notorious characters in this saga, an American named Anthony Posephny, always known as Tony Poe.</p> \n\n<p>Poe was a CIA officer, a former US Marine who had been wounded at Iwo Jima. By the early 1950s he was working for the Agency in Asia, starting with the training of Tibetan Khamba tribesmen in Colorado (thus breaching the law against CIA activities inside the US), prior to leading them back to retrieve the Dalai Lama. In 1958 Poe showed up in Indonesia in an early effort to topple Sukarno. In 1960 he was training KMT forces for raids into China; his right hand was by now mangled after ill-advised contact with a car&#8217;s fanbelt. In 1963 Poe became Vang Pao&#8217;s case officer and forthwith instituted new incentives to fire up the Hmong&#8217;s dedication to freedom&#8217;s cause, announcing that he would pay a cash bounty for every pair of Pathet Lao ears delivered to him. He kept a plastic bag on his front porch where the ears were deposited and strung his collection along the verandah. To convince skeptical CIA superiors, in this case Ted Shackley in Vientiane, that his body counts were accurate, Poe once stapled a pair of ears to a report and sent it to HQ.</p> \n\n<p>This souvenir of early methods of computing the slaughter of native Americans was not as foolproof as Poe imagined. He himself later described going up country and finding a small boy with no ears, then was told that the boy&#8217;s father had sliced them off &#8220;to get money from the Americans.&#8221; Poe shifted his incentive to the entire heads of Pathet Lao, claiming that he preserved them in formaldehyde in his bedroom.</p> \n\n<p>This man, described by an associate as an &#8220;amiable psychopath,&#8221; was running Phoenix-type operations into Lao villages near the Vietnam border. The teams were officially termed &#8220;home defense units,&#8221; though Poe more frankly described them as &#8220;hunter-killer teams.&#8221; Poe later claimed that he was booted out of Long Tieng because he had objected to CIA tolerance of Vang Pao&#8217;s drug trading, but his description suggests more an envy for the French style of direct supervision of the opium trade. In a filmed TV interview at his home in Northern Thailand Poe said in 1987,</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;You don&#8217;t let &#8217;em run loose without a chain on &#8217;em. They&#8217;re like any kind of animals, or a baby. You have to control &#8217;em. Vang Pao was the only guy with a pair of shoes when I met him. Why does he need Mercedes and hotels and homes when he never had them before? Why are you going to give him them? He was making millions. He had his own avenue for selling heroin. He put his money in US bank accounts and Swiss banks, and we all knew it. We tried to monitor it. We controlled all the pilots. We were giving him free rides into Thailand. They were flying it [that is, the opium cargoes] into Danang, where it was picked up by the number two man to Thieu [at the time South Vietnam&#8217;s president]. It was all a contractual relationship, just like bankers and businessmen. A wonderful relationship. Just a Mafia. A big organized Mafia.</p> \n\n<p>By the time Poe left this area of Laos in 1965, the situation was just as he described it twenty years later. The CIA&#8217;s client army was collecting and shipping the opium on CIA planes, which by now were flying under the American flag.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve seen the sticky bricks come on board, and no one challenged it,&#8221; Neal Hanson, an Air America pilot, said in a filmed interview in the late 1980s. &#8220;It was as if it was their personal property. We were a freebie airline. Whoever was put on our plane we flew. Primarily it was the smaller aircraft that would visit outlying villages and bring it [the opium] back to Long Tieng. If they put something on the airplane and told you not to look at it, you didn&#8217;t look at it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The Air America operation played a key role in expanding the opium market. CIA and US Agency for International Development funds went to the construction of more than 150 short, so-called LIMA landing strips in the mountains near the opium fields, thus opening these remote spots to the export trade &#8211; and also ensuring that such exports went to Vang Pao. The head of AID in that area at the time, Ron Rickenbach, said later, &#8220;I was on the air strips. My people were in charge of supplying the aircraft. I was in the areas where the opium was grown. I personally witnessed it being placed on Air America planes. We didn&#8217;t create the opium product. But our presence accelerated it dramatically.&#8221; In 1959 Laos was producing about 150 tons. By 1971 production had risen to 300 tons. Another boost to opium production, much of which was ultimately destined for the veins of Americans then fighting in Vietnam, was enabled by the USAID&#8217;s supplying rice to the Hmong, thus allowing them to stop growing this staple and use the land to cultivate opium poppies.</p> \n\n<p>Vang Pao controlled the opium trade in the Plain of Jars region of Laos. By buying up the one salable crop the general could garner the allegiance of the hill tribes as well as stuff his own bank account. He would pay $60 a kilo, $10 over the prevailing rate, and would purchase a village&#8217;s crop if, in return, the village would supply recruits for his army. As a village leader described it, &#8220;Meo [that is, Hmong] officers with three or four stripes came from Long Tieng to buy their opium. They came in American helicopters, perhaps two or three men at one time. The helicopter leaves them here for a few days and they walk to the villages, then come back here and radio Long Tieng to send another helicopter for them and take the opium back.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>John Everingham, an Australian war photographer, was at that time based in Laos and visited the Hmong village of Long Pot; he recalled in the late 1980s that</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;I was given the guest bed in a district village leader&#8217;s house. I ended up sharing it with a military guy, who I later discovered was a leader in Vang Pao&#8217;s army. I was wakened by a great confusion of people and noise at the bottom of the bed, where there was a packet of black sticky stuff on bamboo leaves. And the village leader was weighing it out and paying quite a considerable amount of money. This went on several mornings. I found out it was raw opium. They all wore American uniforms. The opium went to Long Tieng by helicopters, Air America helicopters on contract to the CIA. I know as a fact that shortly after Vang Pao&#8217;s army was formed, the military officers gained control of the opium trade. It not only helped make them a lot of money. It also helped the villagers who needed their opium carried out, a difficult task in wartime. The officers were obviously paying a very good price because the villagers were very anxious to sell it to them.</p> \n\n<p>In the early 1960s the trading chain from Long Tieng was as follows: the opium would be shipped into Vietnam on Laos Commercial Air, an airline run jointly by Ngo Dinh Nhu and the Corsican Bonaventure Francisi. Nhu, brother of South Vietnam&#8217;s President Diem, had presided over a huge expansion in Saigon&#8217;s opium parlors in order to fund his own security operation. But after the Diem brothers&#8217; assassination, Marshall Nguyen Cao Ky, the man selected by the CIA as South Vietnam&#8217;s new leader, began bringing the opium in from Long Tieng on Vietnamese air force planes. (Ky had previously been head of South Vietnam&#8217;s air force.) A CIA man, Sam Mustard, testified to this arrangement in congressional hearings in 1968.</p> \n\n<p>At the Laotian end, General Phoumi had placed Ouane Rattikone in charge of overall opium operations, and his dealings resulted in about a ton of opium a month being landed in Saigon. For his services, however, Rattikone was getting only about $200 a month from the parsimonious Phoumi. With the backing of the CIA, Rattikone rebelled and launched a coup in 1965 against Phoumi, driving his former boss into exile in Thailand. Rattikone now wanted to drop the contract with the Corsican&#8217;s Air Laos, which, despite Marshall Ky&#8217;s switch, was still doing business. Rattikone&#8217;s plan was to use the Royal Lao Air Force, entirely funded by the CIA. He referred to the opium shipments on the national air force as &#8220;requisitions militaires.&#8221; But CIA air commander Jack Drummond objected to what he deemed a logistically inefficient use of the Royal Lao Air Force&#8217;s T-28s and instead decreed that the CIA would furnish a C-47 for the dope runs &#8220;if they&#8217;d leave the T-28s alone.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>That&#8217;s precisely what happened. Two years later, in 1967, the CIA and USAID purchased two C-47s for Vang Pao, who opened up his own air transport company, which he called Xieng Khouang Air, known by one and all as Air Opium.</p> \n\n<p>At the time the CIA decided to give Vang Pao his own airline, the CIA station chief in Vientiane was Ted Shackley, a man who had gotten his start in the CIA&#8217;s Paperclip project, recruiting Nazi scientists. Before he came to Laos Shackley had headed the Agency&#8217;s Miami station, where he orchestrated the repeated terror raids and assassination bids against Cuba and consorted with the local Cuban &#233;migr&#233;s, themselves deeply involved in the drug trade. Shackley was an ardent exponent of the idea of purchasing the loyalty of CIA clients by a policy of economic assistance, calling this &#8220;the third option.&#8221; Tolerance &#8211; indeed active support &#8211; of the opium trade was therefore a proper military and diplomatic strategy. He also had a reputation for preferring to work with a team of long-term associates whom he would deploy in appropriate posts.</p> \n\n<p>Thus one can follow, through the decades, the Shackley team from Miami, to Laos, to Vietnam (where he later became CIA station chief in Saigon) to his private business operations in Central America. When Shackley was in Vientiane, his associate, Thomas Clines, was handling business at Long Tieng. Another CIA man, Edwin Wilson, was delivering espionage equipment to Shackley in Laos. Richard Secord was supervising CIA operations, thus participating in a bombing program depositing more high explosive on peasants and guerrillas in the Plain of Jars than did the US on Germany and Japan during the whole of World War II. Shackley, Clines, Secord and Air America cargo kicker Eugene Hasenfus show up later in our story, in Central America, once again amid the CIA&#8217;s active complicity in the drug trade.</p> \n\n<p>By the time Shackley moved to Saigon in 1968, the war had turned against Vang Pao. The Pathet Lao now had the upper hand. Over the next three years the story of the Hmong was one of forced marches and military defeats, and as the ground war went badly the CIA took to bombing campaigns that killed yet more Hmong. As Edgar &#8220;Pop&#8221; Buell, a missionary working in the hills, wrote in a memo to the CIA in 1968, &#8220;A short time ago we rounded up 300 fresh recruits [from the Hmong], 30 percent were 14 years old. Another 30 percent were 15 or 16. The remaining 40 percent were 45 or over. Where were the ages between? I&#8217;ll tell you &#8211; they&#8217;re all dead.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>By the end of the war in Laos a third of the entire population of the country had become refugees. In their forced marches the Hmong experienced 30 percent casualty rates, with young children often having to put their exhausted parents, prostrated along the trail, out of their misery. By 1971 the CIA was practicing a scorched-earth policy in Hmong territory against the incoming Pathet Lao. The land was drenched with herbicides, which killed the opium crop and also poisoned the Hmong. Later, when Hmong refugees in Thai refugee camps reported this &#8220;yellow rain,&#8221; CIA-patronized journalists spread the story that this was a Communist essay in biological warfare. The Wall Street Journal editorial page ran an extensive propaganda campaign on the issue in the early Reagan years. Vang Pao ended up in Missoula, Montana. General Ouane Rattikone went into exile in Thailand.</p> \n\n<p>This CIA-transported opium engendered an addiction rate among US servicemen in Vietnam of up to 30 percent, with the soldiers spending some $80 million a year in Vietnam on heroin. In the early 1970s some of this same heroin was being smuggled back to the US in the body bags of dead servicemen, and when DEA agent Michael Levine attempted to bust the operation, he was warned off by his superiors because it might have led to exposure of the supply line from Long Tieng.</p> \n\n<p>In 1971 a second-year grad student at Yale named Alfred McCoy met the poet Allen Ginsberg at a demonstration for Bobby Seale in New Haven. Ginsberg found out that McCoy had studied up on the drug trade and also knew several Southeast Asian languages as well as the political history of the region. He encouraged McCoy to research allegations about CIA involvement in the drug trade. McCoy finished his term papers and traveled to Southeast Asia in the summer of 1971, where he embarked on a courageous and far-reaching investigation that yielded brilliant results. He interviewed troops and officers in Saigon, and there also met John Everingham, the photographer who had witnessed the opium dealings in Laos. Everingham took him back into Laos to that same village. McCoy interviewed Hmong, both villagers and chiefs. He tracked down General Ouane Rattikone in Thailand. He interviewed Pop Buell and the CIA agent William Young.</p> \n\n<p>Back in the United States by the spring of 1972, McCoy had finished the first draft of what was to be the path-breaking <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1556524838/counterpunchmaga\" type=\"external\">The Politics of Heroin in Southeast Asia</a>. In June of that year he was invited to testify before the US Senate by Senator William Proxmire of Wisconsin. Following that testimony, he was called by his publisher Harper &amp;amp; Row, demanding that he come to New York and meet with the company&#8217;s president, Winthrop Knowlton. Knowlton told McCoy that Cord Meyer, a top-ranking CIA officer, had paid a visit to the owner of Harper &amp;amp; Row, Cass Canfield, and had told Canfield that McCoy&#8217;s book posed a national security threat. Meyer demanded that Harper &amp;amp; Row cancel the contract. Canfield refused, but did agree to let the CIA review McCoy&#8217;s book before publication.</p> \n\n<p>While McCoy was deliberating what to do, the CIA&#8217;s approach to Canfield leaked out to Seymour Hersh, then working at the New York Times. Hersh promptly published the story. As McCoy wrote in the preface to a new edition of his book published in 1990, &#8220;Humiliated in the public arena, the CIA turned to covert harassment. Over the coming months, my federal education grant was investigated. My phones were tapped. My income tax was audited and my sources were intimidated.&#8221; Some of his interpreters were threatened with assassination.</p> \n\n<p>The book was duly published by Harper &amp;amp; Row in 1972. Amid Congressional disquiet, the CIA told the Joint Committee on Intelligence that it was pressing forward with an internal review by the CIA&#8217;s Inspector General. The Agency sent twelve investigators into the field, where they spent two brief weeks in interviews. The report has never been released in its entirety, but this is its conclusion:</p> \n\n<p>No evidence that the Agency or any senior officer of the Agency has ever sanctioned, or supported drug trafficking, as a matter of policy. Also we found not the slightest suspicion, much less evidence, that any Agency officer, staff or contact, has ever been involved with the drug business. With respect to Air America, we found that it has always forbidden, as a matter of policy, the transportation of contraband goods. We believe that its Security Inspection Service which is used by the cooperating air transport company as well, is now serving as an added deterrent to drug traffickers.</p> \n\n<p>The one area of our activities in South East Asia that gives us some concern has to do with the agents and local officials with whom we are in contact and who have been or may still be involved in one way or another in the drug business. We are not referring here to those agents who are run as penetrations of the narcotics industry for collection of intelligence on the industry but, rather, to those with whom we are in touch in our other operations. What to do about these people is particularly troublesome in view of its implications for some of our operations, particularly in Laos. Yet their good will, if not mutual cooperation, considerably facilitates the military activities of the Agency-supported irregulars.</p> \n\n<p>The report admitted that &#8220;the war has clearly been our over-riding priority in Southeast Asia and all other issues have taken second place in the scheme of things.&#8221; The report also suggested that there was no financial incentive for the pilots in Air America to be involved in smuggling, since they were &#8220;making good money.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Reviews of McCoy&#8217;s book were hostile, suggesting that his hundreds of pages of well-sourced interviews and reporting amounted to conspiratorial rumor-mongering by a radical opponent of the war. McCoy&#8217;s charges were dismissed out of hand in the Church hearings of 1975, which concluded that allegations of drug smuggling by CIA assets and proprietaries &#8220;lacked substance.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>As McCoy himself summed it up in 1990, in words which no doubt strike a chord in the heart of Gary Webb, &#8220;Although I had scored in the first engagement with a media blitz, the CIA won the longer bureaucratic battle. By silencing my sources and publicly announcing its abhorrence of drugs, the Agency convinced Congress that it had been innocent of any complicity in the Southeast Asian opium trade.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>This article is adapted from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1859842585/counterpunchmaga\" type=\"external\">Whiteout: the CIA, Drugs and the Press</a>.</p> \n\n<p>***</p> \n\n<p>If Worries Was Dollar Bills</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Sound Grammar</p> \n\n<p>What I&#8217;m listening to this week&#8230;</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Ornette at 12 / Crisis</a> by Ornette Coleman <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">New Magic</a> by Son Little <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">14 Steps to Harlem</a> by Garland Jeffries <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Homecoming</a> by Vince Mendoza &amp;amp; the WDR Big Band <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Ununiform</a> by Tricky</p> \n\n<p>Booked Up</p> \n\n<p>What I&#8217;m reading this week&#8230;</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">A Visit to Don Otavio: a Mexican Journey</a> by Sybille Bedford <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Spider Web: the Birth of American Anticommunism</a> by Nick Fischer <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">An Odyssey: a Father, a Son and an Epic</a> by Daniel Mendelsohn</p> \n\n<p>Lynching Music</p> \n\n<p>Viet Thanh Nguyen:&amp;#160;&#8220;Country music was the most segregated kind of music in America, where even whites played jazz and even blacks sang in the opera.

More importantly, they failed to establish the link between the mysterious death and his part in the investigations into the Clinton Foundation anomalies.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Klaus Eberwein, 50, the former director general of the Haitian government's economic development agency, allegedly shot himself in the head past midnight in his Quality Inn hotel room in Miami on Tuesday. Curiously, his apparent \"suicide\" comes just a week before he was scheduled to testify before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The hearing is formally is about the management of PetroCaribe funds, but of course there's no stopping the side discussion on the crucial misappropriation of earthquake donations by the Clinton Foundation during the time of Hillary Clinton's stint as Secretary of State. The Clinton Foundation is, of course, a family affair ran then by former president Bill Clinton and only Clinton child, Chelsea.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Eberwein's death is the second reported suicide in a hotel room of a person who was investigating the Clinton family since May.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The former Haiti official once shared his strong sentiments about the Clintons while speaking at a protest outside he Clinton Foundation headquarters in 2016, as reported by WND. He said:? The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace.?</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Prior to his death, Eberwein expressed fears for his life to fiends for his strong criticisms of the Clinton family. Eberwein had accused the Clinton Foundation of misappropriating international donations meant for the killer-earthquake victims in Haiti, where a negligible amount of money actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations, while the bulk of the money was funneled to non-Haitian organizations of Clintons' choosing, and which are allied with them.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Eberwein's mysterious death follows other puzzling deaths related to the Clintons as well. On May 14, Republican big donor Peter W. Smith, 81, was found dead in his Minnesota hotel room also from \"an apparent suicide.\" His death came 10 days before the publishing of a huge story he had provided to the Wall Street Journal regarding Russian hackers and Hillary's 33,000 missing emails which Eberwein has been seeking.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Smith was found lifeless in his hotel room after allegedly suffocating himself with a plastic bag and helium. Strangely, a suicide note supposedly claims there was no foul play involved, which in turn only raised further suspicions on the mysteries surrounding his death.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Last year, Shawn Lucas who served the Democratic National Committee as process server was also found dead in his apartment from a cocktail of fentanyl, cyclobenzaprine, and mitragynine. He was also involved in a class action lawsuit against DNC and its chairwoman Debbie Wasserman for fraud which DNC sought to dismiss prior to his mysterious death.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>These three deaths were largely ignored by the mainstream media, unlike the case of Seth Rich, although their deaths seem to point to a similar direction- to benefit a family who lost big in last year's presidential elections. Unfortunately, many questions will be hard to answer now, if at all, with the silence their deaths have caused.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Source:</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://bigleaguepolitics.com/former-haitian-official-set-testify-clinton-foundation-found-dead/\" type=\"external\">bigleaguepolitics.com/former-haitian-official-set-testify-clinton-foundation-found-dead</a></p>", "title": "Critic and Witness to Clinton Foundation's Haiti Fraud Found Dead", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://thegoldwater.com/news/5260-Critic-and-Witness-to-Clinton-Foundation-s-Haiti-Fraud-Found-Dead", "published_at": "2017-07-17", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Back in April of 2016, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) announced that it would be implementing restructuring actions that the company said were designed to achieve annual run rate operating expense savings of $1.4 billion.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>At the time, Intel said that the restructuring was intended to \"accelerate [Intel's] evolution from a [personal computer] company to one that powers the cloud and billions of smart, connected computing devices.\"</p> \n\n<p>A wafer of Intel's 7tg generation Core chips. Image source: Intel.</p> \n\n<p>At its Feb. 9 investor meeting, Intel went into much more detail about how it has shifted around its spending. Let's take a closer look.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Intel provided the following chart which illustrates a \"bridge\" from Intel's 2016 operating expenses to its projected 2017 operating expenses:</p> \n\n<p>How Intel's research and development spending is shifting year-over-year. Image source: Intel.</p> \n\n<p>This \"bridge\" shows that Intel expects operating expenses to drop year-over-year due to the spin-off of its Intel Security group (which will now be a stand-alone company called McAfee) as well as reductions in its Client Computing Group (CCG) investment levels.</p> \n\n<p>Offsetting those declines, though, is an increase in investment levels in what the company collectively refers to as its \"growth businesses\" -- Data Center Group, Internet of Things Group, and Non-Volatile Solutions Group.</p> \n\n<p>Additionally, Intel says it's investing more in Moore's Law, which means that it's boosting its investments in next generation manufacturing technologies. This makes sense because the company's new development methodology calls for the company to continue to enhance existing manufacturing technologies while simultaneously developing next-generation ones -- something that it didn't really do before.</p> \n\n<p>All told, Intel is looking at a modest reduction in operating expenses, year-over-year.</p> \n\n<p>In addition to the broad year-over-year spending shifts that Intel talked about above, CFO Bob Swan showed an additional slide that gives more insight into how much research and development spending by market segment is expected to shift from 2015 through 2017.</p> \n\n<p>How Intel's research and development spending changed by product category. Image source: Intel.</p> \n\n<p>Intel is apparently cutting its research and development spending in personal computer processors by 5% in 2017 relative to where it was in 2015. That's not all that much, to be blunt, and I'd imagine the bulk of that shift comes more from accounting changes (i.e. allocating less of its shared operating expenses to the PC segment and more of it to other segments, like the Data Center Group).</p> \n\n<p>Data Center spending is expected to be up by 25% in that two-year period. I'd imagine that part of that increase is due to the shared expense allocation, but I also expect that Intel is increasing its investments here in ways beyond simply a reshuffling of expenses.</p> \n\n<p>Intel's investments in non-volatile memory -- a business that Intel expects to be a key growth engine in the years ahead -- are going up 40%. Considering that technology strength is critical to succeeding in the non-volatile memory business (better technology usually translates into a better cost structure, allowing a company to more effectively compete at good margin levels), the boost in spending isn't a surprise.</p> \n\n<p>The company's investments in mobile are going to be down 55% per the slide. That's not surprising considering that Intel has refocused its mobile business away from trying to build a broad range of platforms to address the broad range of smartphones toward focusing primarily on stand-alone cellular modems, with Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) being the company's principal (only?) smartphone customer here.</p> \n\n<p>And, finally, Intel is expecting a big boost in its investments within its Internet of Things Group. This business has been growing steadily over the last several years and management had indicated that they're making some big bets on new areas like self-driving cars, so a large increase in research and development spending here makes sense -- especially as the odds that those investments will ultimately pay off look good.</p> \n\n<p>At the end of the day, these spending shifts are quite reasonable -- the company is feeding those business segments that have been growing and have the potential to continue to grow, and it's cutting back in areas that aren't expected to grow (i.e. PC processors) as well as in areas where its efforts have fallen flat and success appears unlikely (mobile system-on-chip).</p> \n\n<p>Intel management is investing for the long-term, which is the right thing to do. However, investments in high technology usually take years to bear fruit, so don't expect these increased investments made today to pay off tomorrow. It'll be a couple of years before we know if Intel's increased investments will ultimately pay off.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than IntelWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Ditto Dwight Eisenhower.</p> \n\n<p>JFK was the first president to deliver extended comic speeches, and Lyndon John enlisted Bob Hope and future Jaws novelist Peter Benchley to feed him material.</p> \n\n<p>Richard Nixon had little use for the correspondents association and in 1973, as the Watergate scandal blossomed and he was forced to sit on the dais with journalists who were on his Enemies List, he opened with: &#8220;It is a privilege to be here at the White House correspondents dinner. I suppose I should say it is an executive privilege&#8221;&#8212;a stilted reference to the bogus legal theory the Nixon White House was claiming to avoid handing over incriminating material in the ongoing investigations.</p> \n\n<p>Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.</p> \n\n<p>A speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).</p> \n\n<p>Gerald Ford enjoyed the camaraderie of the dinner both years of his brief presidency, but Jimmy Carter resented that, as he wrote in his diary, he was being forced to sing for his supper and endure face-time with ink-stained wretches who spent the rest of the year attacking and belittling him.</p> \n\n<p>Reagan, a Hollywood denizen who in 1954 emceed a variety show in Las Vegas, was a member of the Friars Club, and later, as governor of California, appeared on several Dean Martin Roasts, was a natural performer who loved having an audience. He was self-deprecating, and he killed. George H.W. Bush, not so much.</p> \n\n<p>Condon tells me Bush 41 was thrilled in 1989 when Garry Shandling agreed on the <a href=\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2016/03/25/my-white-house-night-out-with-garry-shandling.html\" type=\"external\">spur of the moment</a> to help him with his routine. (Obama, meanwhile, will be followed to the microphone by Comedy Central host Larry Wilmore.)</p> \n\n<p>Clinton, who recruited the services of the pre-senatorial Al Franken and Everybody Loves Raymond showrunner Phil Rosenthal, among other comedy pros, was the first president to show videos at the dinner. His final performance in 2000 was graced by a <a href=\"https://charlierose.com/videos/186\" type=\"external\">memorable short film</a> in which he was depicted as a lame-duck chief executive with barely anything to do while his vice president, Al Gore, ran for president and his wife campaigned for a New York Senate seat.</p> \n\n<p>Clinton was shown washing the presidential limo, mowing the South Lawn, playing Battleship in the Situation Room with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, riding a bicycle with his friend Terry McAuliffe up and down the corridors of Old Executive Office Building, and running after Hillary&#8217;s car with the bagged lunch she had forgotten to take with her.</p> \n\n<p>It was, for Clinton, an unusual instance of making fun of himself&#8212;and the crowd at the Hilton roared.</p> \n\n<p>By contrast, it is difficult to imagine that this the sort of tradition would flourish in, say, France (whose quintessential leader, Charles De Gaulle, purposely kept his citizens at bay, believing distance equaled dignity), the People&#8217;s Republic of China, Iran, Saudi Arabia, or, for that matter, Turkey&#8212;whose authoritarian president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, regularly jails political jokesters and recently demanded that the government of Germany <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/11/turkey-germany-prosecute-comedian-jan-bohmermann-erdogan-poem\" type=\"external\">prosecute a German (!) comedian</a> who had the temerity to mock the Turkish strongman on a German (!!) television program. At last report, the German state prosecutor (!!!) was looking into the possibility.</p> \n\n<p>In Britain, Question Time in the House of Commons provides no shortage of wisecracks lobbed back and forth between the prime minister and his or her loyal opposition, and sharp humor intrudes on the occasional after-dinner speech delivered during a party conference. But the joshing and jesting have yet to achieve the formal, ceremonial status that has become compulsory in the Colonies.</p> \n\n<p>The former Tory Leader William Hague of the late 1990s&#8212;later David Cameron&#8217;s foreign secretary&#8212;was renowned for his ripostes during parliamentary debate, ostensibly a technique for eroding the popularity of the governing Labour Party and then-Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;William thinks that humour is a very valuable weapon,&#8221; an ally once <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/how-a-political-joke-is-now-having-the-last-laugh-hague-used-to-be-a-joke-738424.html\" type=\"external\">confided to The Independent</a>. &#8220;The important thing about political jokes is not that they are funny in themselves but that they tell a political truth.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But while Hague&#8217;s fleet-footed japes were applauded in the media, he couldn&#8217;t avoid the fact that they never helped him fulfill his ambition to obtain the top job.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Fat lot of good it did me,&#8221; Hague ruefully noted, according to British journalist Phil Dampier, co-author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/White-House-Wit-Wisdom-Wisecracks/dp/0957379285/\" type=\"external\">White House Wit, Wisdom and Wisecracks</a>, a compendium of presidential one-liners.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Humor is a good way of getting your message across,&#8221; Dampier says, noting that London Mayor Boris Johnson, a former journalist who regularly appeared on the popular BBC show, Have I Got News for You?, parlayed his television persona as an affably bumbling buffoon into elected office. &#8220;And now he&#8217;s being talked about as a possible prime minister,&#8221; Dampier says.</p> \n\n<p>On the other hand, when Queen Elizabeth&#8217;s adult children, led by Prince Edward, ventured into slapstick comedy in 1987&#8212;dressing up as giant vegetables and hurling fake hams at each other and various celebrities to raise money for charity in a television special titled It&#8217;s A Royal Knockout&#8212;the spectacle was widely considered &#8220;a PR disaster,&#8221; Dampier says, &#8220;and seen as a real low point, a cheapening of the monarchy.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The queen, at least, had the good sense not to participate in a farce that would have been a laugh too far even for an American president.</p> \n\n<p>Indeed, University of Minnesota political scientist Lawrence R. Jacobs warns that excessive or misguided joking by a president could ring hollow and harm the office.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The idea of presidents who wield this enormous and increasingly unaccountable power &#8216;having a laugh&#8217;?&#8221; Jacobs says. &#8220;Not so funny.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>An especially piquant example occurred at the Radio TV Correspondents dinner in April 2004, when George W. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/03/26/bush.wmd.jokes/\" type=\"external\">Bush did shtick</a> about the U.S. military not being able to locate Saddam Hussein&#8217;s apparently nonexistent weapons of mass destruction&#8212;the stated rationale for going to war in Iraq</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Those weapons of mass destruction have to got to be somewhere,&#8221; Bush joked while an antic slide show played, showing him searching under furniture in the Oval Office. &#8220;Nope, no weapons over there&#8230; maybe under here?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The public outrage was immediate concerning Bush&#8217;s attempt to find humor in an ill-advised military adventure that had resulted in thousands of Americans and Iraqis dead and wounded.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;There are lines you cannot cross,&#8221; Clinton White House joke-writer Mark Katz, an <a href=\"/content/dailybeast/contributors/mark-katz.html\" type=\"external\">occasional contributor to The Daily Beast</a>, told CNN at the time. &#8220;With regard to going to war, sending American troops to war to find weapons of mass destruction, that&#8217;s a joke that&#8217;s playing out on the world stage&#8212;and is at our expense.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Meanwhile, Jacobs, a regular at comedy clubs in Minneapolis and New York, claims that Obama&#8217;s standup routines tend to be pugnacious rather than hilarious.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;His humor has always struck me as painful in the sense that it was less the joshing around where we&#8217;re all letting our hair down here, and more about settling scores,&#8221; Jacobs says.</p> \n\n<p>Jacobs, for instance, didn&#8217;t appreciate Obama&#8217;s famous and widely praised ( <a href=\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2011/05/01/obama-seth-meyers-joke-about-trump-at-white-house-correspondents-dinner.html\" type=\"external\">including by this reporter</a>) evisceration of Donald Trump&#8212;who at the time, on May 1, 2011, was not the Republican presidential frontrunner but simply a reality show billionaire and rabid birther who&#8217;d been loudly questioning the legitimacy of the president&#8217;s Hawaiian birth certificate.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Donald Trump is here tonight!&#8221; Obama announced to the 3,000-odd dinner-goers in the Hilton ballroom, including Donald and Melania at The Washington Post table. &#8220;I know that he&#8217;s taken some flak lately. But no one is happier, no one is prouder, to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald. And that&#8217;s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter&#8212;like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Trump&#8217;s smile stiffened as Obama continued, &#8220;All kidding aside, obviously we know about your credentials and breadth of experience.&#8221; At this, ripples of laughter coursed through the crowd. &#8220;For example&#8212;seriously&#8212;in an episode of Celebrity Apprentice, at the steak house, the men&#8217;s cooking team did not impress the judges from Omaha Steaks. And there was a lot of blame to go around. But you, Mr. Trump, recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership. And so ultimately you didn&#8217;t blame Lil John or Meatloaf. You fired Gary Busey. And these are the kinds of decisions that would keep me up at night.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The Trumps fled the ballroom that night, and the next day, Navy Seals killed Osama bin Laden. Judd Apatow later claimed credit for writing those Trump jokes for the president&#8212;one of a team of comedy professionals, including Daily Show writer Kevin Bleyer, who regularly have contributed to Obama&#8217;s standup routine.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Trump had it coming to him,&#8221; Jacobs concedes, &#8220;but that&#8217;s the whole point: The president isn&#8217;t there to use humor to get even. That was just him decimating Trump. To me, that&#8217;s not humorous. That&#8217;s abuse.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Standup comic <a href=\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/03/07/the-most-ubiquitous-comedian-in-l-a.html\" type=\"external\">Wayne Federman</a>, Jimmy Fallon&#8217;s former head monologue writer, has a more generous assessment of President Obama&#8217;s comedy stylings.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s right up there with Reagan and John Kennedy as far as being a president who can use humor to his advantage,&#8221; Federman says. &#8220;I just hope that, as usual, he&#8217;s funny, that he&#8217;s warm and reflective about his eight years in office.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In a shout-out to his fellow professional, Federman adds: &#8220;And I&#8217;m rooting for Larry Wilmore to do a good job.&#8221;</p>", "title": "Why The President Has The Last Laugh At The White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://thedailybeast.com/why-the-president-has-the-last-laugh-at-the-white-house-correspondents-dinner", "published_at": "2018-10-07", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>In a new ad released via Instagram, Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign showcases the voices of women accusing Bill Clinton of sexual assault.</p> \n\n<p>Watch the ad below.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&#8220;I was very nervous,&#8221; says the first woman, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/td_13acts.htm\" type=\"external\">Monica Lewinsky</a>.

These products generally enhance security practices and remove friction points from the payment process. These services include diverse offerings from Mastercard's <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/02/05/mastercards-quest-for-the-holy-grail-of-payments.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=61f09908-771f-11e7-82dd-0050569d32b9&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">\"Selfie Pay\" program</a>, which requires users who opt in to the program to take a picture of themselves to authenticate online purchases, to its acquisition of <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/04/10/mastercard-inc-to-acquire-nudata-security-what-inv.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=61f09908-771f-11e7-82dd-0050569d32b9&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">NuData Security</a>, which uses passive biometrics to determine if purchases are fraudulent.</p> \n\n<p>These services and products have helped boost Mastercard's revenue growth over the past several years.

Besides security products, the revenue category also includes consulting and research, loyalty and reward program management, and data analytics.</p> \n\n<p>What makes this quarter different, however, is that now there is evidence that this suite of products and services is not only giving revenue growth a shot in the arm, but also helping Mastercard secure new deals. These services can be extremely valuable to merchants and card issuers alike, as many of them fall far outside their circle of competence. As CFO Martina Hund-Mejean said during the conference call, \"a lot of the banks ... have been grappling with a lot of these issues\" but because Mastercard has \" <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/13/mastercards-mission-to-become-a-full-service-payme.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=61f09908-771f-11e7-82dd-0050569d32b9&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">a fantastic digital suite of products</a>\" the company has been able to \"call out some wins\" the past two quarters.</p> \n\n<p>Mastercard has shown a sustained ability to develop and acquire solutions that enhance its core payment network capabilities. These offerings so appeal to its core banking and retail clients that, over the past several quarters, Mastercard has been able to charge a premium for its services. While we have seen firsthand how this drives the company's revenue growth over the past several quarters, the fact that it is now helping Mastercard secure new deals should encourage shareholders.</p> \n\n<p>Mastercard has been a winner for investors since first going public, rising an amazing 2,680% since its IPO in 2006. Recent investors have nothing to complain about either as its stock price has risen more than 33% over the past year alone.

The sale, contingent on the completion of the AB&amp;#160;InBev-SABMiller deal, would make Molson the number two brewer in the U.S., after AB&amp;#160;InBev.</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Dutra said the company was making progress toward gaining regulatory clearance for the deal on all fronts, including China.</p> \n\n<p>In its next move, AB&amp;#160;InBev&amp;#160;will likely sell SABMiller's stake in the China beer business CR Snow back to the China Resources Enterprise Ltd., which owns 51% of the joint venture.</p> \n\n<p>The company said it expects revenue in 2016 to \"grow organically ahead of inflation\" across the world, partly as a result of management initiatives.</p> \n\n<p>Write to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com</p>", "title": "AB InBev Profit Dented by Falling Emerging Market Currencies", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/markets/2016/02/25/ab-inbev-profit-dented-by-falling-emerging-market-currencies.html", "published_at": "2016-07-06", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>The Machiavellian mind and the merchant mind are at one in their simple faith in the power of segmental division to rule all&#8211;in the dichotomy of power and morals and of money and morals.</p> \n\n<p>Marshall McLuhan, 1962</p> \n\n<p>Westerners, on their way to market, had been looking for a shortcut to the Silk Road, when by happenstance, they ran into a big nipple: The Americas. Knowingly or unknowingly, we live daily with Columbus&#8217; conflict of what to do if confronted by a big nipple unexpectedly.</p> \n\n<p>Columbus couldn&#8217;t wait to write the King and tell him about the New World that he had found; it wasn&#8217;t flat and it wasn&#8217;t a sphere. In his eyes, it was an erect juicy nipple pointed skyward toward God. For the untethered and bank-rolled, the Americas appeared as a Godly geographical go-ahead to suck in and on the garden at everybody else&#8217;s expense. After all, the God of the West had arranged all things in the time-space continuum and he liked big nipples pointed at him, so could Columbus.</p> \n\n<p>The psychological unearthing of the New World in the form of a big juicy nipple was a glorious Gestalt that gave cohesion to unreconciled issues that had been painstakingly pared away from one another over centuries of Western religious and intellectual thought. For the explorer class, the Americas could be the horn of plenty, the sex horn, and the land were they could blow their own horns instead of having it blown for them by popes or kings, or pope-kings, or king-popes. But there were two problems that threatened the Nipples-Up from God: Puritans and Pagans.</p> \n\n<p>So, over time in America, Columbus&#8217; Gestalt has been successfully repurposed for the masses through the art of subliminal appeal and by the status quo acceptance that superior firepower is the same as diplomacy. Modern American culture is the push-pull combination of Columbus&#8217; New World discovery, &#8220;mmm, juicy, sweet,&#8221; and the outsiders that squelched it, the Puritans. For the Puritans, who benefited none the less from Columbus&#8217; savage and highly individuated conquest, their proclivities continue to be comprehensively about the power of sublimation: &#8220;There will be no &#8216;mmm, juicy, sweet&#8217; &#8211;unless there is profit involved.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>So, how do Pagans threaten such developments? Because from time to time, their unwavering and patient proclamations hit air out beyond the reservations: &#8220;duh, &#8216;juicy, sweet&#8217;, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve been trying to tell you, now, please don&#8217;t kill us or convert us&#8211;again.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Dr. Chomsky is right, in the beginning as in the present, the West arrives as a warrior-merchant. Presently, the warrior-merchants of the New Old World are mostly hardworking voyeurs who are not required to fight, one of the many benefits of purchasing power. And the nipples?

Rather than invest directly in real estate by buying actual property, some investors instead opt to put money into REITs. REITs, or real estate investment trusts, are companies that own and operate income-producing real estate.</p> \n\n<p>You can buy shares of an equity REIT or a mortgage REIT, though equity REITs tend to be more popular among investors. Equity REITs are real estate companies that purchase commercial properties and let them out in order to generate income. Equity REITs are a good choice for investors who want a piece of the commercial real estate action without actually having to go out and buy property.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.</p> \n\n<p>Purchasing shares of an equity REIT isn't so very different from buying shares of a publicly traded company's stock. Equity REITs acquire commercial properties that run the gamut from shopping centers to hotels to office complexes to apartments. The goal in acquiring these properties is to generate income by collecting rent from tenants and businesses who lease the space. Some equity REITs are diversified in that they own different types of properties, while others are more specialized. An equity REIT might, for example, focus solely on hotels, while another might focus solely on shopping malls.</p> \n\n<p>Once they've covered the expenses associated with running their properties, equity REITs must pay at least 90% of the income they collect to their shareholders as dividends.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Mortgage REITs work similarly to equity REITs, but they invest in mortgages instead of physical properties. Equity REITs profit by generating rental income from the properties they operate, while mortgage REITs profit by selling mortgages and earning income from the interest on the mortgages they own. Like equity REITs, mortgage REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their income to shareholders.</p> \n\n<p>Both equity REITs and mortgage REITs may be listed on major stock exchanges, but they can also be traded privately. Of the two, equity REITs are far more common, accounting for roughly 90% of the REIT market.</p> \n\n<p>One major benefit of investing in REITs is that they tend to offer higher dividend yields than other investments. REITs are requiredby the IRS to pay at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders; they're not allowed to retain most of their profits to fuel their own growth. As such, their dividend payments tend to be high. Another benefit of investing in REITs is that they offer a degree of diversification. Those who buy REITs can add real estate to their portfolios without assuming the risk and workload of buying actual property.</p> \n\n<p>Though REITs tend to offer attractive yields, there are some risks inherent in investing in them. Not all REITs trade on a public exchange, and those that don't are considered to be a fairly illiquid investment. Investors who buy shares of non-publicly traded REITs run the risk of being unable to sell off their shares quickly when they need money. Furthermore, it can be difficult to gauge the value of non-public REITs, as they don't generally provide per-share estimates until 18 months after their offerings close. Additionally, many non-public REITs come with hefty up-front fees. For these reasons, investors need to weigh all the pros and cons before investing in an equity REIT.</p> \n\n<p>The $15,834 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

The record shows how Putin&#8217;s vision &#8211; although extremely seductive to German industrialists &#8211; was eventually derailed by Washington&#8217;s controlled demolition of Ukraine.</p> \n\n<p>Three years ago, in Kazakhstan and then Indonesia, President Xi Jinping expanded on Putin&#8217;s vision, proposing One Belt, One Road (OBOR), a.k.a. the New Silk Roads, enhancing the geoeconomic integration of Asia-Pacific via a vast network of highways, high-speed rail, pipelines, ports and fiber-optic cables.</p> \n\n<p>In a nutshell: an even more ambitious version of Eurasia integration, benefiting two-thirds of the world population, economy and trade. The difference is that it now comes with immense financial muscle backing it up, via a Silk Road Fund, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the BRICS&#8217;s New Development Bank (NDB), and an all-out commercial offensive all across Eurasia, and the official entry of the yuan in the IMF&#8217;s Special Drawing Rights; that is, the christening of the yuan as a key currency worth holding by every single emerging market central bank.</p> \n\n<p>At the recent G20 in Huangzhou, President Xi clearly demonstrated how OBOR is absolutely central to the Chinese vision of how globalization should proceed. Beijing is betting that the overwhelming majority of nations across Eurasia would rather invest in, and profit from, a &#8220;win-win&#8221; economic development project than be bogged down in a lose-lose strategic game between the US and China.</p> \n\n<p>And that, for the Empire of Chaos, is absolute anathema. How to possibly accept that China is&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">winning</a> the 21st century / New Great Game in Eurasia by building the New Silk Roads?</p> \n\n<p>And don&#8217;t forget the Silk Road in Syria</p> \n\n<p>Few in the West have noticed, as <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/business/357954-eastern-economic-forum-vladivostok/\" type=\"external\">reported</a>&amp;#160;by RT, that the G20 was preceded by an Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok. Essentially, that was yet another de facto celebration of Eurasia integration, featuring Russia, China, Japan and South Korea.</p> \n\n<p>And that integration plank will soon merge with the Russia-led Eurasia Economic Union &#8211; which in itself is a sort of Russian New Silk Road.</p> \n\n<p>All these roads lead to total connectivity. Take for instance cargo trains that are now regularly <a href=\"http://investkaluga.com/en/ploschadki/industrialnye-parki-2/industrialnyy-park-vorsino/\" type=\"external\">linking</a>Guangzhou, the key hub in southeast China, to the logistics center in&amp;#160; Vorsino industrial park near Kaluga. The trip now takes just two weeks &#8211; saving no less than a full month if compared with shipping, and around 80 percent of the cost if compared with air cargo.</p> \n\n<p>That&#8217;s yet another New Silk Road-style connection between China and Europe via Russia. Still another, vastly more ambitious, will be the high-speed rail expansion of the Transiberian; the Siberian Silk Road.</p> \n\n<p>Then take the closer integration of China and Kazakhstan &#8211; which is also a member of the EEU. The duty-free Trans-Eurasia railway is already in effect, from Chongqing in Sichuan across Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus and Poland all the way to Duisburg in Germany. Beijing and Astana are developing a joint free trade zone at Horgos. And in parallel, a $135 million China-Mongolia Cross-Border Economic Cooperation Zone started to be built last month.</p> \n\n<p>Kazakhstan is even flirting with the ambitious idea of a Eurasian Canal from the Caspian to the Black Sea and then further on to the Mediterranean. Sooner or later Chinese construction companies will come up with a feasibility study.</p> \n\n<p>A virtually invisible Washington agenda in Syria &#8211; inbuilt in the Pentagon obsession to not allow any ceasefire to work, or to prevent the fall of its &#8220;moderate rebels&#8221; in Aleppo &#8211; is to break up yet another New Silk Road hub. China has been commercially connected to Syria since the original Silk Road, which snaked through Palmyra and Damascus. Before the Syrian &#8220;Arab Spring&#8221;, Syrian businessmen were a&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175935/tomgram%3A_pepe_escobar%2C_eurasian_integration_vs._the_empire_of_chaos/#more\" type=\"external\">vital presence</a> in Yiwu, south of Shanghai, the largest wholesale center for small-sized consumer goods in the world, where they would go to buy all sorts of products in bulk to resell in the Levant.</p> \n\n<p>The &#8220;American lake&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Neocon/neoliberalcon Washington is totally paralyzed in terms of formulating a response &#8211; or at least a counter-proposal &#8211; to Eurasia integration. A few solid IQs at least may understand that China&#8217;s &#8220;threat&#8221; to the US is all about economic might. Take Washington&#8217;s deep hostility towards the China-driven&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://euweb.aiib.org/html/aboutus/introduction/aiib/\" type=\"external\">AIIB</a> (Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank). Yet no amount of hardcore US lobbying prevented allies such as Germany, Britain, Australia and South Korea from joining in.</p> \n\n<p>Then we had the mad dash to approve TPP &#8211; the China-excluding, NATO-on-trade arm of the pivot to Asia that was meant to be the cherry of the mostly flat Obama global economic policy cake. Yet the TPP as it stands is practically dead.</p> \n\n<p>What the current geopolitical juncture spells out is the US Navy willing to go no holds barred to stop China from strategically dominating the Pacific, while TPP is deployed as a weapon to stop China dominating Asia-Pacific economically.</p> \n\n<p>With the pivot to Asia configured as a tool to &#8220;deter Chinese aggression&#8221;, exceptionalists have graphically demonstrated how they are incapable of admitting the whole game is about post-ideological supply chain geopolitics. The US does not need to contain China; what it needs, badly, is key industrial, financial, commercial connection to crucial nodes across Asia to (re)build its economy.</p> \n\n<p>Those were the days, in March 1949, when MacArthur could gloat, &#8220;the Pacific is now an Anglo-Saxon lake&#8221;. Even after the end of the Cold War the Pacific was a de facto American lake; the US violated Chinese naval and aerial space at will.</p> \n\n<p>Now instead we have the US Army War College and the whole Think Tankland losing sleep over sophisticated Chinese missiles capable of denying US Navy access to the South China Sea. An American lake? No more.</p> \n\n<p>The heart of the matter is that China has made an outstanding bet on infrastructure building &#8211; which translates into first-class connectivity to everyone &#8211; as the real global 21st century commons, way more important than &#8220;security&#8221;. After all a large part of global infrastructure still needs to be built. While China turbo-charges its role as the top global infrastructure exporter &#8211; from high-speed rail to low-cost telecom &#8211; the &#8220;indispensable&#8221; nation is stuck with a &#8220;pivoting&#8221;, perplexed, bloated military obsessed with containment.</p> \n\n<p>Divide and rule those &#8220;hostile&#8221; rivals</p> \n\n<p>Well, things haven&#8217;t changed much since Dr. Zbig &#8220;Grand Chessboard&#8221; Brzezinski dreaming in the late 1990s of a Chinese fragmentation from within, all the way to Obama&#8217;s 2015 National Security Strategy, which is no more than futile rhetorical nostalgia about containing Russia, China and Iran.</p> \n\n<p>Thus the basket of attached myths such as &#8220;freedom of navigation&#8221; &#8211; Washington&#8217;s euphemism for perennially controlling the sea lanes that constitute China&#8217;s supply chain &#8211; as well as an apotheosis of&#8220;China aggression&#8221; incessantly merging with &#8220;Russia aggression&#8221;;after all, the Eurasia integration-driven Beijing-Moscow strategic partnership must be severed at all costs.</p> \n\n<p>Why? Because US global hegemony must always be perceived as an irremovable force of nature, like death and taxes (Apple in Ireland excluded).</p> \n\n<p>Twenty-four years after the Pentagon&#8217;s Defense Planning Guide, the same mindset prevails; &#8220;Our first objective is to prevent the reemergence of a new rival&#8230;to prevent any hostile power from dominating a region whose resources would, under consolidated control, be sufficient to generate global power. These regions include Western Europe, East Asia, the territory of the former Soviet Union and southwest Asia&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>Oops. Now even Dr. Zbig &#8220;Grand Chessboard&#8221; Brzezinski is terrified. How to contain these bloody silky roads with Pentagon &#8220;existential threats&#8221; China and Russia right at the heart of the action? Divide and Rule &#8211; what else?</p> \n\n<p>For a confused Brzezinski, the US&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">should</a>&amp;#160;&#8220;fashion a policy in which at least one of the two potentially threatening states becomes a partner in the quest for regional and then wider global stability, and thus in containing the least predictable but potentially the most likely rival to overreach. Currently, the more likely to overreach is Russia, but in the longer run it could be China.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Have a pleasant nightmare.</p> \n\n<p>This piece first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/op-edge/361898-new-silk-roads-terrify/\" type=\"external\">RT</a>.</p>", "title": "Why the New Silk Roads terrify Washington", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2016/10/10/why-the-new-silk-roads-terrify-washington/", "published_at": "2016-10-10", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p><a href=\"//videos/37/63175\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>RUSH: These polling numbers?

We can&#8217;t even go there.&#8221; I think people who say that are actually doing their own version of Gruber: &#8220;Gruber said what? Gruber said that people are stupid. The American people are stupid. Even though they&#8217;re stupid, we&#8217;ve gotta lie to &#8217;em. We&#8217;re gonna rely on the stupidity of the American people.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Okay, if you believe&#8230; If you are an inside-the-Beltway media or elected official elitist or honcho, and, if you don&#8217;t want to get anywhere near action &#8212; like a series of bills that would deny Obama the funding necessary either to implement amnesty, or elements of Obamacare, because that would be a government shutdown, and the Republicans will get blamed no matter what happens, and they&#8217;ll never recovered from it, and it&#8217;s horrible, and it&#8217;s messy &#8212; aren&#8217;t you essentially the same as Jonathan Gruber?</p> \n\n<p>Aren&#8217;t you really saying the American people are too stupid to understand what&#8217;s really going on?</p> \n\n<p>Aren&#8217;t you saying, &#8220;No, no! We can&#8217;t have a series of bills that will defund various steps of amnesty. Why, that would shut down the government, and then we&#8217;ll get blamed for it.&#8221; So you believe the American people are so stupid that even though they just elected you to stop this, when you take action to stop it they&#8217;re gonna get so mad at you for shutting down the government, that they&#8217;re never gonna elect you again, and the media is gonna have a field day with you?</p> \n\n<p>Aren&#8217;t you kind of just like Jonathan Gruber? Aren&#8217;t you, in essence saying, &#8220;No, we can&#8217;t do what&#8217;s right because the American people are too stupid to see what we&#8217;re doing, and they will blame us, and we don&#8217;t want to get blamed&#8221;? It seems to me that a year ago in December there was a government shutdown, and Ted Cruz got blamed for it left and right.</p> \n\n<p>And the last I saw, the Republicans just won a landslide election a little over a week ago. So where is it written that government shutdowns destroy Republican electoral efforts? Where is it written that defunding this part of Obamacare or that part of amnesty equals a government shutdown anyway? I think it&#8217;s time for people to realize &#8212; Republicans, especially &#8212; that the people who voted for &#8217;em are not stupid.</p> \n\n<p>BREAK TRANSCRIPT</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: Here&#8217;s Obama. This takes us to where we&#8217;re headed here in this segment. This is Sunday morning in Brisbane. This is the end of the G20 Summit, Obama at a press conference and CBS Correspondent Major Garrett said, &#8220;How much do you fear the government will shut down and to what degree does your anxiety about this or your team&#8217;s anxiety about this influence the timing of your decision on&#8221; amnesty.</p> \n\n<p>OBAMA: I take Mitch McConnell at his word when he says that the government&#8217;s not gonna shut down. There&#8217;s no reason for it to shut down. Uh, we traveled down that path before. Uh, it was bad for the country.</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: It was not.</p> \n\n<p>OBAMA: It was, uh, bad for every elected official in the country &#8212;</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: No, it wasn&#8217;t.</p> \n\n<p>OBAMA: &#8212; and at the end of the day was resolved in the same way that it would have been resolved if we hadn&#8217;t shut the government down. So, uh, that&#8217;s not gonna be productive.</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: That&#8217;s not even true.</p> \n\n<p>Look, there was a government shutdown. I do this for a living, and I don&#8217;t even remember what it was about. That&#8217;s how big it was. Now Snerdley, who is a wonk, probably remembers. All I know is that Ted Cruz getting blamed for it everywhere. What was it over? (interruption) &#8220;Continuing resolution for funding.&#8221; Okay, so we shut down the government over the mechanism that we were gonna pay for the next series of months of government, the continuing resolution.</p> \n\n<p>The Republicans have been trying to stop the Democrats and get &#8217;em to do a budget as required by law, and they&#8217;ve been doing this continuing resolution stuff, which&#8230; (interruption) Well, I know. The typical sleigh ride guy at Jellystone got sidelined for a while, but he got his money back. They all do. The government workers that lost their jobs for a couple days got their Thanksgiving and Christmas turkeys.</p> \n\n<p>It always ends up that way. The point is, there was a government shutdown, and there was no politician that got hurt. The last I looked, the Republicans won a landslide election last week or week half ago &#8212; and they were the guys blamed for the shutdown last January, am I right? (interruption) The Republicans were blamed for the shutdown last December, 2013, right? (interruption) Okay.</p> \n\n<p>Single-handedly! Ted Cruz and the Republicans were tarred and feathered and blamed and everything was laid at their feet and it was a disaster, and what happened? The Republicans win a landslide election less than a year later. So where is it written that government shutdowns&#8230; Now, granted, in a government shutdown, the media is going to hate you. The media is gonna say mean things about you.</p> \n\n<p>The media is gonna call you racist and sexist and bigoted and homophobic, and the media is gonna call you mean-spirited, and the media is gonna call you extremist, and the media is gonna say, &#8220;You don&#8217;t like the little guy,&#8221; and the media is gonna lie about you. But it didn&#8217;t hurt, did it? If the Republicans shutting down the government last year was political disaster, somebody explain the results of ten days ago for me.</p> \n\n<p>But I know how the inside-the-Beltway thinks, and it is typified here and personified by Brit Hume of Fox News. This is yesterday on Fox News Sunday during the panel discussion. The host Chris Wallace was speaking with senior political analyst Brit Hume about immigration reform and the federal budget, and Chris Wallace said, &#8220;If Republicans somehow tie funding of the government to opposition to this executive action, is it a smart political move or is it another mistake?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The question is: If the Republicans tried to stop Obama from doing amnesty by denying funding for this aspect of it and that aspect of it &#8212; you know, a bunch of different aspects of it &#8212; Wallace is asking Hume: Is that a smart political move or would that be another mistake? Meaning: Would it be dumb to deny the government money, or would it be good politics?</p> \n\n<p>HUME: It&#8217;s a total blunder to try that. It is an iron rule in Washington exemplified many times that if the government shuts down, the Republicans get the blame. Not some of the blame, not most of the blame, all of the blame. And one would surmise that &#8212; that they may have learned that by now. Their leaders seem to have, but there are some within the House and Senate who still think that that kind of a brinksmanship might work. I doubt it.</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: And then Karl Rove this morning on Fox &amp;amp; Friends was being interviewed by Elisabeth Hasselbeck &#8212; by the way, welcome back to her. She had a cancer scare out there. She&#8217;s been gone for a month, she&#8217;s back. She said, &#8220;Republicans are now weighing a government shutdown to put pressure against the president who seems to be ready to use executive actions as it relates to immigration. Is that a good move or not, Karl?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>ROVE: Actually it&#8217;s not Republicans, it&#8217;s a few Republicans. When we had the government shutdown last year, you may remember the poll in the immediate aftermath, 17% of the American people approved of it, 81% didn&#8217;t, and who&#8217;d they blame? I think it was like 59% blamed the Republicans. It took us a year to get back.</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: Uh, what, uh, uhhh, you got back, though, right? And how&#8217;d you do that? It took a year to get back, but you got back. How did you get back? What happened? You got back because people wanted you to stop Obama. Now, on this shutdown business, I think, in the first place, this is not technically a government shutdown. Just telling Obama we&#8217;re not gonna give you the money for, say, a driver&#8217;s license for these people. We&#8217;re not gonna give you the money for Social Security cards for these people. We&#8217;re not gonna give you the money. How the hell is that a government shutdown, for crying out loud?</p> \n\n<p>But even if it is, it seems to me &#8212; and I say this with all due respect. I am not a flamethrower here, and I&#8217;m not trying to pick a fight. I am just trying to serve this audience the best I can, and it seems to me that this fear that whenever anything happens, that the media can call a government shutdown and therefore we can&#8217;t do it &#8217;cause the Republicans are gonna get blamed and don&#8217;t want that, aren&#8217;t you kind of being just like Jonathan Gruber in assuming the people are so stupid they won&#8217;t be able to figure out who&#8217;s really responsible for this?</p> \n\n<p>Add to this the fact, if you want to talk polling data, whatever poll you want to cite, you&#8217;ve got 55 to 60% of the American people who disapprove of Obamacare and want it repealed. So if you take action to deny Obama funding to implement it and somebody calls that a government shutdown, how in the hell are the people gonna get mad at you for trying to stop the implementation of Obamacare when that&#8217;s what you were elected to do?</p> \n\n<p>This inordinate fear that the Republicans are, no matter what happens, gonna get blamed for it seems to rely on the fact that the American people are so stupid that they will always believe what the media tells them and that they will never question it. If this is way you look at &#8212; why should the Republicans ever oppose anything? Because we know what the media is going to say about them.</p> \n\n<p>The media is gonna call the Republicans names no matter what the Republicans do or say, and if our policy decisions are going to be rooted in trying to limit what the media says, aren&#8217;t we conceding defeat? And aren&#8217;t we at the same time pretty much saying that we are afraid that the American people are too stupid to see our actions for what they are, and that is, trying to save the country from the disasters of Obama&#8217;s policy implementations. And I would say the same thing about amnesty.</p> \n\n<p>The majority of the American people, no matter where you look, no matter what poll, nobody&#8217;s in favor of it. Nobody wants executive amnesty. It&#8217;s not a majority position. Nothing Obama is doing is a majority position to support. So any action the Republicans might take after having won a landslide election, I mean, that has to be a factor here. They were just elected to stop this stuff, and so they take action to stop it, and the media accuses them of shutting down the government, and the American people are so stupid that right then and there they&#8217;re gonna regret that they voted for the Republicans.</p> \n\n<p>And the Republicans are gonna be paying the price for, what, another year &#8217;til the next election, another two years. How did the Republicans win this election if they got blamed for the shutdown last December? &#8220;Well, it took a year to get back.&#8221; Well, they got back. I don&#8217;t know. This is unnecessarily tying your own hands behind your back.</p> \n\n<p>BREAK TRANSCRIPT</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: Okay. So the establishment, they say they will not shut down the government. What that means is, they&#8217;re not gonna deny Obama any funding to implement his various schemes, so what are they gonna do? It&#8217;s a serious question. I mean, they were elected to do something here. They were elected to stop this. Even if you think they were elected to do more than that, fine and dandy. I don&#8217;t want to get into an argument about that. But you can&#8217;t deny that part and parcel of the reason for this electoral win was to stop what is happening.</p> \n\n<p>If they&#8217;re not going to use the power of the purse, and if they&#8217;re not going to use impeachment, then what are they going to do to stop it? That&#8217;s gonna get them in more trouble with voters than any so-called government shutdown. The worst thing they could do is ignore the mandate the voters gave &#8217;em. That looks like what they&#8217;re aiming for.</p> \n\n<p>BREAK TRANSCRIPT</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: This is Sally, Richmond, Virginia. Great to have you on the EIB Network. Hello.</p> \n\n<p>CALLER: Hey, Rush. How are you?</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: I&#8217;m not well. Thank you very much.</p> \n\n<p>CALLER: Good! I wanted to comment about your conversation about the Republicans and shutting down the government.</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: Yeah?</p> \n\n<p>CALLER: I actually think Ted Cruz and the Republicans that supported the government shutdown, caused the wake-up call and they were what caused people to pay attention and get engaged, and they drew people&#8217;s attention to the truth about Obamacare and what the negative impacts were gonna be. Not only on the economy, but the level of care that we were all gonna eventually experience, and the rising costs.</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: That is an interesting take, because Ted Cruz did get the blame, right?</p> \n\n<p>CALLER: He got the blame but he really should be getting the praise.</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: Well, but wait. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m saying. He did. The point is: Did Ted Cruz lose any popularity?</p> \n\n<p>CALLER: He lost popularity outside of the Republican Party but also within the party.</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: Well, no. I&#8217;m talk with the American people.</p> \n\n<p>CALLER: No! No.</p> \n\n<p>RUSH: No, he didn&#8217;t lose popularity. He might have been enemy number one inside the party, but in terms of the people? The voters didn&#8217;t take it out on Ted Cruz. That&#8217;s a good observation, interesting observation. Sally, I appreciate the call.

Analysts are waiting to see how well the watch will sell beyond devoted Apple fans. Apple has a better chance at succeeding than any other smartwatch maker so far, yet it will likely take time before sales reach the kind of numbers that Apple gets for iPhones and iPads.</p> \n\n<p>Watch prices start at $349, but can go as high as $17,000 for a luxury edition in gold. People can try the watch on in Apple stores, but for now all orders are being handled online. Shipments begin April 24.</p> \n\n<p>It's available in the U.S. and eight other markets around the world. In the U.S., the watch is available only in Apple stores. In some countries, select department stores and resellers also have it.</p> \n\n<p>Here's a look at developments surrounding Apple Watch, latest updates first:</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>3:01 a.m. EDT (12:01 a.m. in Cupertino, California):</p> \n\n<p>Ready, set, go ...</p> \n\n<p>Apple starts taking orders for the watch on its website and Apple Store app. Currently, this is the only way Apple is selling the watch.

Once it becomes viable, this magic elixir &#8212; made from grass, wood chips, sawdust, or some other plant material &#8212; will deliver us from the evil clutches of foreign oil and make the U.S. &#8220;energy independent&#8221; while enriching farmers and strengthening small towns across the country.</p> \n\n<p>Consider this claim: &#8220;From our cellulose waste products on the farm such as straw, corn-stalks, corn cobs and all similar sorts of material we throw away, we can get, by present known methods, enough alcohol to run our automotive equipment in the United States.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>That sounds like something you&#8217;ve heard recently, right? Well, fasten your seatbelt because that claim was made way back in 1921. That&#8217;s when American inventor Thomas Midgley proclaimed the wonders of cellulosic ethanol to the Society of Automotive Engineers in Indianapolis. And while Midgley was excited about the prospect of cellulosic ethanol, he admitted that there was a significant hurdle to his concept: producing the fuel would cost about $2 per gallon. That&#8217;s about $20 per gallon in current money.</p> \n\n<p>Alas, what&#8217;s old is new again.</p> \n\n<p>I wrote about the myriad problems of cellulosic ethanol in my book, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Gusher of Lies</a>. But the hype over the fuel continues unabated. And it continues even though two of the most prominent cellulosic ethanol companies in the U.S., Aventine Renewable Energy Holdings and Verenium Corporation, are teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. As noted last week by Robert Rapier on his R-Squared Energy blog, Verenium&#8217;s auditor, Ernst &amp;amp; Young, recently expressed concern about the company&#8217;s ability to continue as a going concern and Aventine was recently delisted from the New York Stock Exchange.</p> \n\n<p>On March 16, the accounting firm Ernst &amp;amp; Young said Verenium may be forced to &#8220;curtail or cease operations&#8221; if it cannot raise additional capital. And in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company&#8217;s management said &#8220;We continue to experience losses from operations, and we may not be able to fund our operations and continue as a going concern.&#8221; Last week, the company&#8217;s stock was trading at $0.36 per share. It has traded for as much as $4.13 over the past year.</p> \n\n<p>Aventine&#8217;s stock isn&#8217;t doing much better. Earlier this month, the company announced that it may seek bankruptcy protection if it cannot raise additional cash. Last Friday, Aventine&#8217;s shares were selling for $0.09. Over the past year, those shares have sold for as much as $7.86.</p> \n\n<p>The looming collapse of the cellulosic ethanol producers deserves more than passing notice for this reason: cellulosic ethanol &#8211; which has never been produced in commercial quantities &#8212; has been relentlessly hyped over the past few years by a panoply of politicians and promoters.</p> \n\n<p>The list of politicos includes Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, President Barack Obama, former vice president Al Gore, former Republican presidential nominee and U.S. Senator John McCain, former president Bill Clinton, former president George W. Bush and former CIA director James Woolsey.</p> \n\n<p>There are plenty of others who deserve to take a bow for their role in promoting the delusion of cellulosic ethanol. Prominent among them: billionaire investor/technologist Vinod Khosla. In 2006, Khosla claimed that making motor fuel out of cellulose was &#8220;brain dead simple to do.&#8221; He went on, telling NBC&#8217;s Stone Phillips that cellulosic ethanol was &#8220;just around the corner&#8221; and that it would be a much bigger source of fuel than corn ethanol. Khosla also proclaimed that by making ethanol from plants &#8220;in less than five years, we can irreversibly start a path that can get us independent of petroleum.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In 2007, Kholsa delivered a speech, &#8220;The Role of Venture Capital in Developing Cellulosic Ethanol,&#8221; during which he declared that cellulosic ethanol and other biofuels can be used to completely replace oil for transportation. More important, Khosla predicted that cellulosic ethanol would be cost competitive with corn ethanol production by 2009.</p> \n\n<p>Two other promoters who have declared that cellulosic ethanol is just on the cusp of viability: Mars exploration advocate Robert Zubrin, and media darling Amory Lovins.</p> \n\n<p>Of all the people on that list, Lovins has been the longest &#8211; and the most consistently wrong &#8211; cheerleader for cellulosic fuels. His boosterism began with his 1976 article in Foreign Affairs, a piece which arguably made his career in the energy field. In that article, called &#8220;Energy Strategy: The Road Not Taken?&#8221; Lovins argued that American energy policy was all wrong. What America needed was &#8220;soft&#8221; energy resources to replace the &#8220;hard&#8221; ones (namely fossil fuels and nuclear power plants.) Lovins argued that the U.S. should be working to replace those sources with other, &#8220;greener&#8221; energy sources that were decentralized, small, and renewable. Regarding biofuels, he wrote that there are &#8220;exciting developments in the conversion of agricultural, forestry and urban wastes to methanol and other liquid and gaseous fuels now offer practical, economically interesting technologies sufficient to run an efficient U.S. transport sector.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Lovins went on &#8220;Some bacterial and enzymatic routes under study look even more promising, but presently proved processes already offer sizable contributions without the inevitable climatic constraints of fossil-fuel combustion.&#8221; He even claims that given enough efficiency in automobiles, and a large enough bank of cellulosic ethanol distilleries, &#8220;the whole of the transport needs could be met by organic conversion.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In other words, Lovins was making the exact same claim that Midgley made 45 years earlier: Given enough money &#8211; that&#8217;s always the catch isn&#8217;t it? &#8211; cellulosic ethanol would provide all of America&#8217;s transportation fuel needs.</p> \n\n<p>The funny thing about Lovins is that between 1976 and 2004 &#8212; despite the fact that the U.S. still did not have a single commercial producer of cellulosic ethanol &#8212; he lost none of his skepticism. In his 2004 book Winning the Oil Endgame, Lovins again declared that advances in biotechnology will make cellulosic ethanol viable and that it &#8220;will strengthen rural America, boost net farm income by tens of billions of dollars a year, and create more than 750,000 new jobs.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Lovins continued his unquestioning boosterism in 2006, when during testimony before the U.S. Senate, he claimed that &#8220;advanced biofuels (chiefly cellulosic ethanol)&#8221; could be produced for an average cost of just $18 per barrel.</p> \n\n<p>Of course, Lovins isn&#8217;t the only one who keeps having visions of cellulosic grandeur. In his 2007 book, Winning Our Energy Independence, S. David Freeman, the former head of the Tennessee Valley Authority, declared that to get away from our use of oil, &#8220;we must count on biofuels.&#8221; And a key part of Freeman&#8217;s biofuel recipe: cellulosic ethanol. Freeman claims that &#8220;there is huge potential to generate ethanol from the cellulose in organic wastes of agriculture and forestry.&#8221; He went on, saying that using some 368 million tons of &#8220;forest wastes&#8221; could provide about 18.4 billion gallons of ethanol per year, yielding &#8220;the equivalent of about 14 billion gallons gasoline [sic], or about 10 percent of current gasoline consumption.&#8221; Alas, Freeman fails to provide a single example of a company that has made a commercial success of cellulosic ethanol.</p> \n\n<p>Cellulosic ethanol gained even more acolytes during the 2008 presidential campaign.</p> \n\n<p>In May 2008, the Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi touted the passage of the subsidy-packed $307 billion farm bill, declaring that it was an &#8220;investment in energy independence&#8221; because it providing &#8220;support for the transition to cellulosic ethanol.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>About the same time that Pelosi was touting the new farm bill, a spokesman for the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol industry lobbying group in Washington, was claiming that corn ethanol was merely a starting point for other &#8220;advanced&#8221; biofuels. &#8220;The starch-based ethanol industry we have today, we&#8217;ll stick with it. It&#8217;s the foundation upon which we are building next-generation industries,&#8221; said Matt Hartwig, a spokesman for the lobby group.</p> \n\n<p>In August 2008, Obama unveiled his &#8220;new&#8221; energy plan which called for &#8220;advances in biofuels, including cellulosic ethanol.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>After Obama&#8217;s election, the hype continued, particularly among Democrats on Capitol Hill. In January 2009, Tom Harkin, the Iowa senator who&#8217;s been a key promoter of the corn ethanol scam, told PBS: &#8220;ethanol doesn&#8217;t necessarily all have to come from corn. In the last farm bill, I put a lot of effort into supporting cellulose ethanol, and I think that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re going to see in the future&#8230;You&#8217;re going to see a lot of marginal land that&#8217;s not suitable for row crop production, because it&#8217;s hilly, or it&#8217;s not very productive for corn or soybeans, things like that, but it can be very productive for grasses, like miscanthus, or switchgrass, and you can use that to make the cellulose ethanol.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Despite the hype, cellulosic ethanol is no closer to commercial viability than it was when Midgley first began talking about it back in 1921. Turning switchgrass, straw or corn cobs into sizable volumes of motor fuel is remarkably inefficient. It is devilishly difficult to break down cellulose into materials that can be fermented into alcohol. And even if that process were somehow made easier, its environmental effects have also been called into question. A September 2008 study on alternative automotive fuels done by Jan Kreider, a professor emeritus of engineering at the University of Colorado, and Peter S. Curtiss, a Boulder-based engineer, found that the production of cellulosic ethanol required about 42 times as much water and emitted about 50 percent more carbon dioxide than standard gasoline. Furthermore, Kreider and Curtiss found that, as with corn ethanol, the amount of energy that could be gained by producing cellulosic ethanol was negligible.</p> \n\n<p>In a recent interview, Kreider told me that the key problem with turning cellulose into fuel is &#8220;that it&#8217;s such a dilute energy form. Coal and gasoline, dirty as they may be, are concentrated forms of energy. Hauling around biomass makes no sense.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Indeed, the volumes of biomass needed to make any kind of dent in America&#8217;s overall energy needs are mind boggling. Let&#8217;s assume that the U.S. wants to replace 10 percent of its oil use with cellulosic ethanol. That&#8217;s a useful percentage as it&#8217;s approximately equal to the percentage of U.S. oil consumption that originates in the Persian Gulf. Let&#8217;s further assume that the U.S. decides that switchgrass is the most viable option for producing cellulosic ethanol.</p> \n\n<p>Given those assumptions, here&#8217;s the math: The U.S. consumes about 21 million barrels of oil per day, or about 320 billion gallons of oil per year. New ethanol companies like Coskata and Syntec are claiming that they can produce about 100 gallons of ethanol per ton of biomass, which is also about the same yield that can be garnered by using grain as a feedstock.</p> \n\n<p>At 100 gallons per ton, producing 32 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol would require the annual harvest and transport of 320 million tons of biomass. Assuming an average semi-trailer holds 15 tons of biomass, that volume of biomass would fill 21.44 million semi-trailer loads. If each trailer is a standard 48 feet long, the column of trailers (not including any trucks attached to them) holding that amount of switchgrass would stretch almost 195,000 miles. That&#8217;s long enough to encircle the earth nearly eight times. Put another way, those trailers would stretch about 80 percent of the distance from the earth to the moon.</p> \n\n<p>But remember, ethanol&#8217;s energy density is only about two-thirds that of gasoline. So that 32 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol only contains the energy equivalent of about 21 billion gallons of gasoline. Thus, the U.S. would actually need to produce about 42.5 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol in order to supplant 10 percent of its oil needs. That would necessitate the production of 425 million tons of biomass, enough to fill about 28.3 million trailers. And that line of semi-trailer loads that stretch about 257,500 miles, plenty long enough to loop around the earth more than 10 times, or to stretch from the Earth to the Moon.</p> \n\n<p>But let&#8217;s continue driving down this road for another mile or two. Sure, it&#8217;s possible to produce that much biomass, but how much land would be required to make it happen? Well, a report from Oak Ridge National Laboratory suggests that an acre of switchgrass can yield about 11.5 tons of biomass per year, and thus, in theory, 1,150 gallons of ethanol per year.</p> \n\n<p>Therefore, to produce 425 million tons of biomass from switchgrass would require some 36.9 million acres to be planted in nothing but switchgrass. That&#8217;s equal to about 57,700 square miles, or an area just a little smaller than the state Oklahoma. For comparison, that 36.9 million acres is equal to about 8 percent of all the cropland now under cultivation in the U.S. Thus, to get 10 percent of its oil needs, the U.S. would need to plant an area equal to 8 percent of its cropland.</p> \n\n<p>And none of that consider the fact that there&#8217;s no infrastructure available to plant, harvest, and transport the switchgrass or other biomass source to the biorefinery.</p> \n\n<p>So just to review: There are still no companies producing cellulosic ethanol on a commercial basis.

It keeps saying things that surprise both proprietor and hearer and in two recent cases its utterances were completely unexpected and, indeed, unwelcomed, suggesting as they did, a bigotry to which neither of the tongues&#8217; proprietors acknowledges subscribing. In mid-October their tongues separately took off with startling pronouncements. The first came from the tongue of former Nobel Prize winner, James D. Watson.</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Watson received the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1962 for deciphering the double Helix of DNA. In 2007 his tongue entered new territory. Echoing sentiments of an earlier Nobel Prize winner it made a pronouncement both startling and racist. Mr. Watson&#8217;s errant tongue expressed gloominess at the prospect for a solution to the myriad problems facing Africa. It was quoted in the Times of London as saying that its master was &#8220;inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa&#8221; even though &#8220;there are many people of color who are very talented.&#8221; Elucidating, it explained &#8220;All our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours-whereas all the testing says not really.&#8221; Such a pronouncement is startling at any time but being made when the free world is led by a madman of diminished mental capacity, surrounded by advisors of equal intellect, it is all the more startling.</p> \n\n<p>Happily for Mr. Watson and his admirers, when informed of his tongue&#8217;s wanderings, he promptly disavowed its utterances, thus redeeming himself. In a statement to the Associated Press he said:</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I cannot understand how I could have said what I am quoted as having said. There is no scientific basis for such a belief.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>(Imagine George Bush disavowing his tongue&#8217;s utterances that there were weapons of mass destruction, things were going better in Iraq, etc.)</p> \n\n<p>(This was not the first time that a Nobel Prize winner&#8217;s tongue assumed its master&#8217;s award gave it license to make racist utterances. William B. Shockley, a Nobel laureate who received the prize in physics for his work with transistors, eventually left the world of physics and began teaching at Stanford University where he formulated a theory that led him to promulgate the idea that African Americans were inherently less intelligent than Caucasians, a theory never disavowed by him and one that took considerable luster from the medal he had received as a Nobel prize winner. )</p> \n\n<p>A day after Mr. Watson spoke, the tongue of another prominent American took flight and with an oratorical flourish that gave life insurance companies information that should increase their profits, denigrated minorities. The tongue took off while John Tanner, chief of the Justice Department&#8217;s civil rights division, was making a speech to the National Latino Congreso in Los Angeles. One of Mr. Tanner&#8217;s responsibilities in the Justice Department is the protection of citizens&#8217; voting rights, The tongue, whose master had recently expressed support for a Georgia law that requires voters to show identification cards before voting, told the Latino audience that a disproportionate share of elderly minority voters did not have identification cards. Acknowledging that that was a problem for them, according to reports of a video posted on YouTube, the tongue went on to say: &#8220;That&#8217;s a shame, you know, creating problems for elderly persons just is not good under any circumstances&#8221; Continuing, but not making matters better, it went on to say: &#8220;Of course, that also ties into the racial aspect because our society is such that minorities don&#8217;t become elderly the way white people do. They die first.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The tongue then explained that there are lots of inequities in the U.S. and anything that &#8220;disproportionately impacts the elderly has the opposite impact on minorities. Just the math is such as that.&#8221; That was a startling bit of information for the tongue to impart and it is unlikely that the utterance will qualify Mr. Tanner or his tongue for a Nobel Prize. (It may affect premiums paid by minorities for life insurance since if the companies are aware that minorities have shorter life expectancies than non-minorities the premiums minorities pay for life insurance will almost certainly be higher than those paid by insureds with longer life expectancies. Quoting Mr. Tanner&#8217;s tongue: &#8220;Just the math is such as that.&#8221;)</p> \n\n<p>Given the opportunity to disavow the tongue&#8217;s utterances, a Justice Department spokesman said Mr. Tanner&#8217;s remarks had been &#8220;grossly misconstrued.&#8221; He went on to explain that &#8220;nothing in his comments deviated from his firm commitment to enforce the law.&#8221; That may be, although Mr. Tanner&#8217;s support for Georgia&#8217;s voter identification law would suggest he and his tongue are not as out of synch as supporters of voting rights would have had a right to expect from the chief of the Justice Department&#8217;s civil rights division.</p> \n\n<p>CHRISTOPHER BRAUCHLI is a laywer in Boulder, Colorado.

Most movies with blue collar characters are, unfortunately, about something else: giant robots, dinosaurs, natural disasters, man-made disasters, plane crashes, racial issues (\"Fences\"), grief and family dysfunction (\"Manchester\")&#8230; That is not a complaint on my part. Oftentimes these everyday men are the heroes of the story, and that's a wonderful thing.</p> \n\n<p>But where are the movies that portray blue collar America as it is, their \"voice,\" as Pratt correctly put it? Where are the movies that show the everyday heroism and dignity in the work that these men and women do, the contentment of their lives, the importance of their role in our world?</p> \n\n<p>Hollywood was once rife with stories about farmers, oil workers, builders, coal miners, truck drivers, factory workers -- the working class wasn't just represented as a means to tell a bigger story, they were the story in the same way movies about teachers today celebrate teaching and teachers, in the same way that movies today about scientists and artists and political activists and journalists celebrate who those people are and the importance of what they do.</p> \n\n<p>When is the last time a movie about blue collar American reminded us that these are the people who grow and deliver our food, who keep our lights on, our toilets flushing, our cars on the road, our trash picked up, our sewage invisible, our meat slaughtered, our roofs repaired and our streets paved?</p> \n\n<p>Name the last movie you saw that told the truth about blue collar America -- that without them our way of life would cease to exist in a matter of days.</p> \n\n<p>Every opportunity I have to make this point, I do: If I went away tomorrow, some people might miss my work but the world would keep right on turning.

The &#8216;sadistic, blatant, and wanton criminal abuses&#8217; found by Major General Taguba has a long history within the tradition of US imperial policing of third world nations. The primary means for this policing had traditionally been counter-insurgency warfare which has always sought to contain and destroy social forces considered inimical to US interests. Given the fragile social base of the US occupation in Iraq coupled with the increasing ferocity of the Iraqi resistance it comes as little surprise that the US has turned to counter-insurgency warfare to help it undermine and destroy resistance to its rule. The reports and pictures coming out of Abu Ghraib merely confirm what has long been a legitimate tactic within US counter-insurgency warfare: the targeting and torture of civilians. This terror serves not only to break the will of those targeted but has a wider symbolic psychological function in that it dramatically raises the cost of dissent. Whether it is was a &#8216;war on communism&#8217; during the Cold War, or a &#8216;war on terrorism&#8217; in the post-9/11 era, the targets and tactics have remained the same and the abuses at Abu Ghraib are the logical outcome of what the US has long been teaching both its own counter-insurgency specialists and those of allied nations. This functional use of terror and torture becomes clearer when we examine the very manuals used by US counter-insurgency warfare experts to train others in the art of &#8216;unconventional warfare&#8217;. For example, in one US counter-insurgency manual called Psychological Operations the manual argued that the primary target &#8216;for tactical psychological operations is the local civilian population&#8217;.1 After other means have failed, the manual stated pro-US forces can legitimately target civilians to instil terror:</p> \n\n<p>Civilians in the operational area may be supporting their own government or collaborating with an enemy occupation force. Themes and appeals disseminated to this group will vary accordingly, but the psychological objectives will be the same as those for the enemy military. An isolation program designed to instil doubt and fear may be carried out &#8230; If these programs fail, it may become necessary to take more aggressive action in the form of harsh treatment or even abductions. The abduction and harsh treatment of key enemy civilians can weaken the collaborators&#8217; belief in the strength and power of their military forces.2</p> \n\n<p>Another manual, entitled Handling Sources, continued along similar lines and advocated the harsh treatment of civilians. The manual was used to teach CI forces the art of cultivating government informants within alleged insurgent organisations. The manual states that good techniques to force people to inform were the targeting of family members and the use of physical violence. The &#8216;CI agent could cause the arrest of the employee&#8217;s parents, imprison the employee or give him a beating as part of the placement plan of said employee in the guerrilla organization&#8217;.3 The manual went on to outline how crucial successful informants are, with an informant&#8217;s worth increasing through the number of &#8216;arrests, executions, or pacification[s]&#8217; the informants information led to, all the while &#8216;taking care not to expose the employee as the information source.&#8217;4 According to the manual even children were to be used as potential information sources: &#8216;Children are, at least, very observant and can provide precise information about things they have seen and heard, if they are interrogated in the appropriate manner&#8217;.5 The use of state terror was thus overtly advocated as a legitimate technique to be employed by counter-insurgency forces, with recipient militaries trained in the use of terrorism and the &#8216;abduction and harsh treatment&#8217; of civilians advocated so as to raise the associated costs of dissent.</p> \n\n<p>One of the key features of US-backed throughout the third world was the institutionalisation of torture against perceived enemies with torture practised routinely and on a wide scale by US-backed counter-insurgency forces.6 The use of coercive techniques as part of the overall counter-insurgency effort were advocated by US trainers and physical and mental coercion was openly advocated as a legitimate part of the counterinsurgents arsenal. For example, in the CIA&#8217;s Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual, it was stated that although US trainers &#8216;do not stress the use of coercive techniques, we do want to make you aware of them and the proper way to use them&#8217;. The manual outlines a number of coercive techniques including sensory deprivation, solitary confinement and different forms of physical torture including bizarre forms of water torture whereby subjects were &#8216;suspended in water and wore black-out masks&#8217;. The manual continues that the</p> \n\n<p>stress and anxiety become unbearable for most subjects &#8230; how much they are able to stand depends upon the psychological characteristics of the individual &#8230; the &#8216;questioner&#8217; can take advantage of this relationship by assuming a benevolent role.7</p> \n\n<p>The manual cautioned that if a &#8216;subject refuses to comply once a threat has been made, it must be carried out. If it is not carried out then subsequent threats will also prove ineffective&#8217;. The training manual concludes that &#8216;there are a few non-coercive techniques which can be used to induce regression, but to a lesser degree than can be obtained with coercive techniques&#8217;.8 This manual was based on an earlier manual used by the CIA. The older manual was called the KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation Manual and dates from 1963. In its introduction, the manual states that if bodily harm or &#8216;medical, chemical or electrical methods or materials are to be used to induce acquiescence&#8217; then prior approval from CIA headquarters is required. The manual continues that if &#8216;a new safehouse is to be used as the interrogation site, it should be studied carefully to be sure that the total environment can be manipulated as desired. For example, the electric current should be known in advance, so that transformers or other modifying devices will be on hand if needed&#8217;.9 The Baltimore Sun conducted an investigation into the use of these manuals. They were told by an intelligence source that the &#8216;CIA has acknowledged privately and informally in the past that this referred to the application of electric shocks to interrogation suspects&#8217;.10 In sum, torture was condoned as part of the strategic arsenal available to counter-insurgency forces in combating alleged subversion. Importantly, torture not only provided an efficient means for inducing &#8216;regression&#8217; but also acted to instil terror within target populations. The abuses committed at Abu Ghraib thus form part of a covert tradition within the history of US imperial policing and counter-insurgency warfare.</p> \n\n<p>Dr. DOUG STOKES is a lecturer in International Politics.

The former long-time CEO of American International Group (NYSE:AIG) and now CEO of Starr International has been a pioneer in expanding insurance operations across the globe.</p> \n\n<p>AIG, for instance, has a large presence in China thanks to Greenberg&#8217;s work with government officials, beginning in the mid 1970s.</p> \n\n<p>Greenberg said that Starr is looking at possible insurance opportunities as American tourism companies expand in Cuba, though he added that he doesn&#8217;t see any short-term business dealings given the nature of the normalization process, which will likely be phased in over a number of years.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s going to be more tourism, so there might be a business opportunity for us,&#8221; said Greenberg who declined to name the government officials he met with during his one-day trip.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Starr already owns a business known as Assist-Card, which offers insurance to people who want to travel to Cuba. But Greenberg confirmed that his trip involved broader discussions about possibly expanding other areas of Starr&#8217;s insurance business such as providing insurance for hotels.</p> \n\n<p>Since President Obama announced that he was taking the first steps toward ending a 55-year economic blockade of the Cuba that began after the 1959 Cuban revolution, American businesses have been eyeing the business possibilities there.</p> \n\n<p>American tourism-related business has a particularly keen interest in expanding in the island nation, though many are finding it easier said than done. For starters, the trade embargo still exists, and companies will have to deal with layers of laws and regulations from the U.S. and the Cuban governments to do business.</p> \n\n<p>For instance, Hilton Worldwide Holdings (NYSE:HLT) has been observing the changes in U.S.-Cuban economic policy since the president announced his intentions to normalize relations in December of last year.</p> \n\n<p>But the hotel company has yet to formally engage the Cuban government to expand its presence, and the closest it has come to doing so will be when Hilton officials take part in a cultural mission with other business leaders and travel to Cuban toward the end of the year, a person with knowledge of the matter says.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The embargo still exists so there&#8217;s not much Hilton can do,&#8221; said one person with knowledge of the matter.</p> \n\n<p>A Hilton spokesman had no comment.</p> \n\n<p>Despite these obstacles, many businesses are looking at Cuba as the next big growth opportunity. Beginning on July 3, Jet Blue (NASDAQ:JBLU) will fly from JFK Airport in New York to Havana.

It remains unclear if the cuts will be averted.</p> \n\n<p>Croswell said he expected negotiations about the sixth F-35 engine contract to proceed more quickly than the last time since Pratt had already signed a $65 million agreement with the Pentagon on maintenance of those planes.</p> \n\n<p>The company also agreed to shoulder 100 percent of any cost overruns on the fifth batch of engines, which meant there was less new ground to cover in the next contract, he said.</p> \n\n<p>Pratt reached agreement with the Pentagon last month on the fifth batch of jet engines to power 29 jets and three spares, a deal that lowered the cost of the engines by 5.5 percent.</p> \n\n<p>Croswell said the company expected to lower costs further in the sixth batch, although he declined to say by how much.

Besides the fact it&#8217;s kind of like The Beatles saying they&#8217;re reuniting and playing all of Revolver, there are at least three more reasons this is cool:</p> \n\n<p>1. Bringin&#8217; it back. This album came out 19 years ago! I (thank God) and most people I know were barely out of our New Wave diapers at that point. Could we have been expected to cut English class and go to New York to see Sonic Youth perform these songs? No we could not. So, now we get our chance.</p> \n\n<p>2. Slow on the uptake. More than almost any band, Sonic Youth makes music that rewards repeated listenings over time. My first exposure to der Yoof was seeing &#8220;Shadow of a Doubt,&#8221; an uncharateristically pretty song, on MTV&#8217;s &#8220;120 Minutes&#8221; back in 1986. I bought the album (EVOL), but my poor 15-year-old ears weren&#8217;t really ready for the rest of it. It was only a couple years later (after some stoned viewings of the full-length video to 1990&#8217;s Goo) that I went back and realized how great the other albums were. As life goes by and, ahem, &#8220;takes its crazy toll&#8221; (I&#8217;m quoting them), Daydream Nation means different things to me.</p> \n\n<p>3. Well-adjusted. While Sonic Youth has, in the past few years, delved into obscure, avant-garde experimentalism, their latest album, Rather Ripped, proved they don&#8217;t mind sounding like the band they were 15 years ago, either. Unlike, say, Radiohead, whose neurotic relationship with their own musical past means you won&#8217;t ever see them perform &#8220;Creep,&#8221; Thurston, Kim &amp;amp; crew seem to like their old songs. At the &#8220;Ain&#8217;t No Picnic&#8221; festival outside of LA in 1999, all the band&#8217;s gear <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/alt.music.sonic-youth/browse_thread/thread/179488b9b5ee2331/7270ff8994e508c4\" type=\"external\">was stolen</a>, including their uniquely tuned guitars. But instead of cancelling, they borrowed Sleater-Kinney&#8217;s gear and performed a set of &#8220;classics,&#8221; which turned out to be one of the highlights of my concert-going life (snif).

Ingmar&#8217;s fully informed about my slightly spastic condition and I can tell he&#8217;s not sure if I can still do this. I give him a thumbs up and start up the rope.</p> \n\n<p>By the time the camera crews arrive, we&#8217;re both up on the platform with our feet dangling down. The cameras focus in as Ingmar rappels down the rope. I stay up in the tree. The CH TV guy comes over with a microphone and battery pack and attaches them to the end of the rope. I haul the rope up and clip the mike to my coat collar. The reporter calls her questions up to me and I shout back down at her, forgetting about the mike.</p> \n\n<p>The reporters and cameras finally leave and I&#8217;m alone up in the tree. The platform is a pair of four by eight foot plywood sheets reinforced with two by fours. It looks like a raft on the open ocean. Ropes and rigging are everywhere and the white tarps billow in the wind like sails. The plywood planks are not quite level and they creak and sway as I move around.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s a two-room platform: one plank is the bedroom, with a tiny tent nailed to it. The other serves as the living room (a folding chair) and kitchen (a camp stove and a pot). The bathroom is a bucket hanging below the tree-sit. Everything is lashed down or clipped in, but things fall overboard anyway: two pens, my lighter, the lid to my thermos.</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;m tied to the tree on a ten-foot leash tethered to my harness that stays on every moment, even when I&#8217;m sleeping. The thing wraps itself around my legs every time I turn around and threatens to knock small untethered objects off the platform.</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;m afraid of falling. Everyone is; people are hardwired that way. Even though I have total confidence in the platform and the safety line, that giddy feeling comes and goes, especially when I&#8217;m moving around close to the edge or getting ready to descend down the rope.</p> \n\n<p>There&#8217;s a constant wind up here and the roar of traffic is louder. Through the trees to the south I can just make out a bare knoll and the entrance to the Langford Cave, a 40-meter-long karst cavity that draws cavers from all over the region.</p> \n\n<p>The Songhees First Nation named this place Spaet Mountain. The city of Langford calls it Skirt Mountain. The developer has re-named it Bear Mountain togo along with the marketing of their resort and property sales.</p> \n\n<p>A pileated woodpecker flies into the grove of dead snags next to the platform and lands on a trunk at eye level. It hammers away at the wood for a few moments and then swoops over the trail and up a rotten stump. A hummingbird zips by, flashing green. The forest floor is carpeted with trillium and lilies.</p> \n\n<p>As night falls, the traffic dies down and the frogs start up. The tree sways slightly in the wind and the thrushes sing their evening songs. I crawl into the tiny tent and curl up in my sleeping bag, tugging at the tether every time I turn over. Waking up in the middle of the night, I hear an owl hooting.</p> \n\n<p>Thursday morning I wake up with the sun shining through the trees and a winter wren scolding me nearby. I crawl out of my cocoon, bleary-eyed, and go through the routine of making a pot of tea, taking a shit in the bucket, rolling a cigarette and surveying the forest. I feel wonderful.</p> \n\n<p>People come to visit: local supporters, more journalists, and curious neighbours. Food donations are piling up under a tarp Ingmar tied up for a base camp. The food has to be dealt with because there are raccoons (and possibly bears) in the area, so I haul it up to the platform and make a space in a gear bag for cans of soup, noodles, oatmeal, and cookies.</p> \n\n<p>Cheryl Bryce, the lands manager for the Songhees First Nation, stops by to lend her support and videotape the tree-sit. She&#8217;s disturbed that some members of the band council are supporting the development rather than voting to protect the environmental values of their traditional territory. I come down the rope and we chat for a half an hour.</p> \n\n<p>The clouds gather and an icy wind picks up. I go to bed early, snuggled down in the bottom of the sleeping bag with an extra fleece blanket.</p> \n\n<p>Friday dawns with threatening clouds. Then a threatening little man with a mustache: the lands manager for the Provincial Capitol Commission. He&#8217;s been sent to determine whether I&#8217;m on PCC land, and to grumble at me about the commission&#8217;s liability if someone gets hurt and sues them. I promise I won&#8217;t hurt anybody and I won&#8217;t sue anybody. He suggests if I&#8217;m trespassing, he may get the police involved. I invite him to the salmon barbecue scheduled for later tonight. He studies me for a minute without responding and then marches off into the forest with his maps in hand.</p> \n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if he&#8217;ll call the police, but even if they show up, they won&#8217;t be able to arrest me because I&#8217;m sixty feet up in a tree. The RCMP in Vancouver has a special climbing team for these kind of situations, but it takes a few days to assemble. I contemplate the legal implications of criminal trespass charges and court injunctions.</p> \n\n<p>Later: I&#8217;m bored, so I use my borrowed cell phone to call the developers&#8217; head office. Bear Mountain Resort and Bear Mountain Properties are the forces behind this project and I figure it&#8217;s only polite to introduce myself. But it seems no one is available on this Friday afternoon, not even a receptionist, so I leave a cheery message in the general mailbox describing the wildlife in the area and inviting them all to the salmon barbecue.</p> \n\n<p>The rain holds off, miraculously. At dinnertime, three dozen tree-huggers are gathered around a small campfire devouring barbecued salmon, roasted weiners, mashed potatoes, and bags of fruit and cookies. Mary Vickers, a Nuxalk Nation woman from Bella Bella, provided the salmon, and she gets us all to join hands while she says a prayer to the spirits and the ancestors to bless our work here. Ingmar stands up on a stump and lays out the plan: seven people are needed to take charge of the tree-sit for one day a week. Each person would either sit in the tree for twenty-four hours or find another person to do it. He&#8217;ll provide the training.</p> \n\n<p>By Saturday, I&#8217;m thoroughly weary of the tiny platform, the harness, and the shit bucket. My legs and arms are shaky from climbing up and down the rope. I&#8217;m longing for a hot shower and a soft bed. But still I sit for hours mesmerized, staring out into the forest, listening to the birds, and feeling my senses expand to the limit of hearing and vision.</p> \n\n<p>On Sunday morning, the relief shift arrives. Keith lives nearby and he has no idea how to climb a tree, but he&#8217;s willing to learn and Ingmar&#8217;s willing to teach him. I rappel down for the last time. My man Dan is there to give me a ride home.</p> \n\n<p>I don&#8217;t want folks to get the idea that I&#8217;m some kind of action hero. I&#8217;m retired from all that now. This was just a one-time special event&#8211;more of a vacation than an action; more of a cameo than a comeback. I joked with the folks watching me climb that I&#8217;m living proof: almost anyone can do this shit. And it&#8217;s true&#8211;the biggest obstacle is conquering the fear of falling, the fear of failing, the fear of powerlessness. The campaign is just now beginning, but folks are digging in for the long haul. Cheers to the Spaet Mountain defenders!</p> \n\n<p>ZOE BLUNT writes for <a href=\"http://www.Lowbagger.com/\" type=\"external\">Lowbagger.com</a>.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "Tales from the Tree Tops", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2007/05/23/tales-from-the-tree-tops/", "published_at": "2007-05-23", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Though developing solid business skills is a key component of growing your career, <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/careers/2017/08/16/3-reasons-people-are-more-important-than-your-degr.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=7ff3fb88-adc6-11e7-8484-0050569d32b9&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">networking Opens a New Window.</a> is equally important, if not more so. When you connect with the right people, you open the door to new opportunities and get to learn from their experiences. The problem, however, is that some folks struggle to network more so than others. <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/careers/2017/07/04/the-best-jobs-for-introverts.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=7ff3fb88-adc6-11e7-8484-0050569d32b9&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Introverts Opens a New Window.</a>, in fact, often dread the idea of networking, so much so that they avoid it completely.</p> \n\n<p>Now let's be clear: Being an introvert in no way implies that you're devoid of social skills. There are plenty of introverts who make great leaders and have active social lives to boot. At the same time, introverts tend to crave alone time, and often feel overwhelmed when faced with the notion of having to be \"on\" for extended periods of time. This can make networking difficult to varying degrees.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>For example, as an introvert, you might pass up an industry party if the idea of attending makes you antsy. In doing so, however, you could end up missing out on a key opportunity to connect with people who can help your career.</p> \n\n<p>That said, you can be a natural introvert and still do a good job of networking. You may just need to tweak your approach. Here's how.</p> \n\n<p>Introverts don't always do well in large crowds. If the thought of attending a bustling industry conference intimidates you, try building relationships by sitting down with contacts individually and getting to know them in a more subdued environment, like a quiet cafe or restaurant. Having trouble meeting those people in the first place? Ask your existing associates to introduce you, or reach out via sites like <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/careers/2017/08/06/5-ways-to-use-linkedin-to-get-a-job.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=7ff3fb88-adc6-11e7-8484-0050569d32b9&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">LinkedIn Opens a New Window.</a> to make contact directly. Establishing your network one person at a time might make the process less daunting.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Though plenty of introverts are happy to network in person, if face-to-face interactions happen to make you uneasy, try reaching out to new associates by phone or by email. Some people find it easier to let their personalities shine through in writing, as opposed to live discussions, so if you're the type who tends to clam up on the spot, consider going the email route.</p> \n\n<p>Networking isn't the sort of thing you do sporadically. Rather, it's something you should focus on consistently. That's why it's important to do so in a manner that doesn't turn you off. Knowing what parameters you're comfortable with will help you develop your own personalized approach to networking. For example, if you're at a conference, you may want to take breaks to retreat back to your hotel room between sessions or skip the group dinner if, after eight hours of nonstop interaction, you've simply had enough. Similarly, if you're at an industry happy hour and the crowd starts building, pick up and leave before the room really gets packed. Being aware of your limits will help ensure that you don't give up on networking when the going gets a bit tougher.</p> \n\n<p>Successful networking doesn't necessarily mean building the largest business network; rather, it's a matter of building the right network. Instead of aiming to amass a certain number of contacts, focus on developing strong relationships with a few key people who can help grow your career and serve as resources as needed. Not only might this align better with your personality, but it'll also help you network more efficiently.</p> \n\n<p>For better or worse, networking is an essential part of moving up in the business world and advancing your career. Rather than let your personality hinder your networking efforts, use it to your advantage. Introverts tend to be great listeners, and that's something others are sure to value. If you focus on your strengths and do things on your own terms, you'll be well on your way to building a solid network that proves valuable in more ways than one.</p> \n\n<p>The $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

Ultimately Congress must decide whether such a transformational restructuring of our financial system is justified in order to mitigate the ongoing risks posed by large banks.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Among the solutions he floated: &#8220;breaking up large banks into smaller, less connected, less important entities&#8221; and &#8220;turning large banks into public utilities by forcing them to hold so much capital that they virtually can&#8217;t fail (with regulation akin to that of a nuclear power plant).&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>While Kashkari acknowledged that the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law has made &#8220;significant progress&#8221; in strengthening the financial system, he said it &#8220;did not go far enough&#8221; and warned that &#8220;we won&#8217;t see the next crisis coming, and it won&#8217;t look like what we might be expecting.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Kashkari, who was the 2014 Republican nominee for California governor, also expressed skepticism about whether regulatory tools created in the wake of the bailout &#8220;will be useful to policymakers in the&#8230;scenario of a stressed economic environment.&#8221; He said:</p> \n\n<p>Given the massive externalities on Main Street of large bank failures in terms of lost jobs, lost income and lost wealth, no rational policymaker would risk restructuring large firms and forcing losses on creditors and counterparties using the new tools in a risky environment, let alone in a crisis environment like we experienced in 2008. They will be forced to bail out failing institutions&#8212;as we were. We were even forced to support large bank mergers, which helped stabilize the immediate crisis, but that we knew would make TBTF worse in the long term. The risks to the U.S. economy and the American people were simply too great not to do whatever we could to prevent a financial collapse.</p> \n\n<p>As the Guardian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/16/finacial-crash-bank-bailout-2008-neel-kashkari-us-banks-too-big-to-fail\" type=\"external\">notes</a>, Kashkari&#8217;s comments &#8220;come as presidential candidates battle over whom has the best solution to prevent another banking crisis, and prevent a repeat of the economic collapse.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;There are lines in your speech that I can imagine Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren saying,&#8221; David Wessel, director of Brookings&#8217; Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, told Kashkari during a panel discussion after the speech.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m not willing to stand up and share my concerns, then I wouldn&#8217;t be doing my job,&#8221; Kashkari responded.</p>", "title": "Unlikely Critic Neel Kashkari Says Banks Still Pose 'Nuclear' Risk to U.S. Economy", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/unlikely-critic-neel-kashkari-says-banks-still-pose-nuclear-risk-to-u-s-economy/", "published_at": "2016-02-17", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Hiring military veterans is good for business, according to a new study.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Conducted by the Washington think tank <a href=\"http://www.cnas.org\" type=\"external\">Center for a New American Security Opens a New Window.</a>, the study uncovers why companies hire veterans and the challenges they face in doing so.</p> \n\n<p>The 69 businesses examined, including AT&amp;amp;T, Bank of America, the Boeing Co., Kraft Foods and PepsiCo, provided a number of reasons behind their <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/1661-veteran-employment.html\" type=\"external\">decision to hire veterans Opens a New Window.</a>, including:</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2574-jobs-veterans.html\" type=\"external\">[Best Companies for Veterans to Work For] Opens a New Window.</a></p> \n\n<p>Despite the numerous benefits of hiring veterans, the research also revealed several reasons why so many <a href=\"http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/2169-military-job-prospects.html\" type=\"external\">veterans remain unemployed Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>The study by the CNAS, a developer of defense policy proposals, points to a number of ways the Department of Defense and the Department of Labor can increase veteran hiring.

They are both in love with a set of ideals or dreams that they sought to bring to life. They are both iconic, and their iconic statuses conjure feelings from both ends of the emotional spectrum.

Now as Americans celebrate the death of Osama Bin Laden, they should really be contemplating the consequences of the governments they elect to occupy the White House, and the non-American lives they are guilty, directly or indirectly, of taking.

Though Democrats have certainly used force in the past, as with Bill Clinton&#8217;s mission in Kosovo and Bosnia, &#8220;barely anyone remembers those missions.&#8221; Beinart highlights the fact that back in 2001, George W. Bush sent only Afghan troops into Tora Bora&#8212;and Bin Laden escaped, whereas Obama sent a force of only Americans, whoc succeeded. Bin Laden&#8217;s killing also debunks the claim that Democrats rely too heavily on international institutions and are slaves to international law. This was already proven false&#8212;Clinton&#8217;s war in Kosovo lacked U.N. approval. Another claim that bin Laden&#8217;s killing will shred is that Democrats do not get along with the military. Beinart says Obama &#8220;is now fused in the public imagination with the most successful American mission since Inchon.&#8221; According to Beinart, for these reasons, Obama has finally liberated the Democrats from decades of unfair abuse.</p> \n\n<p>Death of a &#8220;Moral Monster&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In Gawker, <a href=\"http://gawker.com/#!5797732/sometimes-a-little-bloodlust-is-in-order\" type=\"external\">John Cook</a> says Americans should not be ashamed for rejoicing and celebrating upon hearing of the demise of Osama bin Laden. While this celebrating has come under criticism by many columnists, Cook says it is entirely appropriate behavior. He says, &#8220;Moral clarity is a rare gift&#8230;Osama Bin Laden is a moral monster of the highest order, with gallons of blood on his hands, and he earned his fate in spades.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Deadly, Two-Faced Pakistan</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2011/05/02/salman-rushdie-pakistans-deadly-game.html\" type=\"external\">Salman Rushdie</a> complains that it is inconceivable that Pakistan did not know Osama bin Laden was hiding in a mansion in Abbottabad. He was almost hiding in plain sight, 800 yards from the military academy, in a large house with no Internet or telephone. It is very unlikely that no Pakistani authorities knew he was there. Rushdie argues that this fits into a general pattern of Pakistan&#8217;s deceptions and that Pakistanis have been playing a double game in the fight against terrorism. Rushdie writes, &#8220;perhaps it is time to declare it [Pakistan] a terrorist state and expel it from the comity of nations.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Not Quite a Triumph</p> \n\n<p>Ross Douthat argued in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/opinion/02douthat.html?ref=rossdouthat\" type=\"external\">The New York Times</a> that we overreacted in our fears after 9/11, &#8220;and what seemed like the horrifying opening offensive in a new and terrifying war stands instead as an isolated case.&#8221; The 10 years that have elapsed since then without any significant terrorist attacks have shown that we did not need to fear Osama bin Laden, and al Qaeda were not the force that we thought they were. So, while the death of Osama bin Laden is &#8220;a triumph for the United States of America&#8230;it is not quite the triumph it would have been if bin Laden had been captured a decade ago, because those 10 years have taught us that we didn&#8217;t need to fear him and his rabble as much as we thought wet did.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.</p> \n\n<p>A speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).</p> \n\n<p>Don&#8217;t Get Cocky, America</p> \n\n<p>Daveed Garterstein-Ross says that while the killing of Osama bin Laden is a blow to al Qaeda, the organization still poses a significant threat. Bin Laden&#8217;s experience fighting the Soviet Union in Afghanistan taught him the importance of economy; he watched the Soviet Union continue to fight until it ran out of money, and then he watched it collapse soon after. He thought these were completely linked. In 2004, he remarked that his organization was doing the same to the U.S, saying &#8220;continuing this policy is bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy.&#8221; In 2010, after a plot to put ink cartridges on planes, a Qaeda publication boasted that even though the plot did not kill anyone, it was still a success, because it meant &#8220;billions of dollars in new security measures&#8221; for America.&#8221; Garterstein-Ross argues that had U.S. officials understood this goal of bleeding America to collapse, they might have been more resistant to declaring a victory in Afghanistan and moving ahead with the invasion of Iraq. Garterstein-Ross warns of the dangers of similarly declaring victory in the <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/05/02/dont_get_cocky_america?page=0,0gm\" type=\"external\">war on terror</a>.</p> \n\n<p>The New War to End All Wars?</p> \n\n<p>Is the death of bin Laden a meaningless milestone in a needless war? <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-hochschild-war-20110503,0,5916760.story\" type=\"external\">Adam Hochschild</a>, author of To End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914-1918, examines the similarities between the Iraq and Afghan wars and World War I. While the Iraq War has some of the most obvious comparisons&#8212;the flimsy excuses for war, the mistaken belief in quick victory&#8212;Hochschild writes that there are some important similarities between the war to end all wars and the Afghan war, too. While Hochschild does not deny the U.S.&#8217;s justification to enter Afghanistan in 2001, there is still the undeniable fact that many more Afghan civilians have died since the invasion, he argues. &#8220;Someday, I have no doubt, the dead from today&#8217;s wars will be seen with a similar sense of sorrow as needless loss and folly as those millions of men who lie in the vast military cemeteries that spread along the old front line in France and Belgium&#8212;and tens of millions of Americans will feel a similar revulsion for the politicians and generals who were so spendthrift with other&#8217;s lives,&#8221; Hochschild writes.</p> \n\n<p>How to Break the al Qaeda Franchise</p> \n\n<p>Now that bin Laden is dead, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c2cc1372-74ee-11e0-a4b7-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1LJ8LL6jy\" type=\"external\">Ahmed Rashid</a> writes in the Financial Times that Muslim leaders need to seize this opportunity to show once and for all it is possible to live freely without the burden of extremism.

Toobin notes that &#8220;no one is shedding any tears about bin Laden&#8217;s death,&#8221; but that his death did ignore the political assassination ban. &#8220;It is, to put it mildly, an easy power to abuse &#8230; but the number of people for whom that is true is small.&#8221; Bin Laden Was &#8220;Enormously Successful&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Given bin Laden&#8217;s death, and the fractured terrorist network he left behind, does it make sense to say he was &#8220;enormously successful&#8221;? <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/osama-bin-laden-didnt-win-but-he-was-enormously-successful/2011/05/02/AFexZjbF_story.html\" type=\"external\">Ezra Klein</a> writes that the trillions the U.S. has spent on the overseas wars and national security have severely hurt the U.S. economy&#8212;part of bin Laden&#8217;s plan for the America.

One out of four was right. Guess which one?]</p> \n\n<p>Hannity &amp;amp; Colmes</p> \n\n<p>April 12, 2002</p> \n\n<p>COLMES: Joining us tonight is Florida Congressman Mark Foley and Wayne Madsen, an investigative journalist who has worked with Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney for three years.</p> \n\n<p>Now, before I defend Cynthia McKinney&#8217;s right to say what she said, Mr. Madsen, would you agree that to suggest that the United States or anybody in this country knew or &#8212; in the government had advance knowledge of this is preposterous?</p> \n\n<p>Wayne Madsen, FRIEND OF REP. CYNTHIA MCKINNEY: I don&#8217;t think so.</p> \n\n<p>I think what the congresswoman is asking is that, with the worst intelligence failure in the history of the United States, why cannot we have in this country a full independent congressional investigation of who knew what when. How was all this intelligence&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>COLMES: I agree there should be.</p> \n\n<p>MADSEN: Yes.</p> \n\n<p>COLMES: But she went further than that. She accused the Bush administration, if not Bush himself, of knowing in advance, because he or his father would benefit because of The Carlyle Group, which we&#8217;ll get to in a moment. She accused him of having advance knowledge of this. Do you concur?</p> \n\n<p>MADSEN: Well, you know who else is calling for an investigation in the financial</p> \n\n<p>(CROSSTALK)</p> \n\n<p>COLMES: But I&#8217;m not talking about an investigation. I&#8217;m talking about the accusation that the president &#8212; forget the investigation for the moment. I want to talk about an accusation that President Bush had advance knowledge. Do you agree with that?</p> \n\n<p>MADSEN: Judicial Watch is asking for the same investigation of</p> \n\n<p>(CROSSTALK)</p> \n\n<p>COLMES: I didn&#8217;t say investigation, sir.</p> \n\n<p>With all due respect, my question had to do with whether you concur that President Bush had advance knowledge of what happened on September 11. Do not use the word investigation, I beg of you, in your answer.</p> \n\n<p>MADSEN: I won&#8217;t use it. All I&#8217;ll say is, let the facts come out. And that&#8217;s all Congresswoman McKinney is asking for at this point in time.</p> \n\n<p>COLMES: Well, that&#8217;s not all she&#8217;s asking for. I would disagree that that&#8217;s all she&#8217;s saying.</p> \n\n<p>HANNITY: Well, Mr. Madsen, I&#8217;ll go to you here. And I expect a direct answer to a very simple question. What evidence do you have that our president was, in any way, had any knowledge of these attacks? Do you have any evidence at all?</p> \n\n<p>MADSEN: Sean, the evidence is out there. It was &#8212;</p> \n\n<p>HANNITY: Wait a minute.</p> \n\n<p>MADSEN: One place reported Salman Rushdie had been warned two weeks before September 11 not to fly. It was your paper, Mr. Murdoch&#8217;s paper, &#8220;The Times of London.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>HANNITY: What evidence, sir, do you have that links our president to that knowledge? Do you have any direct evidence, yes or no?</p> \n\n<p>MADSEN: There is ample evidence out there reported in the media about advance knowledge of what happened on September 11.</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Madsen, look, I don&#8217;t want you to tell me evidence is out there. This charge is against the president of the United States of America at a time we&#8217;re at war in a conflict. You&#8217;re making a charge that he has knowledge, prior knowledge of the September 11 attack. And I ask you, sir, specifically, what evidence do you have?</p> \n\n<p>MADSEN: There was a warning that the congresswoman referred to from President Putin before the attack. ..</p> \n\n<p>HANNITY: A warning to who?</p> \n\n<p>MADSEN: &#8230; warnings from French intelligence, Israeli, to the United States, FBI and to the CIA. And I find it strange that, here we suffered the worst intelligence failure in the country&#8217;s history and George Tenet is still director of the CIA. Can you imagine if they were airliners that crashed into buildings in downtown Tokyo?</p> \n\n<p>(CROSSTALK)</p> \n\n<p>HANNITY: That&#8217;s a different issue, Mr. Madsen.</p> \n\n<p>But, Mr. Madsen, an intelligence link or survey or something that came in does not represent &#8212; in any court of law, sir, does not represent&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>MADSEN: Why does&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>HANNITY: Hang on &#8212; enough evidence to convict &#8212; see, this is what&#8217;s going on here.</p> \n\n<p>Congressman, I&#8217;ll throw it to you. This is just an irresponsible, irrational political assault on the president while we&#8217;re at war. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s so offensive here to me.</p> \n\n<p>FOLEY: Well, in &#8220;The Washington Post&#8221; today, Cynthia says she has no evidence. However, if they would investigate, maybe some evidence would be turned up. So it&#8217;s like, what is she saying?</p> \n\n<p>(CROSSTALK)</p> \n\n<p>MADSEN: Why is the Bush administration against an investigation?</p> \n\n<p>(CROSSTALK)</p> \n\n<p>HANNITY: Mr. Madsen, you&#8217;re a journalist, sir. Would you even print this on this flimsy amount of evidence that you have here?</p> \n\n<p>MADSEN: I&#8217;ve read the work of many journalists: &#8220;The Times of London,&#8221; the BBC, &#8220;Der Spiegel&#8221; in Germany. They have all been reporting the same thing about advance knowledge. Is everybody crazy? Are all these journalists not allowed to express their opinion?</p> \n\n<p>COLMES: I agree with that. But the investigation aspect of it I think is something &#8212; maybe she has a point on that one.</p> \n\n<p>I know you want to respond, Wayne. Go ahead.</p> \n\n<p>MADSEN: Well, it&#8217;s typical. Attack the messenger.</p> \n\n<p>I mean, isn&#8217;t it funny? The Republicans, when Bill Clinton was president, they dragged him into every possible conspiracy theory, except for linking him to the Lindbergh baby kidnapping. I mean, now we see the same people saying Cynthia McKinney has no right to her opinion. She&#8217;s out there. I think it&#8217;s nonsense.</p> \n\n<p>FOLEY: Wayne, let me just say this. When they said that President Clinton launched the war simply to take away the Monica Lewinsky story, I absolutely refuted that and said that was absolutely wrong and unnecessary. I have not let false statements stand, whether they were Democratically directed or Republican directed. I think, in this particular instance, she has a fiduciary, as a member of Congress, to tell the facts and not lie.</p> \n\n<p>HANNITY: Absolutely. Good line.</p> \n\n<p>MADSEN: I think the Congress has a responsibility to investigate.</p> \n\n<p>HANNITY: Congressman Foley &#8212; we&#8217;re going to give you the last word.

The EPA now plans to examine vehicles for so-called defeat devices.</p> \n\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www3.epa.gov/otaq/cert/documents/cd-mfr-guid-ltr-2015-09-25.pdf\" type=\"external\">letter</a> released this morning, the EPA said federal regulations allow the agency to &#8220;test or require testing on any vehicle at a designated location, using driving cycles and conditions that may reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal operation and use, for the purposes of investigating a potential defeat device.&#8221; The EPA said it planned to begin conducting these additional procedures when vehicles undergo emissions and fuel economy testing, and it warned that the new procedures &#8220;may add time to the confirmatory test process and&#8230;additional mileage may be accumulated.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We are stepping up our testing,&#8221; Janet McCabe, the EPA&#8217;s acting assistant administrator, told reporters. &#8220;We take seriously our responsibility to oversee the enforcement of clean air regulations. The VW violations have made it clear that we need to adapt our oversight.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Last Friday, the EPA issued a citation to Volkswagen for equipping nearly 500,000 diesel-powered cars sold since 2009 with software that can detect when the car is undergoing federal testing for smog-forming emissions. During the test, the cars meet the standard; under normal driving conditions, emissions are up to 40 times higher. Similar devices were installed on some 11 million VW cars worldwide, producing illegal air pollution that <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">may contribute</a> to thousands of deaths. The resulting scandal <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">devastated VW&#8217;s share value</a> and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">forced the ouster of its CEO</a>.</p> \n\n<p>The EPA is currently investigating the full extent of the illegal software program and could ultimately deliver up to $18 billion in fines. Today&#8217;s announcement doesn&#8217;t affect that investigation. Officials said no recall has been announced and that if one is eventually called for, VW drivers will hear about it directly from the company.</p> \n\n<p>EPA chief Gina McCarthy <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/epa-to-overhaul-air-emissions-testing-in-wake-of-volkswagen-cheating-revelation-1443187913\" type=\"external\">said</a> the agency is concerned that other automakers could have similar devices that have gone undetected. Even if they don&#8217;t, VW is responsible for a new raft of regulatory headaches for all companies that want to sell cars in the United States.</p> \n\n<p>Chris Grundler, director of the EPA&#8217;s Office of Transportation, wouldn&#8217;t say exactly how his agency would sniff out defeat devices. But it would add additional time and rigor to the testing process, he said.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to tell them what the test is,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They don&#8217;t need to know.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "The Feds Have a Secret Plan to Stop the Next Car Pollution Scandal", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2015/09/volkswagen-just-made-life-harder-all-automakers/", "published_at": "2015-09-25", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Image source: Gilead Sciences, Inc.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>While following blindly in the footsteps of billionaires is risky, it's always interesting to see what stocks legendary investing gurus are selling, especially when it involves a widely held stock like Gilead Sciences . Last quarter, five billionaires tracked by The Motley Fool sold 6 million shares of Gilead Sciences. With billionaires heading for the exits in this big biotech, is it time for you to sell shares, too?</p> \n\n<p>Gilead Sciences' sales have rocketed higher over the past three years thanks to the launch of next-generation hepatitis C drugs that reduce treatment duration and deliver 90%-plus cure rates.</p> \n\n<p>However, now that Gilead Sciences' revenue has tripled since the launch of Sovaldi and Harvoni, growth may be tougher to come by than it has been previously, especially following the introduction of competing HCV therapies from Bristol-Myers Squibb, AbbVie Inc., and Merck &amp;amp; Co. All three of those companies are deep-pocketed and have shown a willingness to battle over price to win away market share in this big market.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Gilead Sciences, Inc.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Globally, more than 150 million people have hepatitis C, and in the United States alone, there are 3 million hepatitis C patients. Because of the size of this indication, revenue associated with hepatitis C treatments eclipses $20 billion annually.</p> \n\n<p>Gilead Sciences, however, already controls the lion's share of that market, and since new competitors are driving down prices, Gilead Sciences' growth in this indication relies on increasing prescription volume by more than prices are falling.</p> \n\n<p>So far, evidence suggests that script volume is climbing, but that the benefit of higher volume isn't offsetting the drag of lower prices. In Q1, Gilead Sciences' Harvoni revenue fell to $3 billion from $3.58 billion a year ago.</p> \n\n<p>Anticipating stalling sales growth led some of Wall Street's biggest money managers to move to the sidelines in the company's stock last quarter.</p> \n\n<p>The biggest billionaire seller of Gilead Sciences shares in Q1 was D.E. Shaw, the legendary manager of the quantitatively driven hedge fund that's named after him. In Q1, D.E. Shaw cut loose more than 3.9 million shares of Gilead Sciences.</p> \n\n<p>James Simon, whose investing chops have allowed him to amass a net worth of $14 billion, also put Gilead Sciences' shares on the chopping block. Last quarter, Simon's Renaissance Technology sold 1.6 million shares of the company.</p> \n\n<p>Billionaire Glenn Russell Dubin's Highbridge Capital Management also took shares in Gilead Sciences off the table in the first quarter, lightening his load by 672,600 shares.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Gilead Sciences, Inc.</p> \n\n<p>Although it's disappointing to Gilead Sciences bulls to see these top investors walk away, they might want to take a long-term view and stick it out with their shares.</p> \n\n<p>Gilead Sciences is rolling out a slate of new therapies addressing HIV, and those drugs are insulating the company's market share in that indication while also offering growth. Last quarter, Gilead Sciences' sales of its various HIV therapies improved by over 18% to $2.8 billion.</p> \n\n<p>The company's also expecting an FDA decision soon on its latest hepatitis C drug. If approved, this drug can shore up market share and possibly firm up pricing. The drug, which delivers cure rates in the high 90% range, would be the first pan-genotype HCV drug approved by the FDA.</p> \n\n<p>Additionally, GIlead Sciences' pipeline has intriguing therapies addressing potential blockbuster indications, including nonalcoholic steteohepatitis, a liver disease that's increasingly leading to liver transplants.</p> \n\n<p>If Gilead Sciences can maintain market share in its key indications and then expand into new markets, then the pause in revenue could be short-term. Given that the company's got a balance sheet boasting more than $21 billion in cash, and that it recently upped its dividend payout so that its shares now yield more than 2%, picking up shares for the long haul while they're on sale might be savvy.</p> \n\n<p>The article <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/05/25/billionaires-are-bailing-on-gilead-sciences-should.aspx\" type=\"external\">Billionaires Are Bailing on Gilead Sciences -- Should You, Too?</a> originally appeared on Fool.com.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/EBCapitalMarkets/info.aspx?source=eptfxblnk0000004\" type=\"external\">Todd Campbell</a> owns shares of Gilead Sciences.Todd owns E.B.

We use this term every day in discourse. It&#8217;s&amp;#160;popularly understood as meaning &#8220;keeping the things the way they are presently.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The term in itself has become meaningless, because it is incomplete. That term was originally part of a longer phrase based on &#8220;in statu&amp;#160;quo res erant ante bellum,&#8221;&amp;#160;which&amp;#160;translated means, &#8220;in the state in which things were before the war&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>In the context of the 14th century BC diplomatic Latin language from which&amp;#160;the term is derived, it&#8217;s referring to&amp;#160;an end to a &#8216;Marshal Law&#8217; scenario, or&amp;#160;the withdrawal of enemy troops and&amp;#160;the restoration of power to pre-war leadership.</p> \n\n<p>In case you haven&#8217;t noticed, America, and Europe, we are presently locked into a permanent state of war, or war state. The question is, against who? As the existential enemy becomes ever harder to sell to the public and risks fading into irrelevance, the state is developing an unhealthy&amp;#160;fixation &#8211;&amp;#160;on its own people.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Have the people always been the target? Societies and political cultures only have two directions to take &#8211; they either mature and thrive, or fester in a state of arrested, or retrograde development.&amp;#160;In America, you can count on any political party in power &#8211; be it a Democratic regime, or a Republican one,&amp;#160;to always insist that &#8220;things have never been better&#8221; in the country. That same lie gets passed on from one administration to another, like a Christmas fruit cake that no one is really eating.</p> \n\n<p>The same can be said between Labour and Conservative in Great Britain.&amp;#160;We&#8217;ve all heard that tired old line, over and over, &#8220;Our government has made this country better than it was 5 years ago&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>It seems to be built into the political machine code in our &#8216;mature democracies.&#8217; Why? Because no political advisor or head of communications wants to&amp;#160;stick their neck out in the event that a strategy of realism triggers a slump in the polls, so they opt for the politically correct option, or the easy way.</p> \n\n<p>Americans especially, do not like realism &#8211; and&amp;#160;mobs will almost always rail against it &#8211; even if what they&#8217;re hearing is true.&amp;#160;Just look at what happened to Texas Congressman Ron Paul, taunted and crucified by media, Democrats and Republican, and even by the Israel lobby (Sheldon Adelson&#8217;s gang&amp;#160;forked out&amp;#160;roughly $5 million to run negative ad campaigns against Paul during the 2012 primaries), all for being a realist.</p> \n\n<p>Establishment gatekeepers and culture makers&amp;#160;are now attempting to&amp;#160;make realism&amp;#160;ubiquitous with&amp;#160;their own derogatory term, &#8216;conspiracy theory&#8217;. It won&#8217;t be long before governments will want to demonize and persecute their own citizens for entertaining conspiracy theories and engaging in discussions outside of approved narratives.</p> \n\n<p>Our&amp;#160;downward constitutional trajectory&amp;#160;is comfortable&amp;#160;for&amp;#160;those clinging to administrative power, and ironically, it also suits the crowd too. For politicians, rejecting realism is simply an excuse to do nothing &#8211; so long as the cheques keep&amp;#160;rolling in. For the crowds, rejecting realism means they can avoid risk by not&amp;#160;initiating any action, boycott, strike, demonstration or applying pressure on politicians&amp;#160;to the&amp;#160;&#8216;ethical thing.&#8217; Neither group wants to stick their necks out, no matter what the long-term prognosis is. The net result is a fait accompli:&amp;#160;a gradual&amp;#160;degeneration of political life across the entire spectrum &#8211; politicians, voters and everyone in between.</p> \n\n<p>That&#8217;s exactly where America is at today &#8211; entering into a void of ethics, terminally ill with malignant growths in a government that&amp;#160;is medicating itself by passing an ever-increasing amount of new laws and regulations. The system is&amp;#160;completely addicted to them.</p> \n\n<p>They need a new one every day it seems, to patch up the one they passed yesterday, and the day before that.</p> \n\n<p>KAFKA AND WEBER: Drowning in a sea of administration.</p> \n\n<p>In this legally medicated society, the fundamentals of ethics have become obscured. History has taught us (some of us anyway) how in&amp;#160;a vacuous ethical&amp;#160;epoch, a significant amount power becomes concentrated in the administrative class; government agencies, administrators, &#8216;law enforcement,&#8217; third sector quangos, corporate charities, and&amp;#160;private government contractors. Collectively, they are&amp;#160;&#8220;the man in the middle.&#8221; The more oppressive public life becomes, the more the man in the middle&amp;#160;thrives. Even the political classes fear the man in the middle, who now form the largest voting bloc in the United States. The crowd fears the man in the middle because at any given moment in time, the administrative machine can ruin their life &#8211; with threats,&amp;#160;tickets, fines, detention,&amp;#160;restricted access, or social exclusion &#8211; the list is virtually endless.</p> \n\n<p>What the political and administrative classes struggle to understand is that when the ethical meltdown&amp;#160;goes&amp;#160;radioactive,&amp;#160;then things&amp;#160;begin to mutate, and at this point&amp;#160;anything is possible.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>As much as&amp;#160;in any other point in history, we&#8217;ve never been in more dire need for a in statu&amp;#160;quo res erant ante bellum.</p> \n\n<p>The German writer Franz Kafka once remarked, &#8220;Every revolution evaporates and leaves behind only the slime of a new bureaucracy.&#8221;&amp;#160;Maybe what&#8217;s needed is not so much a revolution, but a restoration.</p> \n\n<p>So a&amp;#160;restoration&#8230; of less government, less administration,&amp;#160;less laws, in a society underpinned by&amp;#160;common law,&amp;#160;and based on&amp;#160;common sense. Administrators and politicians won&#8217;t like it. It&#8217;s risky, sometimes messy&amp;#160;and it guarantees nothing, but compare this to&amp;#160;the present &#8216;in statu quo sins warranty&#8217; (state of affairs during the war) which is already halfway down a dark Kafkaesque tunnel.</p> \n\n<p>This article below illustrates everything that is wrong with western society today &#8211; where a New Jersey school child is steam-rolled by&amp;#160;a low-empathy-staffed,&amp;#160;politically correct&amp;#160;administrative machine.

This was not an inconsiderable factor is choosing to home school.</p> \n\n<p>Glen Meadow Middle School (in Vernon, N.J.) seventh grader Ethan Chaplin (photo, above)&amp;#160;told reporters that he was twirling a pencil with a pen cap on in math class when a student who harassed him earlier in the day shouted,&amp;#160;&#8220;He&#8217;s making gun motions! Send him to juvie!&#8221;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;As local school Superintendent Charles Maranzano explained, policy and law requires him to investigate any time a student is made&amp;#160; &#8220;uncomfortable&#8221; or threatened by another student. Thus it was that Ethan was summarily stripped, forced to give blood samples (which allegedly caused him to pass out) and urine samples, so he could be tested for drugs.&amp;#160; Four hours later a social worker cleared him to return to class, but a doctors decreed that a five-hour physical and psychological evaluation was necessary before the boy would be allowed back in school.</p> \n\n<p>Then they hooked up Ethan to electrodes, and measured his reactions to pictures of cheerleaders, guns and drugs, and when his vital signs showed a positive response to a photo, he was hit with a mild electric shock.</p> \n\n<p>OK, I&#8217;m just kidding about the last part.</p> \n\n<p>But the rest is outrageous enough. I suppose this is more post-Sandy Hook hysteria. I don&#8217;t care.</p> \n\n<p>The entire community is responsible for allowing schools like this to exist, administrators so challenged in basic concepts of common sense and justice to be hired, and their children to be educated in institutions so warped by fear and stupidity. A horde of lawyers should descend on Vernon and punish it severely, not only the school. Every single responsible parent should withhold their children from these insane abuse-factories until satisfactory reforms and&amp;#160; overhauls of staff can be assured. If this account is true, the institutionalized child abuse in Vernon should be as big a story as Chris Cristie&#8217;s bridge traffic scandal, or bigger.</p> \n\n<p>This is the United States of America, dammit, and our children must not be treated this way.</p> \n\n<p>READ MORE POLICE STATE NEWS AT: <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">21st Century Wire Police State Files</a></p> \n\n<p>&#8211;</p>", "title": "Kafka\u2019s Amerika: A Society At War With Itself", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://21stcenturywire.com/2014/04/09/kafkas-amerika-a-society-at-war-with-itself/", "published_at": "2014-04-09", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>The United States, as a superpower, is in competition with global and regional competitors for influence in the world.

They helped us develop a list of 10, and we took it from there. Here&#8217;s how we ranked them:</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cuny.edu\" type=\"external\">1. SUNY/CUNY</a>(New York) As police sprayed tear gas on 10,000 students protesting cuts outside New York&#8217;s City Hall, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani suggested they put away their placards and &#8220;find a job for the day.&#8221; Students from the State University of New York and the City University of New York pressured legislators to reduce their initial budget cuts. But that probably won&#8217;t silence students, who are still stuck with a $750-a-year tuition hike, the state&#8217;s largest ever.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.wisc.edu\" type=\"external\">2. University of Wisconsin</a> (Madison, Wis.) When grates began appearing around outdoor heating ducts last winter, students saw it for what it was: a cold-shoulder treatment to the homeless. Administrators said the homeless&#8211;who sleep next to the ducts for warmth&#8211;create a menacing environment. Students claimed the university just wanted to hide the homeless problem from potential students and parents. Two months later, after protests, the grates were removed.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ucla.edu\" type=\"external\">3. University of California, Los Angeles</a> Students unsuccessfully fought Prop. 187 (which cuts health care and education for illegal immigrants) with voter-registration drives (UC students registered about 15,000 people). When 187 passed, students pressured the university to listen to them&#8211;and ignore the law. The UCLA chancellor agreed, pending legal battles.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.msu.edu\" type=\"external\">4. Michigan State University</a> (East Lansing, Mich.) When Gov. John Engler said he would end the Indian tuition-waiver program, breaking a 60-year-old treaty that promised generations of Indians a free education in exchange for land, MSU students chanted &#8220;Promises Made, Promises Kept,&#8221; at rallies and organized a campaign. In response, legislators reauthorized the program, which supported 2,700 students statewide last year. (But Engler promises to cut the waiver in 1996.)</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hawaii.edu/uhinfo.html\" type=\"external\">5. University of Hawaii</a> Students systemwide fought successfully to save a course subject taught virtually nowhere else&#8211;the Hawaiian language. &#8220;We&#8217;re not asking for more money,&#8221; said language student and lecturer Laiana Wong. &#8220;We&#8217;re saying don&#8217;t take any away.&#8221; They didn&#8217;t.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cornell.edu\" type=\"external\">6. Cornell University</a> (Ithaca, N.Y.) After a professor posted fliers advertising &#8220;treatment programs&#8221; for homosexuals, activists staged a sit-in near his office. While they let the fliers hang, students organized public dialogues about free speech.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.rutgers.edu\" type=\"external\">7. Rutgers University</a>(New Jersey) Students demanded the ouster of President Francis L. Lawrence after he remarked that African-Americans lack the &#8220;genetic hereditary background&#8221; to score well on college entrance exams. Protests&#8211;including a takeover of a nationally televised Rutgers basketball game&#8211;drew national attention. While Rutgers&#8217; board backed the president (who made repeated public apologies), it also adopted a student-faculty task force&#8217;s plan to ease racial tensions.</p> \n\n<p>8. Antioch College (Yellow Springs, Ohio) Activists at this 600-student school picketed John Kasich, GOP chair of the House Budget Committee, for student-aid cuts. After an ugly protest at Kasich&#8217;s state office (police were heavy-handed with tear gas), professors provided class time on nonviolent protest.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.unc.edu/welcome/\" type=\"external\">9. University of North Carolina</a> (Chapel Hill, N.C.) Youngsters at five area Head Start schools get one-on-one lessons from UNC volunteers. Students at Chapel Hill (home to the national Student Coalition for Action in Literacy Education) also tutor homeless families, autistic children, and adults learning English as a second language.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.colorado.edu\" type=\"external\">10. University of Colorado</a> (Boulder, Colo.) After launching demands for a more ethnically diverse curriculum in dramatic fashion&#8211;a hunger strike&#8211;students gained a major in comparative ethnic studies for the first time, and a student-faculty task force wrote a plan to increase diversity among teaching staff.</p> \n\n<p>Honorable Mentions: At the University of Florida, students protested a Gainesville redevelopment plan that would have doubled rents. Bradford College students in Bradford, Mass., blocked administrators&#8217; attempts to keep transgender activist Leslie Feinberg from delivering a commencement address.

At a rally on the eve of Bush&#8217;s Iraq invasion, a fellow protestor handed me a leaflet touting the now infamous Howard Dean, hoping that the propaganda would entice me to support his forthcoming candidacy.</p> \n\n<p>Of course, I was intrigued. Few other Democrats were speaking out against the imminent war on Iraq. Luckily, I ended up not taking the bait. Nevertheless many other activists unabashedly latched onto the Dean campaign in hopes he would represent their interests in Washington. Luckily for Howard, they all had credit cards and Internet access. But as the story goes, Dean was embarrassingly sacked during the primaries and his followers were told to traverse the pro-war Kerry trail instead.</p> \n\n<p>Howard Dean isn&#8217;t dead yet, however, as he has safely landed himself a lofty position within the establishment as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Unfortunately Dean&#8217;s nomination means little to the peace movement as his antiwar convictions have vanished.</p> \n\n<p>The second anniversary of the Iraq war came and past, yet the most popular &#8220;antiwar&#8221; Democrat remains speechless. Dean has said nothing about Bush&#8217;s potential forays in Iran and Syria. He has not muttered a single word about ending the US occupation of Iraq. Should we be surprised?</p> \n\n<p>Nope. Howard Dean&#8217;s &#8220;antiwar&#8221; convictions haven&#8217;t vanished &#8212; they never existed to begin with.</p> \n\n<p>Looking back into the dirty Dean files, we find that the good doctor has had a long pro-war history. He praised the first Gulf War, NATO&#8217;s intervention in Bosnia, Bill Clinton&#8217;s bombing of the Sudan and Iraq. He even went so far as to write President Clinton a love letter praising his foreign policy in 1995 as the US waged a brutal air attack on Serbia, bringing death and destruction upon civilians and the infrastructure that provided their only life support.</p> \n\n<p>As Dean told to President Clinton: &#8220;I think your policy up to this date has been absolutely correct &#8230; Since it is clearly no longer possible to take action in conjunction with NATO and the United Nations, I have reluctantly concluded that we must take unilateral action.&#8221; According to most post-war accounts, US air bombardment left the Serbian military relatively unscathed, while ethnic cleansing and violence increased drastically.</p> \n\n<p>Nonetheless, Governor Dean supported Clinton&#8217;s deadly policy without a wince of shame.</p> \n\n<p>Candidate Dean was no different. Despite voicing his opposition to Bush&#8217;s war when he entered the race for the White House, he never wholeheartedly opposed overthrowing Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. In September 2002, Dean had announced that if Saddam failed to comply with the demands of the United Nations, the US reserved the right to &#8220;go into Iraq.&#8221; Dean claimed he would gladly endorse a multilateral effort to destroy Saddam&#8217;s regime. In fact, Dean wasn&#8217;t even opposed to a unilateral effort lacking the support of the UN, NATO, or the European Union (see Part Two forthcoming).</p> \n\n<p>On CBS&#8217;s Meet the Press in July 2003, Dean told Tim Russert that the United States must increase its pressure on Saudi Arabia and Iran. &#8220;We have to be very, very careful of Iran&#8221; because President Bush &#8220;is too beholden to the Saudis and the Iranians,&#8221; he explained. But later in the broadcast, he conceded, &#8220;I support the president&#8217;s War on Terrorism.&#8221; Dean even went so far as to tell Russert: &#8220;I believe that we need a very substantial increase in troops. They don&#8217;t all have to be American troops. My guess would be that we would need at least 30,000 and 40,000 additional troops.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In a New York primary debate two months later, Dean elaborated: &#8220;We need more troops. They&#8217;re going to be foreign troops [in Iraq], not more American troops, as they should have been in the first place. Ours need to come home.&#8221; Dean, it seems, would have had the disorder in Iraq go on at all costs, though he wasn&#8217;t quite sure whose soldiers should do the occupying.</p> \n\n<p>When Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich grilled Dean during that same debate about Bush&#8217;s $87 billion Iraq package, Dean claimed that he would support it since &#8220;we have no choice &#8230; we have to support our troops.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>So do we support our troops by bringing them home, or by financing the occupation? The self-proclaimed antiwar candidate never clarified.</p> \n\n<p>JOSHUA FRANK, a native of Montana, is the author of the forthcoming book, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Left Out!: How Liberals Helped Reelect George W.

Reform movements need to be selective, and need to be clear and focused. In some ways the current mainstream education reforms are just that: Standardized test scores are used as a measure of achievement; a teacher&#8217;s effectiveness is determined by improvement in those scores; funds are awarded by competition, and so on. Yet, though it is unreasonable to demand everything, it is legitimate to scrutinize what is left out &#8212; for something left out might be crucial to the success of what is left in &#8212; and it is legitimate to question whether the reforms themselves contain within them elements that could unintentionally subvert the very goals of reform.</p> \n\n<p>One of the problems with current reform is that there does not seem to be an elaborated philosophy of education or theory of learning underlying the current reform movement. There is an implied philosophy and it is a basic economic/human capital one: Education is necessary for individual economic advantage and for national economic stability. This focus is legitimate but incomplete, for it narrows the purpose of education in a democracy, which should also include intellectual, social, civic, and ethical development. The theory of learning embedded in an accountability system based on standardized testing is a simplified behaviorist one. Learning is pretty much the acquisition of discrete bits of information measured quantitatively by a standardized test. Teaching is likewise reduced to a knowledge delivery system based on the mastery of a set of teaching techniques.</p> \n\n<p>This characterization of the reformers&#8217; theories of learning and teaching might not be true to their beliefs, but it&#8217;s hard to know what they believe since learning and teaching are rarely discussed in more robust terms. What they advocate suggests the behaviorist theory sketched above &#8212; a theory long since discredited in fields ranging from anthropology to cognitive science.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Perhaps the greatest strength of the current reform movement is its focus on inequality, on the poor performance of low-income and minority students. This is definitely a point of agreement for people along the ideological spectrum. Because reformers want to keep focus with &#8220;no excuses&#8221; on the unacceptable performance of poor children, they insist on addressing outcomes (in the form of test scores) rather than on inequality of resources and social conditions. This is an understandable strategy, but its narrow focus has a potent liability. Poverty itself tends to be pushed out of the picture.</p> \n\n<p>Poverty is mentioned, but, in a variety of ways, is downplayed. So all the damage poverty does to communities and to households, to schools and to other local institutions is rarely addressed. Low achievement then, by default, has to be attributed to teachers and administrators, whose work seems pretty straightforward, given the aforementioned theory of learning that underlies reform. If kids aren&#8217;t learning, it&#8217;s because teachers lack the techniques or motivation to deliver information to them.</p> \n\n<p>Although the reformers rightly focus on low-performing children, there is not much treatment of sub-populations within the overall group of low-performers. There is little mention of special needs children, English Language Learners, immigrant students, migrant students, undocumented students. In some schools, these sub-populations form a significant percentage of the student body.</p> \n\n<p>Finally, current reformers display no knowledge of &#8212; or apparent interest in &#8212; the history of school reform, or, for that matter, the history of education in the United States. The result is an ahistorical hubris that, at the least, prevents one from learning from past mistakes.</p> \n\n<p>Without a rich conceptualization of teaching and learning, without an understanding of the origins and maintenance of inequality, without an appreciation of cultural and linguistic diversity, and without a knowledge of history, school reform limits itself to technology and management systems &#8212; necessary but hardly sufficient to achieve its grand aims, and certainly insufficient to address the educational inequality that is at the center of its efforts.</p> \n\n<p>* * *</p> \n\n<p>Current reform-oriented education policy makes improvement in standardized test scores in reading and mathematics the gold standard of educational success for students, their teachers, and their schools. To be sure, reading and math are core academic skills, but the tests measure them in one relatively restricted way. Furthermore, when one kind of test dominates and when the stakes are high, the tests can drive and compress the curriculum. What is tested gains in importance and other subjects fade. Math is hit hard; social studies, history, and even science are weakened; and art and debate are pushed to the margin &#8212; if they survive at all. Research is showing that especially in schools populated by poor children, there is a narrowing of curriculum, a trend toward prepackaged, scripted lessons, and a strong focus on test preparation. You can do all this, get a bump in test scores, yet not provide a very good education.</p> \n\n<p>Though we hear a lot about test scores and proficiency levels, we hear hardly anything about intellectual engagement, curiosity, creativity, or aesthetics &#8212; or about taking a chance, pursuing an idea, being reflective. There&#8217;s pitifully little about ethical deliberation or thinking things through with others. For that fact, we don&#8217;t hear much about public education as the core of a free society.</p> \n\n<p>In the midst of all the heat of school reform, it would be good to step back and remind ourselves what we are ultimately trying to achieve. What is the end goal of school reform? Most would probably agree that the goal is to create vital classrooms and schools, better than we have now in scope and equitable distribution.</p> \n\n<p>Here are the basic questions that should be our touchstone for reform. What is the purpose of education in a democracy? What kind of person do we want to emerge from American schools? What is the experience of education when it is done well?</p> \n\n<p>Let us bring these questions to life with a vignette from a first-grade classroom in inner-city Baltimore. This is drawn from a book one of us wrote called &#8220;Possible Lives.&#8221; There are 30 children in the class, all from modest to low-income households &#8212; the kind of children at the center of school reform.</p> \n\n<p>As we enter the classroom, teacher Stephanie Terry is reading to her students a book called &#8220;A House for Hermit Crab.&#8221; Hermit crabs inhabit empty mollusk shells, and, as they grow, they leave old shells to find bigger ones; in this story a cheery hermit crab is searching for a more spacious home. The class has a glass case with five hermit crabs, supplied by Stephanie. As Stephanie reads the book, she pauses and raises broader questions about where the creatures live, and this leads to an eager query from Kenneth about where in nature you&#8217;d find hermit crabs. &#8220;Well,&#8221; says Stephanie, &#8220;let&#8217;s see if we can figure that out.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>She gets up and brings the case with the hermit crabs to the center of the room, takes them out, and places them on the rug. Then she takes two plastic tubs from the cupboard above the sink and fills one with cold water from the tap. &#8220;Watch the hermit crabs closely,&#8221; she says, &#8220;while I go to the kitchen. Be ready to tell me what you see.&#8221; She runs down the hall to get warm water from the women who prepare the children&#8217;s lunches. Then she places both tubs side by side and asks five students, one by one, to put each of the crabs in the cold water. &#8220;What happens?&#8221; she asks. &#8220;They don&#8217;t move,&#8221; says Kenneth. &#8220;They stay inside,&#8221; adds Miko.</p> \n\n<p>Stephanie then asks five other students to transfer the crabs to the second tub. They do, and within seconds the crabs start to stir. Before long, the crabs are moving like crazy. &#8220;Okay,&#8221; says Stephanie. &#8220;What happens in the water?&#8221; An excited chorus: &#8220;They&#8217;re moving.&#8221; &#8220;They&#8217;re walking all over.&#8221; &#8220;They like it.&#8221; &#8220;They&#8217;re happy like the crab in the book.&#8221; &#8220;Well,&#8221; says Mrs. Terry, &#8220;What does this suggest about where they like to live?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>That night the students write about the experiment. Many are just learning to write, but Stephanie told them to write their observations as best as they could and she would help them develop what they write. The next day they take turns standing before the class and reading their reports.</p> \n\n<p>Miko goes first: &#8220;I saw the hermit crab walking when it was in the warm water, but when it was in the cold water it was not walking. It likes to live in warm water.&#8221; Then Romarise takes the floor, holding his paper way out in his right hand, his left hand in the pocket of his overalls: &#8220;(1) I observed two legs in the back of the shell. (2) I observed that some of the crabs changes its shell. (3) When the hermit crabs went into the cold water, they walked slow. (4) When the hermit crabs went into the warm water, they walked faster.&#8221; One by one, the rest of the students read their observations, halting at times as they try to figure out what they wrote, sometimes losing track and repeating themselves. But, in soft voice or loud, with a quiet sense of assurance or an unsteady eagerness, these young people read their reports on the behavior of hermit crabs.</p> \n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot to say about Stephanie Terry&#8217;s modest but richly-stocked classroom and the skillful way she interacts with the children in it. We want to focus on two things: what Terry demonstrates about the craft and art of teaching, and the experience of learning that she generates for her class.</p> \n\n<p>Everyone in the current reform environment acknowledges the importance of good teaching. But most characterizations of teaching miss the richness and complexity of the work. When you watch Terry, you see that she is knowledgeable and resourceful across multiple subject areas &#8212; and is skillful at integrating them. She is spontaneous, alert for the teachable moment, and is able to play out the fruits of that spontaneity, plan next steps incrementally as the activity unfolds. She apparently believes that her students can handle a sophisticated assignment, and she asks questions and gives directions to guide them. It also seems that her students feel comfortable in taking up the intellectual challenge.</p> \n\n<p>What is interesting is that none of the current high-profile reform ideas would explain or significantly enhance her expertise. It is not merit pay that inspires her inventiveness: it didn&#8217;t exist in her district. (Though she would be happy to have the extra money, given that some of her classroom was furnished from her own pocket.) And it is not a standardized test that motivates her. In fact, some of the intellectual display we witness would not be captured by the typical test. What motivates her is a complex mix of personal values and a drive for competence. These lead her to treat her students in certain ways and to continue to improve her skill. Several years before this event, she participated in a National Science Foundation workshop aimed at integrating science into the elementary school classroom.As we think about this teacher we begin to wonder what would happen if the considerable financial and human resources spent on the vast machinery of high-stakes testing were channeled instead into a robust, widely distributed program of professional development. We don&#8217;t mean the quick-hit, half-day events that so often pass for professional development, but serious, extended engagement of the kind offered by the National Science Foundation and the National Writing Project &#8212; the sort of program that helped Stephanie conjure her rich lesson with the hermit crabs.</p> \n\n<p>These programs typically take place in the summer (the National Writing Project runs for four weeks), though there are other options, including ones that extend through part of the school year. Teachers work with subject matter experts; read, write, and think together; learn new material, hear from others who have successfully integrated it into their classrooms, and try it out themselves. Electronic media would be hugely helpful here, creating a variety of ways for teachers to participate, bringing in people from remote areas, and further enabling everyone to regularly check in as they try new things. Such ongoing participation would be crucial in further building the intellectual community created during the program. All of this already exists, but could be expanded significantly if policy-makers had a different orientation to reform, one that embodied a richer understanding of teaching and the teaching profession.</p> \n\n<p>Although pragmatic lifestyle issues certainly come into play in choosing any profession, the majority of people who enter teaching do so for fairly altruistic reasons. They like working with kids. They like science, or literature, or history and want to spark that appreciation in others. They see inequality and want to make a difference in young people&#8217;s lives. The kind of professional development we&#8217;re describing would appeal to those motives, revitalize them, and further realize them as one&#8217;s career progresses. Enriched, widely available professional development would substitute a human development model for school reform rather than the current test-based technocratic one. And because such professional development would positively affect what teachers teach and how they teach it, there would be a more direct effect on student achievement.</p> \n\n<p>The bottom-line question is whether or not a particular reform will enable or restrict the kind of thing happening in Stephanie Terry&#8217;s room. The hermit crab episode is, of course, drawn from a few days in one classroom, but it represents some qualities that you&#8217;ll find in good schools, K-12, urban or rural, affluent or poor. We&#8217;ll list these qualities, and as you read them, ask yourself to what degree the reforms currently being proposed &#8212; from value-added assessment of teachers to the conversion of low-performing schools to charter schools &#8212; would advance or impede their realization.</p> \n\n<p>Good classrooms create a sense of safety. There is physical safety, which for some children in some environments is a real consideration. But there is also safety from insult and diminishment. And there is safety to take risks, to push beyond what you can comfortably do at present.</p> \n\n<p>Intimately related to safety is respect. The word means many things, operates on many levels: fair treatment, decency, an absence of intimidation, and, beyond the realm of individual civility, a respect for the language and culture of the people represented in the classroom. Respect also has an intellectual dimension. As one New York principal put it, &#8220;It&#8217;s not just about being polite &#8212; even the curriculum has to convey respect. [It] has to be challenging enough that it&#8217;s respectful.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Talking about safety and respect leads to a consideration of students&#8217; opportunities to partake in intellectual work, to think through, to make knowledge, to demonstrate ability. Even in classrooms that are run in a relatively traditional manner, students contribute to the flow of events, shape the direction of discussion, become authorities on their own experience and on the work they are doing. Think of Stephanie Terry&#8217;s students observing closely, recording what they see, forming hypotheses, and reporting publically on their thinking.</p> \n\n<p>The good classroom, then, is a place of expectation and responsibility. Teachers take students seriously as intellectual and social beings. Young people have to work hard, think things through, come to terms with one another &#8212; and there will be times when such effort takes a student to his or her limits. &#8220;They looked at us in disbelief,&#8221; said another New York principal, &#8220;when we told them they were intellectuals.&#8221; It is important to note that such assumptions are realized through a range of supports, guides, and structures: from the way teachers organize curriculum and invite and answer questions, to the means of assistance they and their aides provide (tutoring, conferences, written and oral feedback), to the various ways they encourage peer support and assistance, to the atmosphere they create in the room &#8212; which takes us back to considerations of safety and respect.</p> \n\n<p>The foregoing characteristics combine to create vital public space. In an important post-revolutionary essay on education, the eighteenth-century journalist Samuel Harrison Smith wrote that the free play of intelligence was central to a democracy, and that individual intellectual growth was intimately connected to broad-scale intellectual development, to the &#8220;general diffusion of knowledge&#8221; across the republic. As we consider what the reform initiatives might achieve, we should also ask the old, defining question: What is the purpose of education in a democracy? The formation of intellectually safe and respectful space, the distribution of authority and responsibility, the maintenance of high expectations and means to attain them &#8212; all this is fundamentally democratic and is preparation for civic life. Students are regarded as capable and participatory beings, rich in both individual and social potential. The realization of that vision of the student is what finally should drive school reform in the United States.</p> \n\n<p>Michael B. Katz is Walter H.

(That the governor has supported and engineered a working Republican majority in Albany was left unmentioned.)</p> \n\n<p>As a loyal Democrat, this display of blind partisanship, while plenty unappealing, was what was necessary and required from him. The same cannot be said for the other shoulder on the battering ram, the state&#8217;s major unions, who have not&amp;#160;(or at least not yet) officially merged operations with Democratic Party.</p> \n\n<p>However, it is probably by now best for them, and surely for us, to dispense with the fiction that there is any meaningful daylight between the two, or that any response other than &#8220;how high&#8221; will follow the demand of Democratic Party leadership to jump.</p> \n\n<p>Just as revealing as the endorsement itself were the circumstances which framed it. Mirroring the contempt towards the WFP demonstrated repeatedly by the governor&#8217;s policies in his first term was that emanating from the party leadership directed toward the party&#8217;s Howard Dean wing. The latter, in response to the shit sandwich offered up to them, had made their displeasure known by supporting the insurgent candidacy of Park Slope law professor Zephyr Teachout and by demanding real action from Cuomo on campaign finance reform in exchange for the endorsement.</p> \n\n<p>This provoked the wrath of party insiders who regarded he failure to wave the pom-poms for Governor 1% as tantamount to treason.&amp;#160;A concise expression were the remarks of Mike McGuire, the political&amp;#160;director for the Mason Tenders of New York City, who professed to be &#8220;ashamed [he] ever helped found the WFP.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;To call yourself the &#8216;working&amp;#160;families&#8217; party and then draw the line in the sand over campaign finance reform is an absolute disgrace,&#8220; McGuire announced on his Facebook page.</p> \n\n<p>Rejecting the activists&#8217; demand that the WFP&amp;#160;should receive some meaningful concession in exchange for their endorsement of Cuomo, McGuire shot back, &#8220;How about a line in the sand over raising the minimum wage? Or establishing a true living wage? Or fully&amp;#160;funding the public transportation system? Or bringing jobs and opportunity and economic development to&amp;#160;the pockets of New York City and vast swaths of upstate New York that so desperately need them? When&amp;#160;you can&#8217;t pay the rent or put food on the table, campaign finance reform is a rich person&#8217;s problem. The&amp;#160;WFP leadership is now nothing more than a bunch of Park Slope limousine liberals, either literally or&amp;#160;figuratively.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Leave aside the blatant dishonesty of the implication that Cuomo has any interest in pursuing &#8220;a true living wage&#8221; or other economic policies which help &#8220;put food on the table&#8221; or &#8220;provide jobs&#8221; for upstate residents, or that the real estate moguls backing Cuomo&#8217;s campaigns have the slightest concern with those who &#8220;can&#8217;t pay the rent.&#8221; What is most glaring here is the hypocrisy of a six-figure union boss smearing as &#8220;limousine liberals&#8221; the rank-and-file activist base of the party who likely have salaries far below the six figures typical of labor leaders like him.</p> \n\n<p>Unfortunately, McGuire will almost certainly get away with it, as the targets of his rant rarely if ever hit back. This despite their possession of&amp;#160;a huge club to wield if they chose to use it: the indictments Robert Fitch memorably assembled in his classic 2006 expos&#233; Solidarity for Sale.</p> \n\n<p>As Fitch documented, union leadership salaries are achieved through concessionary contracts negotiated with industry, their well-stuffed bank accounts often derived from funds directly or indirectly stolen from local treasuries for which they escape prosecution via &#8220;get out of jail free cards&#8221; provided by &#8220;labor Democrats.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Completing the circle, blank checks to the Democratic Party from near-bankrupt unions provide leadership with &#8220;seats at the table&#8221; where they collude in policies responsible for a decades-long collapse in union density now at single digits in the private sector. Doing so provides them with a reputation for &#8220;seriousness&#8221; and &#8220;pragmatism&#8221; making possible lateral moves into establishment think tanks and corporate boards.</p> \n\n<p>The WFP deal is just one more episode in this depressing charade. And if the history offered by Fitch is not enough, there is also Eric Chester&#8217;s brilliant 2004 historical monograph True Mission: Socialism and the Labor Party Question in the US,&amp;#160;which identifies a consistent pattern of labor unions undermining repeated attempts to form independent left parties going back more than a century,&amp;#160;raising hopes and then dashing them by folding the efforts back into the Democratic Party&amp;#160;&#8212;&amp;#160;then, as now, controlled by elite corporate interests.</p> \n\n<p>Readers of Chester&#8217;s book will discover why early socialists, including most notably Eugene Debs, vehemently opposed attempts by party moderates to form a Labor Party based in the existing unions of his day, whose leadership was as compromised and capitulationist then as New York state labor leaders showed themselves to be last weekend.</p> \n\n<p>The current generation of leftists have either forgotten or, more likely, never learned this history.&amp;#160;They have fetishized unions and union leadership taking for granted as the best hope&amp;#160;of third party organizing, in the formation of a Labor Party created at the initiative of existing unions. Chester shows how this hope is a chimera: to expect what Debs called &#8220;the bourgeois unions&#8221; to act in the broad interest of the working class by challenging the two corporate parties is as unrealistic as the expectation that the expropriators will expropriate themselves.</p> \n\n<p>By unmasking the New York union leadership as craven and unprincipled, the WFP convention debacle provided the Left what could be a teachable moment, forcing the general realization that unions are deeply rooted in the capitalist system and in the individualist ethos which supports it.</p> \n\n<p>The Left must begin to develop fully independent organizations outside of establishment channels which are able to seriously contend with capital and erode the foundations on which its legitimacy rests.&amp;#160;Anything less is a recipe for failure.</p>", "title": "Pulling the Plug on Working Families", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://jacobinmag.com/2014/06/pulling-the-plug-on-working-families/", "published_at": "2018-10-03", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Guardian: American troops in Baghdad yesterday blasted their way into the home of an Iraqi journalist working for the Guardian and Channel 4, firing bullets into the bedroom where he was sleeping with his wife and children.</p> \n\n<p>Ali Fadhil, who two months ago won the Foreign Press Association young journalist of the year award, was hooded and taken for questioning.

Zamora rightly points out that the &#8220;image of Foucault as being in total opposition to neoliberalism at the end of his life&#8221; is a strained reading of a thinker whose relationship to the crisis of the 1970s welfare state is at the very least more ambiguous than that.</p> \n\n<p>At the same time, Zamora&#8217;s argument demonstrates the limitations imposed by the displacement of &#8220;capitalism&#8221; by &#8220;neoliberalism&#8221; as a central category of left analysis. For his tacit premise seems to be that, if it can be shown that Foucault showed an &#8220;indulgence&#8221; toward neoliberalism, we must therefore put down his influence as a reactionary one.</p> \n\n<p>But what Foucault&#8217;s curious intersection with the project of the neoliberal right actually exemplifies, I would argue, is an ambiguity at the heart of the crisis of the 1970s that&amp;#160;gave rise to the neoliberal project. That he can be picked up by the Right as easily as the Left says much about the environment that produced him. Meanwhile, Zamora&#8217;s own reaction says something important about a distinction within the social democratic left that is worth spending some time on, which I&#8217;ll return to below.</p> \n\n<p>Zamora makes much of the neoliberal move away from the attempt to reduce inequality, in the direction of targeted efforts to alleviate poverty and provide a minimum standard of living. (In a juicy bit bound to delight those of us immersed in the wonky details of empirical measures of inequality, he even quotes one of Foucault&#8217;s right-wing contemporaries positing that &#8220;the distinction between absolute poverty and relative poverty is in fact the distinction between capitalism and socialism.&#8221;)</p> \n\n<p>But in doing so, he elides the force of the Foucauldian critique of the welfare state. It is true that the move away from universal social provision and toward targeted aid is a hallmark of social policy in the era of welfare state retrenchment. But this is not the main point of Foucault&#8217;s argument, even by Zamora&#8217;s own telling.</p> \n\n<p>Foucault, he argues, &#8220;was highly attracted to economic liberalism&#8221; because &#8220;he saw in it the possibility of a form of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governmentality\" type=\"external\">governmentality</a> that was much less normative and authoritarian than the socialist and communist left.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It is possible to see this as nothing more than either reaction or na&#239;vet&#233;, as Zamora seems to when he warns of Foucault&#8217;s mistake in putting &#8220;the mechanisms of social assistance and social insurance .&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;. on the same plane as the prison, the barracks, or the school.&#8221; But it&#8217;s possible to extract a different lesson about the nature of the system that Foucault was analyzing.</p> \n\n<p>At the heart of Zamora&#8217;s own project, he says, is a disagreement with <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffroy_de_Lagasnerie\" type=\"external\">Geoffroy de</a>Lagasnerie&#8217;s argument that Foucault represents &#8220;a desire to use neoliberalism to reinvent the left.&#8221; Rather, he argues &#8220;that he uses it as more than just a tool: he adopts the neoliberal view to critique the Left.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Here we have the crux of the problem. For Zamora, the key political opposition is between &#8220;neoliberalism&#8221; and &#8220;the Left.&#8221; But neoliberalism is only a historically specific phase of capitalist class strategy, one which itself developed in the context of the particular form of welfare capitalism and class compromise that arose in the mid-twentieth&amp;#160;century. So if &#8220;the Left&#8221; is conceived primarily as a project against neoliberalism, its aims will be limited to the restoration of the pre-neoliberal order, which Zamora defines as &#8220;social security and the institutions of the working class.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But the value of Foucault, and others like him, is in highlighting the limits of any such strategy. Postwar welfare capitalism was, to be sure, a substantive achievement of the working class and the socialist movement. And it represented an equilibrium &#8212; call it the Fordist compromise &#8212; in which workers shared in the benefits of rising productivity.</p> \n\n<p>But it was also an inherently contradictory and self-subverting order. This was true both from the perspective of capital and of labor.</p> \n\n<p>For the capitalist, long periods of full employment and strong labor movements meant a <a href=\"http://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2009/1109reuss.html\" type=\"external\">profit squeeze</a> and escalating <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">political instability</a> as workers lost their fear of unemployment and poverty. The Fordist compromise was no more satisfactory for workers, as the historian Jefferson Cowie documents in <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/06/opinion/06Cowie.html\" type=\"external\">his writing on the 1970s</a>. What was called the &#8220;blue collar blues&#8221; represented the desire of workers for more than just higher paychecks: for more free time, for control over the labor process, for <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">liberation from wage labor</a>.</p> \n\n<p>The welfare state institutions that arose in that context were marked by the same contradiction: they were at once sources of security and freedom, and instruments of social control. As <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatriz_Preciado\" type=\"external\">Beatriz Preciado</a> says, in a quote Zamora produces as evidence of the bad new libertarian left: &#8220;the welfare state is also the psychiatric hospital, the disability office, the prison, the patriarchal-colonial-heteronormative school.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>One aspect of the welfare state made it dangerous to the employing class, while another chafed on the employed (and unemployed). Welfare capitalism has always been characterized by this tension between universalistic benefits tied to a universal notion of social citizenship, and carefully targeted systems of qualification and incentive designed to prop up specific social relations, from the workplace to the street to the home. This is a key insight of the school of comparative <a href=\"http://www.peterfrase.com/2011/06/de-commodification-in-everyday-life/\" type=\"external\">welfare state study</a> that distinguishes the decommodifying from the stratifying elements of the welfare state.</p> \n\n<p>One way to think of this is as the permeation of the contradictions of bourgeois democracy into the economic sphere. Just as capitalist democracies exist in an uneasy tension between the principles of &#8220;one person one vote&#8221; and &#8220;one dollar one vote,&#8221; so does the system of economic regulation simultaneously work to support the power of the working class and to control it.</p> \n\n<p>In contrast, Zamora seems unwilling to countenance this two-sided quality to class compromises in capitalism. As he puts it, the choice is either &#8220;that social security is ultimately nothing more than a tool of social control by big capital&#8221; (a view held by unnamed persons on &#8220;the radical left&#8221;), or that the bourgeoisie &#8220;was totally hostile&#8221; to institutions that &#8220;were invented by the workers&#8217; movement itself.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Zamora appears to view social insurance as representing the creation of &#8220;social rights&#8221; that cushion workers from the vagaries of the market, while leaving the basic institutions of private property and wage labor in place. This is a non-Marxist form of social democracy with deep theoretical roots going back to <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/1397127/Three_pillars_of_welfare_state_theory\" type=\"external\">Karl Polanyi and T.&amp;#160;H. Marshall</a>, and it was arguably the main way in which the European social democratic parties saw themselves in their heyday.</p> \n\n<p>This kind of social democracy is the protagonist in Sheri Berman&#8217;s recent&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Primacy-Politics-Democracy-Twentieth/dp/0521521106\" type=\"external\">book</a> on the history of European social democracy, in which the Polanyian pragmatists are pitted against Marxists who, in her view, ignored the exigencies of social reform altogether in favor of an apocalyptic insistence that the capitalist system would inevitably collapse and usher in revolution. The endpoint of this kind of Polanyian socialism is a welfare state that protects the working class from the workings of an unfettered market.</p> \n\n<p>There is, however, another way to think about the welfare state from a Marxist perspective. It is possible to believe that fighting for a robust and universal welfare state is a necessary and desirable project, while at the same time believing that the socialist imagination cannot end there, because the task of humanizing capitalism generates its own contradictions.</p> \n\n<p>On this view, the system Foucault analyzed was a system that could not simply continue on in static equilibrium; it had to be either transcended in a socialist direction, or, as happened, dismantled in a project of capitalist retrenchment. From this perspective, the importance of figures like Foucault is not just as misleaders or budding reactionaries, but as indicators of social democracy&#8217;s limits, and of the inability of the mainstream left at the time to reckon with the crisis that its own victories had produced.</p> \n\n<p>By the same token, neoliberalism can be seen not just as a tool to smash the institutions of the working class, but also as a mystified and dishonest representation of the workers&#8217; own frustrated desires for freedom and autonomy.</p> \n\n<p>Zamora speaks of Foucault imagining &#8220;a neoliberalism that wouldn&#8217;t project its anthropological models on the individual, that would offer individuals greater autonomy vis-&#224;-vis the state.&#8221; Other than the name, this does not sound much at all like the really existing neoliberal turn, which has only <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">reconfigured</a> the densely connected relationship between state and market rather than freeing the latter from the former.</p> \n\n<p>This vision of autonomy sounds more like the radical move beyond welfare capitalism, toward Wilde&#8217;s vision of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Soul_of_Man_under_Socialism\" type=\"external\">socialist individualism</a>. (Provided, that is, that we accord autonomy from <a href=\"http://crookedtimber.org/2012/07/01/let-it-bleed-libertarianism-and-the-workplace/\" type=\"external\">bosses</a>&amp;#160;equal place with autonomy from the state.) Postmodernism as premature post-capitalism, as Moishe Postone once <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/144630116/Postone-History-and-Heteronomy-Critical-Essays\" type=\"external\">put it</a>.</p> \n\n<p>None of this is to say that the fight for universal social provision is unimportant; nor is it to dispute Zamora&#8217;s point that the fight for universal economic rights has tended, in recent times to be eclipsed by &#8220;a centering of the victim who is denied justice,&#8221; as he quotes Isabelle Garo.</p> \n\n<p>The point is only that it is worth thinking about what happens on the other side of such battles. Whether one finds it useful to think along these lines depends, ultimately, on what one sees as the horizon of left politics.</p> \n\n<p>Zamora speaks mournfully of the disappearance of exploitation and wealth inequality as touchstones of argument and organizing, and of the dismantling of systems of social insurance. Yet he himself seems unwilling to go beyond the creation and maintenance of humanized forms of exploitation, a perhaps more egalitarian (but not equal) distribution of wealth. He speaks favorably of Polanyi&#8217;s principle of &#8220;withdrawing the individual out of the laws of the market and thus reconfiguring relations of power between capital and labor&#8221;; meanwhile, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Gorz\" type=\"external\">Andr&#233; Gorz</a>&#8217;s elevation of the &#8220;right to be lazy&#8221; is dismissed and equated with Thatcherism.</p> \n\n<p>This Polanyian social democracy as a harmonious &#8220;reconfiguring&#8221; of the capital-labor relation is a far cry from the Marxist insistence on abolishing that relation altogether. But its inadequacy as either an inspiring utopia or a sustainable social order is the real lesson of the crisis that gave rise to neoliberalism. And while Foucault may not have come to all the right conclusions about addressing that crisis, he at least asked some of the right questions.</p>", "title": "Beyond the Welfare State", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://jacobinmag.com/2014/12/beyond-the-welfare-state/https%3A//www.jacobinmag.com/2014/12/beyond-the-welfare-state/", "published_at": "2018-10-03", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>On the eve of some of the busiest travel days of the year, airport&amp;#160;scanners are causing&amp;#160;hysteria&#8211;and with good reason. Never mind the puerile TSA screeners giggling at your naked body. It turns out that the things may pose&amp;#160;serious health concerns. In a <a href=\"http://holt.house.gov/images/stories/updated_TSA_letter_11.19.2010.pdf\" type=\"external\">letter to John Pistole</a>, administrator of TSA, New Jersey Congressman Rush Holt, a scientist and the Chairman of the House Select Intelligence Oversight Panel, raised the possibility that the machines&amp;#160;might be carcinogenic.</p> \n\n<p>In March, the Congressional Biomedical Caucus (of which I am a co-chair) hosted a presentation on this technology by TSA, as well as a briefing by Dr. David Brenner of Columbia University on the potential health effects of &#8220;back scatter&#8221; x-ray devices. As Dr. Brenner noted in his presentation and in subsequent media interviews, the devices currently in use and proposed for wider deployment this year currently deliver to the scalp &#8220;20 times the average dose that is typically quoted by TSA and throughout the industry.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Dr. Brenner has pointed out that the majority of the radiation from X-ray backscatter machines strikes the top of the head, which is where 85 percent of the 800,000 cases of basal cell carcinoma diagnosed in the United States each year develop. According to Dr. Brenner, excessive x-ray exposure can act as a cancer rate multiplier, which is why our government should investigate thoroughly the potential health risks associated with this technology.V</p> \n\n<p>Various experts have questioned whether&amp;#160;older people and children ought to be subjected to scanners, and whether people susceptible to or having melanoma and cataracts should undergo the scan.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Holt also questioned the efficacy of the body scanners, which would come as no surprise to critics who&#8217;ve been lambasting them for years. Last January, when the&amp;#160;government&#8217;s appetite for body scanners got a big boost from the underwear bomber, there was skepticism about their ability to detect&amp;#160;the types of explosives favored by would-be airline bombers. As <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">I wrote at the time</a>:</p> \n\n<p>Known by their opponents as &#8220;digital strip search&#8221; machines, the full-body scanners use one of two technologies&#8212;millimeter wave sensors or backscatter x-rays&#8212;to see through clothing, producing ghostly images of naked passengers. Yet critics say that these, too, are highly fallible, and are incapable of revealing explosives hidden in body cavities&#8212;an age-old method for smuggling contraband. If that&#8217;s the case, a terrorist could hide the entire bomb works within his or her body, and breeze through the virtual strip search undetected. Yesterday, the London Independent reported on &#8220;authoritative claims that officials at the [UK] Department for Transport and the Home Office have already tested the scanners and were not persuaded that they would work comprehensively against terrorist threats to aviation.&#8221; A British defense-research firm reportedly found the machines unreliable in detecting &#8220;low-density&#8221; materials like plastics, chemicals, and liquids&#8212;precisely what the underwear bomber had stuffed in his briefs.</p> \n\n<p>Just to be sure I am not going off the deep end on this subject, I emailed Steve Elson, the intrepid former Navy Seal who worked on the federal government&#8217;s Red Team, which was deployed&amp;#160; in the years before 9/11 to test airport security by infiltrating through check points. This they did with ease; but noone ever paid any attention to their reports. Since 9/11 Elson has worked on and off with television crews, continuing to penetrate airport security carrying with him all manner of guns and IEDs,&amp;#160;and for the most part avoiding detection. In a CBC program last year at this time, the Canadians reviewed the air security situation and found it to be wanting. The reporters also got hold of a <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2009-2010/fasten_your_seatbelts/images/CATSA-Report-ProTech-Integrated-Checkpoint-Trial-Kelowna-Airport.pdf\" type=\"external\">redacted report&amp;#160;</a>from the Canadian transport people which raised questions about the effectiveness of full body scanners, especially when they are used in combination with metal detectors: A person passing through one machine after another would have to place their arms in different positions and the Canadians found the body scanners would fail to detect objects like rings or bracelets on extended arms because the mechanism could not reach high enough to take them in.</p> \n\n<p>This morning&#8217;s Washington Post carried a list of people exempt from body scanning, including cops and military in uniform. I asked Elson about this, and he replied:</p> \n\n<p>When I was traveling through Chicago last January on my way to Toronto to do an interview, I had some time between planes. Got a sandwich. No place to sit down so I literally walked into the back of a checkpoint that was enclosed by glass so everyone could see what was going on, sat down on a bench and ate my sandwich, and&amp;#160; watched. Noone touched the pilots. Ergo, all I needed was a pilot&#8217;s uniform, bought or stolen, and a photoshop badge. Put explosives on my body, no metal, walk through, pick up my stuff and off to the plane. Likewise, I could do something similar on the ramp. Best time is in cold weather and snow storms. Do it as night approaches. People don&#8217;t care about security, just getting the job done and getting out of the weather. Steal a bag tag, make an unauthorized entry (no problem), walk up to a plane and throw it in with 50 lbs explosive.</p> \n\n<p>Elson has always contended that the body scanner&amp;#160;couldn&#8217;t detect explosives in body cavities. In his email he added this: &#8220;The machine can see through a thin layer of clothing and probably detect explosives strapped to the body.&#8221; But he pointed out that Leslie Stahl on &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=5205160n&amp;amp;tag=related;photovideo\" type=\"external\">60 Minutes</a>&#8221; worried about exposing private parts, but &amp;#160;noted she could see a woman&#8217;s bra. &#8220;If she could see the bra, that means she could not see through the bra. A bra bomb or explosives molded to the breast wouldn&#8217;t be seen,&#8221; he continues. &#8220;And a woman, because of her anatomical construction, could easily&#8230; bring a several pound IED fully assembled with timer, detonator, power sources right through the checkpoint. If scanned or patted down it would make no difference. Once on the plane she has the option to leave it in&amp;#160; the plane&#8230;and get off.&#8221;&amp;#160;Ellison warns that a well planned Al Qaeda operation,&amp;#160;&#8221;if they did it right, could knock down 50 planes in 30 minutes. Think about what that would do to US air operations.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In my opinion, the best answer to airport security is the mass deployment of dogs. Give me a friendly German Shepherd, and I&#8217;ll gladly submit to being sniffed, rather than patted, wanded, or scanned. But unlike the scanner companies, dogs have no powerful lobbyists, like former Homeland Security chief Michael Chertoff, to advocate on their behalf.</p> \n\n<p>Make room for Fido</p>", "title": "Invasion of the Body Scanners: Airport Security May Not Work, But It Does Cause Cancer", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2010/11/invasion-body-scanners-airport-security-may-not-work-it-does-cause-cancer/", "published_at": "2010-11-23", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Hamid Karzai is acting up.

Sanger and Ashley Parker, leading with the news that Mitt Romney had personally approved the blistering Tuesday night statement on the attacks in Libya and Egypt <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/mitt-romney-libya-egypt-media-reactions_n_1877266.html\" type=\"external\">that landed</a> his campaign in trouble.</p> \n\n<p>But hours later, the newspaper <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2012/09/alright_whats_up.php?m=1\" type=\"external\">wiped</a> the story out and replaced it with a significantly rewritten piece bylined by Peter Baker and Ashley Parker&#8230;.</p> \n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/us/politics/behind-romneys-decision-to-criticize-obama-on-libya.html\" type=\"external\">later version</a>, which appeared on the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/indexes/2012/09/13/todayspaper/index.html\" type=\"external\">front page</a> of Thursday&#8217;s paper, fleshed out the controversy with more details, but no longer included a couple key anonymous quotes from people close to the candidate, one who offered the rationale behind Romney&#8217;s decision&#8211;to call out the Obama administration for supposedly &#8220;sympathiz[ing] with those who waged the attacks&#8221;&#8211;and another who criticized it.</p> \n\n<p>HuffPost quotes an email it got from <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Peter Baker</a>, the co-author of the second version: &#8220;As we reported more through the day, we found Republicans criticizing Governor Romney on the record, so why use an anonymous one?&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;There are too many blind quotes in the media and we try not to use them when it&#8217;s not necessary.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But there are obviously not a lot of &#8220;adviser[s] to the campaign&#8221; going on record to criticize Romney&#8217;s statement. Ironically, the original piece&#8217;s allowing an insider to air views that would otherwise probably get them fired is one of the rare fully justified uses of anonymous sourcing in campaign journalism&#8211;which is generally used to protect insiders from embarrassment over how much they gush about their candidates (FAIR Blog, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">8/20/12</a>).</p> \n\n<p>And no one from the Times explains what happened to the quote from the other adviser, the one where they say, &#8220;We&#8217;ve had this consistent critique and narrative on Obama&#8217;s foreign policy, and we felt this was a situation that met our critique.&#8221; As Talking Points Memo&#8216;s Josh Marshall ( <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2012/09/alright_whats_up.php?ref=fpblg\" type=\"external\">9/12/12</a>), who seems to have been the first to call attention to the switched articles, paraphrased: &#8220;So basically, we saw this thing happen.

A quote that was attributed to an unnamed adviser became a quote from a named adviser, Lanhee Chen, in the final version&#8211;but with the juicier half of the quote deleted. Of course the Times didn&#8217;t start using his name without talking to him, so obviously some kind of negotiation went on.

Manning, according to his attorney, to a friend who has been allowed to visit him, and to activists who have been demonstrating outside Quantico for his release from this private hell, he has been subjected to sleep deprivation, has been barred from exercising in the slightest, and recently was improperly placed by the Quantico base commander on suicide watch&#8211;meaning his clothing was removed, and also his reading glasses&#8211;as punishment for &#8220;disobeying&#8221; orders of the guards. (After news of this order, and publicity about it, the commander rescinded it, and was citicized by the Pentagon for allegedly overstepping his authority, an indication that public pressure in this case can help.)</p> \n\n<p>The aim of all this abuse, which is now being investigated by a UN human rights investigator, has been blatantly to crush his spirit, in hopes of getting him to agree to implicate Julian Assange, founder of the WikiLeaks organization, in inducing him to leak the hundreds of thousands of pages of documents, and the visual tapes, of Iraq and Afghan war reports, helicopter murder, and US State Department cables, all of which have been undermining the US war effort and the US diplomatic agenda.</p> \n\n<p>They are failing, because apparently Manning, who reportedly had been troubled by evidence of US war crimes in Iraq that he knew about and had been unable to interest superiors in, is not caving in to the pressure, and is not playing the US government&#8217;s and military&#8217;s sick game.</p> \n\n<p>In a story aired <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41241414/ns/us_news-wikileaks_in_security/?ocid=twitter\" type=\"external\">yesterday</a>, NBC news Pentagon correspondent Jim Miklaszewski reports that the Pentagon acknowledges that its investigators &#8220;have been unable to make any direct connection between&#8221; Manning&#8217;s alleged leaking of the documents in question, and Assange.</p> \n\n<p>That sure puts a big crimp in plans by the White House and the so-called US Justice Department to try and bring up Assange on charges of espionage under the antiquated and thoroughly discredited Espionage Act of 1917&#8211;a law famously misused to prosecute, convict and jail Socialist Party leader and presidential candidate Eugene Debs for giving a speech trying to dissuade American men from responding to the government&#8217;s World War I recruitment campaign.</p> \n\n<p>Pvt. Manning, whatever his fate at the hands of his military overlords, will someday be hailed as one of America&#8217;s heroes. Confronted by the overwhelming might of the most powerful war machine the world has ever known, and by a government that long ago tossed out any semblance of conscience or morality, he has stood his ground, refusing to lie on the promise of leniency.</p> \n\n<p>What the Obama administration, and President Obama as direct boss of the AG&#8217;s office and as commander in chief of the military, has been doing in Manning&#8217;s case&#8211;holding him in solitary confinement in a Marine brig, subjecting him to conditions that the world and international and US law recognize as torture, denying him the right to a speedy trial or court-martial on a charge of allegedly leaking secret documents&#8211;all in the attempt to wring a false confession out of him, is exactly what was done for years in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin.</p> \n\n<p>We Americans of a certain age, myself included, were brought up on stories of the Stalin show-trials, where people would admit to the most ridiculous charges after months of torture and abuse.</p> \n\n<p>How pathetic that now our own government is playing the same sickening game.</p> \n\n<p>And how inspiring, that in Pvt. Manning these criminals have met their match.</p> \n\n<p>Without Manning being willing to claim that Assange lured him or paid him to betray his duty, the government can have no espionage case. Nor can it even try to accuse Assange of theft of government &#8220;property,&#8221; if said information was simply provided to his organization gratuitously, as he has long insisted was the case. (Assange says he didn&#8217;t even know Manning, and still has no idea whether Manning was even the source of the documents WikiLeaks has been releasing to the consternation of the US and other governments. He insists it came from another party altogether.)</p> \n\n<p>This is, of course, not only a story about the torture and heroic resistance of one low-ranking military person. It is also the story about a truly outrageous and anti-democratic effort by the US government to destroy a legitimate public information outlet&#8211;WikiLeaks&#8211;and personally destroy or &#8220;neutralize&#8221; its founder and leader, the Australian journalist Assange.</p> \n\n<p>It was widely reported last year that when Assange and Wikileaks first de-scrambled and released the horrifying video of footage from a US helicopter gunship depicting in graphic detail the slaughter of a group of unarmed Iraqis in Baghdad, including two employees of the news organization Reuters, that the Pentagon had sent its agents &#8220;hunting&#8221; for him. Later, after WikiLeaks had dumped thousands of pages of military action reports from the Iraq and Afghan Wars, and then began releasing secret State Department cables, the government began a campaign of pressuring banks and the Visa and Mastercard organizations not to process donations to WikiLeaks. The process has largely worked, shutting down most fundraising for WikiLeaks. (You can still donate to support Wikileaks thanks to two banks in Iceland and one in Germany that have not bowed to that pressure. For information go to: <a href=\"http://www.wikileaks.ch/support.html\" type=\"external\">www.wikileaks.ch/support.html</a>)</p> \n\n<p>The government also went after the companies, like Amazon, whose servers were putting WikiLeaks on the Internet, which would have shut the document-publishing site down completely, except that hundreds of sites around the world offered their services as mirror sites, plus a small political party in Switzerland offered their server. (You can go to Wikileaks&#8217; site and read the leaked documents first-hand at <a href=\"http://www.mirror.Wikileaks.info\" type=\"external\">www.mirror.Wikileaks.info</a>)</p> \n\n<p>It seems increasingly evident that the US is also behind the current legal travails of Assange, who is currently under house arrest at the home of a supporter in the United Kingdom, where he is fighting extradition to Sweden to face questioning on very suspicious claims of sexual misconduct involving two Swedish women, at least one of whom has links through her brother to US intelligence services, and whose joint attorney was involved in assistant the US with the CIA rendition of several Swedish residents, who were subsequently subjected to torture in Africa. As the British feminist organization Women Against Rape has declared, the charges against Assange, and the effort by Swedish authorities to use an Interpol Red Alert and a European warrant to incarcerate Assange are highly suspect. They state on their website, <a href=\"http://www.womenagainstrape.net\" type=\"external\">www.womenagainstrape.net</a> &#8220;Women who are fighting for justice for themselves or their children are astounded at the zeal with which Julian Assange has been pursued.

A woman who went from humble beginnings in Chicago, to become a leading corporate lawyer, Michelle Obama is no shrinking violet. But she needed to become emotionally bullet-proof to deal with what came next.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;As&#8230;the first African-American first lady, I was also the focus of another set of questions and speculations, conversations sometimes rooted in the fears and misperceptions of others,&#8221; the First Lady said during a near half-hour commencement address at traditionally black Tuskagee University on Saturday.</p> \n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t long before these misperceptions began asserting themselves in the corporate media. In 2008, the New Yorker&#8217;s first magazine cover featuring Michelle Obama satirized her as a radical terrorist. The racial overtones could not have been more explicit.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\" /></p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It was a cartoon drawing of me with a huge afro and a machine gun,&#8221; she recalls.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Now, yeah, it was satire, but if I&#8217;m really being honest, it knocked me back a bit. It made me wonder just how are people seeing me.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Over the half-hour address, Mrs Obama recounted the racist comments she and her husband have endured. The highlights included Fox News calling the First Lady her &#8220;husband&#8217;s crony of color&#8221; and &#8220;Obama&#8217;s baby mama&#8221; (as if Obama was some street corner player that had left Michelle with a couple of kids &#8211; and not in fact a successful and committed married couple holding the highest office in the land). She&amp;#160;and the future President were even assumed to be &#8220;the help&#8221; by fellow guests at formal events.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Back in those days, I had a lot of sleepless nights worrying about what people thought of me,&#8221; she recalls. &#8220;I had to ignore all of the noise and be true to myself &#8212; and the rest would work itself out,&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>At this point in the speech, the graduates broke out in cheers and applause.</p> \n\n<p>As the room quietened, Mrs. Obama came to her point. This speech isn&#8217;t about her, but about the bigger issue of racism in America. The racism that people of color face every day, and the anger that has people on the streets from Baltimore, to Ferguson, and beyond.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re rooted in decades of structural challenges that have made too many folks feel frustrated and invisible, and those feelings are playing out in communities like Baltimore and Ferguson and so many others across this country.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But while these circumstances present their own set of challenges, the First Lady urged those affected communities never to lose hope for a better tomorrow.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The road ahead isn&#8217;t going to be easy. It never is for folks like you and me. Because while we&#8217;ve come so far, the truth is that those age-old problems are stubborn.</p> \n\n<p>But those views are no excuse to throw up our hands and give up!&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Mrs. Obama calls on communities to rally, organize and build each other up &#8211; so they can look those who would misjudge them in the eye and know they are equal. They must channel their anger into work, studying and the kinds of actions that elevate not only individuals, but entire communities. In short, it is time to rise with the kind of productive fury which propels us inexorably to the highest positions in the land. And from there, make a fairer, most just world for us all.</p> \n\n<p>Watch the address below:</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Featured Image via <a href=\"http://www.tuskegee.edu/Articles/michelle_obama_to_grads_channel_the_magic_of_tuskegee_university.aspx\" type=\"external\">Tuskagee University</a></p>", "title": "Michelle Obama Gives The Blistering Speech On Racism That White America Needs To Hear (VIDEO)", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://addictinginfo.org/2015/05/11/michelle-obama-gives-the-blistering-speech-on-racism-that-white-america-needs-to-hear-video/", "published_at": "2015-05-11", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Forty years after his death, Martin Luther King, one of the great prophets of American democracy, has been reduced to little more than a lifeless statue. Yet his courageous call for peace and criticism of his government at a time of war must not be lost to history.</p> \n\n<p>Toward the end of his life, King turned his attention to poverty and the war in Vietnam. After giving the speech below, in which he called America &#8220;the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today,&#8221; King was dropped from Gallup&#8217;s annual list of the most admired Americans and was ridiculed by the New York Times, among too many others. Soon after, he was murdered.</p> \n\n<p>King said that America &#8220;can never be saved so long as it destroys the deepest hopes of men the world over.&#8221; Those words were echoed years later by The Rev. Jeremiah Wright, a man who served his nation in uniform, who devoted his life to the welfare of his community, but was dismissed as a kook and a racist and a hater of his country for challenging its moral impenetrability.</p> \n\n<p>America, apparently, does not take well to criticism. Thus it seems an appropriate time to let that King, not the statue, but the patriot, say his piece.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>By the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.Text from AmericanRhetoric.com</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I need not pause to say how very delighted I am to be here tonight, and how very delighted I am to see you expressing your concern about the issues that will be discussed tonight by turning out in such large numbers. I also want to say that I consider it a great honor to share this program with Dr. Bennett, Dr. Commager, and Rabbi Heschel, some of the distinguished leaders and personalities of our nation. And of course it&#8217;s always good to come back to Riverside Church. Over the last eight years, I have had the privilege of preaching here almost every year in that period, and it is always a rich and rewarding experience to come to this great church and this great pulpit. I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice. I join you in this meeting because I am in deepest agreement with the aims and work of the organization which has brought us together: Clergy and Laymen Concerned about Vietnam. The recent statements of your executive committee are the sentiments of my own heart, and I found myself in full accord when I read its opening lines: &#8220;A time comes when silence is betrayal.&#8221; And that time has come for us in relation to Vietnam.</p> \n\n<p>The truth of these words is beyond doubt, but the mission to which they call us is a most difficult one. Even when pressed by the demands of inner truth, men do not easily assume the task of opposing their government&#8217;s policy, especially in time of war. Nor does the human spirit move without great difficulty against all the apathy of conformist thought within one&#8217;s own bosom and in the surrounding world. Moreover, when the issues at hand seem as perplexed as they often do in the case of this dreadful conflict, we are always on the verge of being mesmerized by uncertainty; but we must move on.</p> \n\n<p>And some of us who have already begun to break the silence of the night have found that the calling to speak is often a vocation of agony, but we must speak. We must speak with all the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision, but we must speak. And we must rejoice as well, for surely this is the first time in our nation&#8217;s history that a significant number of its religious leaders have chosen to move beyond the prophesying of smooth patriotism to the high grounds of a firm dissent based upon the mandates of conscience and the reading of history. Perhaps a new spirit is rising among us. If it is, let us trace its movements and pray that our own inner being may be sensitive to its guidance, for we are deeply in need of a new way beyond the darkness that seems so close around us.</p> \n\n<p>Over the past two years, as I have moved to break the betrayal of my own silences and to speak from the burnings of my own heart, as I have called for radical departures from the destruction of Vietnam, many persons have questioned me about the wisdom of my path. At the heart of their concerns this query has often loomed large and loud: &#8220;Why are you speaking about the war, Dr. King?&#8221; &#8220;Why are you joining the voices of dissent?&#8221; &#8220;Peace and civil rights don&#8217;t mix,&#8221; they say. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you hurting the cause of your people,&#8221; they ask? And when I hear them, though I often understand the source of their concern, I am nevertheless greatly saddened, for such questions mean that the inquirers have not really known me, my commitment or my calling. Indeed, their questions suggest that they do not know the world in which they live.</p> \n\n<p>In the light of such tragic misunderstanding, I deem it of signal importance to try to state clearly, and I trust concisely, why I believe that the path from Dexter Avenue Baptist Church &#8212; the church in Montgomery, Alabama, where I began my pastorate &#8212; leads clearly to this sanctuary tonight.</p> \n\n<p>I come to this platform tonight to make a passionate plea to my beloved nation. This speech is not addressed to Hanoi or to the National Liberation Front. It is not addressed to China or to Russia. Nor is it an attempt to overlook the ambiguity of the total situation and the need for a collective solution to the tragedy of Vietnam. Neither is it an attempt to make North Vietnam or the National Liberation Front paragons of virtue, nor to overlook the role they must play in the successful resolution of the problem. While they both may have justifiable reasons to be suspicious of the good faith of the United States, life and history give eloquent testimony to the fact that conflicts are never resolved without trustful give and take on both sides.</p> \n\n<p>Tonight, however, I wish not to speak with Hanoi and the National Liberation Front, but rather to my fellowed [sic] Americans, who, with me, bear the greatest responsibility in ending a conflict that has exacted a heavy price on both continents.</p> \n\n<p>Since I am a preacher by trade, I suppose it is not surprising that I have seven major reasons for bringing Vietnam into the field of my moral vision. There is at the outset a very obvious and almost facile connection between the war in Vietnam and the struggle I, and others, have been waging in America. A few years ago there was a shining moment in that struggle. It seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the poor &#8212; both black and white &#8212; through the poverty program. There were experiments, hopes, new beginnings. Then came the buildup in Vietnam, and I watched this program broken and eviscerated, as if it were some idle political plaything of a society gone mad on war, and I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic destructive suction tube. So, I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such.Perhaps the more tragic recognition of reality took place when it became clear to me that the war was doing far more than devastating the hopes of the poor at home. It was sending their sons and their brothers and their husbands to fight and to die in extraordinarily high proportions relative to the rest of the population. We were taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them eight thousand miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they had not found in southwest Georgia and East Harlem. And so we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools. And so we watch them in brutal solidarity burning the huts of a poor village, but we realize that they would hardly live on the same block in Chicago. I could not be silent in the face of such cruel manipulation of the poor.</p> \n\n<p>My third reason moves to an even deeper level of awareness, for it grows out of my experience in the ghettoes of the North over the last three years &#8212; especially the last three summers. As I have walked among the desperate, rejected, and angry young men, I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems. I have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action. But they ask &#8212; and rightly so &#8212; what about Vietnam? They ask if our own nation wasn&#8217;t using massive doses of violence to solve its problems, to bring about the changes it wanted. Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today &#8212; my own government. For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent.</p> \n\n<p>For those who ask the question, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you a civil rights leader?&#8221; and thereby mean to exclude me from the movement for peace, I have this further answer. In 1957 when a group of us formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, we chose as our motto: &#8220;To save the soul of America.&#8221; We were convinced that we could not limit our vision to certain rights for black people, but instead affirmed the conviction that America would never be free or saved from itself until the descendants of its slaves were loosed completely from the shackles they still wear. In a way we were agreeing with Langston Hughes, that black bard of Harlem, who had written earlier:</p> \n\n<p>O, yes, I say it plain, America never was America to me, And yet I swear this oath &#8212; America will be!</p> \n\n<p>Now, it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any concern for the integrity and life of America today can ignore the present war. If America&#8217;s soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read: Vietnam. It can never be saved so long as it destroys the deepest hopes of men the world over. So it is that those of us who are yet determined that America will be are led down the path of protest and dissent, working for the health of our land.</p> \n\n<p>As if the weight of such a commitment to the life and health of America were not enough, another burden of responsibility was placed upon me in 1954 [sic]; and I cannot forget that the Nobel Prize for Peace was also a commission &#8212; a commission to work harder than I had ever worked before for &#8220;the brotherhood of man.&#8221; This is a calling that takes me beyond national allegiances, but even if it were not present I would yet have to live with the meaning of my commitment to the ministry of Jesus Christ. To me the relationship of this ministry to the making of peace is so obvious that I sometimes marvel at those who ask me why I&#8217;m speaking against the war. Could it be that they do not know that the good news was meant for all men &#8212; for Communist and capitalist, for their children and ours, for black and for white, for revolutionary and conservative? Have they forgotten that my ministry is in obedience to the One who loved his enemies so fully that he died for them? What then can I say to the Vietcong or to Castro or to Mao as a faithful minister of this One? Can I threaten them with death or must I not share with them my life?</p> \n\n<p>And finally, as I try to explain for you and for myself the road that leads from Montgomery to this place I would have offered all that was most valid if I simply said that I must be true to my conviction that I share with all men the calling to be a son of the living God. Beyond the calling of race or nation or creed is this vocation of sonship and brotherhood, and because I believe that the Father is deeply concerned especially for his suffering and helpless and outcast children, I come tonight to speak for them.</p> \n\n<p>This I believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who deem ourselves bound by allegiances and loyalties which are broader and deeper than nationalism and which go beyond our nation&#8217;s self-defined goals and positions. We are called to speak for the weak, for the voiceless, for the victims of our nation and for those it calls &#8220;enemy,&#8221; for no document from human hands can make these humans any less our brothers.</p> \n\n<p>And as I ponder the madness of Vietnam and search within myself for ways to understand and respond in compassion, my mind goes constantly to the people of that peninsula. I speak now not of the soldiers of each side, not of the ideologies of the Liberation Front, not of the junta in Saigon, but simply of the people who have been living under the curse of war for almost three continuous decades now. I think of them, too, because it is clear to me that there will be no meaningful solution there until some attempt is made to know them and hear their broken cries.</p> \n\n<p>They must see Americans as strange liberators. The Vietnamese people proclaimed their own independence in 1954 &#8212; in 1945 rather &#8212; after a combined French and Japanese occupation and before the communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. Even though they quoted the American Declaration of Independence in their own document of freedom, we refused to recognize them. Instead, we decided to support France in its reconquest of her former colony. Our government felt then that the Vietnamese people were not ready for independence, and we again fell victim to the deadly Western arrogance that has poisoned the international atmosphere for so long. With that tragic decision we rejected a revolutionary government seeking self-determination and a government that had been established not by China &#8212; for whom the Vietnamese have no great love &#8212; but by clearly indigenous forces that included some communists. For the peasants this new government meant real land reform, one of the most important needs in their lives.For nine years following 1945 we denied the people of Vietnam the right of independence. For nine years we vigorously supported the French in their abortive effort to recolonize Vietnam. Before the end of the war we were meeting eighty percent of the French war costs. Even before the French were defeated at Dien Bien Phu, they began to despair of their reckless action, but we did not. We encouraged them with our huge financial and military supplies to continue the war even after they had lost the will. Soon we would be paying almost the full costs of this tragic attempt at recolonization.</p> \n\n<p>After the French were defeated, it looked as if independence and land reform would come again through the Geneva Agreement. But instead there came the United States, determined that Ho should not unify the temporarily divided nation, and the peasants watched again as we supported one of the most vicious modern dictators, our chosen man, Premier Diem. The peasants watched and cringed as Diem ruthlessly rooted out all opposition, supported their extortionist landlords, and refused even to discuss reunification with the North. The peasants watched as all this was presided over by United States&#8217; influence and then by increasing numbers of United States troops who came to help quell the insurgency that Diem&#8217;s methods had aroused. When Diem was overthrown they may have been happy, but the long line of military dictators seemed to offer no real change, especially in terms of their need for land and peace.</p> \n\n<p>The only change came from America, as we increased our troop commitments in support of governments which were singularly corrupt, inept, and without popular support. All the while the people read our leaflets and received the regular promises of peace and democracy and land reform. Now they languish under our bombs and consider us, not their fellow Vietnamese, the real enemy. They move sadly and apathetically as we herd them off the land of their fathers into concentration camps where minimal social needs are rarely met. They know they must move on or be destroyed by our bombs.</p> \n\n<p>So they go, primarily women and children and the aged. They watch as we poison their water, as we kill a million acres of their crops. They must weep as the bulldozers roar through their areas preparing to destroy the precious trees. They wander into the hospitals with at least twenty casualties from American firepower for one Vietcong-inflicted injury. So far we may have killed a million of them, mostly children. They wander into the towns and see thousands of the children, homeless, without clothes, running in packs on the streets like animals. They see the children degraded by our soldiers as they beg for food. They see the children selling their sisters to our soldiers, soliciting for their mothers.</p> \n\n<p>What do the peasants think as we ally ourselves with the landlords and as we refuse to put any action into our many words concerning land reform? What do they think as we test out our latest weapons on them, just as the Germans tested out new medicine and new tortures in the concentration camps of Europe? Where are the roots of the independent Vietnam we claim to be building? Is it among these voiceless ones?</p> \n\n<p>We have destroyed their two most cherished institutions: the family and the village. We have destroyed their land and their crops. We have cooperated in the crushing of the nation&#8217;s only noncommunist revolutionary political force, the unified Buddhist Church. We have supported the enemies of the peasants of Saigon. We have corrupted their women and children and killed their men.</p> \n\n<p>Now there is little left to build on, save bitterness. Soon the only solid physical foundations remaining will be found at our military bases and in the concrete of the concentration camps we call &#8220;fortified hamlets.&#8221; The peasants may well wonder if we plan to build our new Vietnam on such grounds as these. Could we blame them for such thoughts? We must speak for them and raise the questions they cannot raise. These, too, are our brothers.</p> \n\n<p>Perhaps a more difficult but no less necessary task is to speak for those who have been designated as our enemies. What of the National Liberation Front, that strangely anonymous group we call &#8220;VC&#8221; or &#8220;communists&#8221;? What must they think of the United States of America when they realize that we permitted the repression and cruelty of Diem, which helped to bring them into being as a resistance group in the South? What do they think of our condoning the violence which led to their own taking up of arms? How can they believe in our integrity when now we speak of &#8220;aggression from the North&#8221; as if there were nothing more essential to the war? How can they trust us when now we charge them with violence after the murderous reign of Diem and charge them with violence while we pour every new weapon of death into their land? Surely we must understand their feelings, even if we do not condone their actions. Surely we must see that the men we supported pressed them to their violence. Surely we must see that our own computerized plans of destruction simply dwarf their greatest acts.</p> \n\n<p>How do they judge us when our officials know that their membership is less than twenty-five percent communist, and yet insist on giving them the blanket name? What must they be thinking when they know that we are aware of their control of major sections of Vietnam, and yet we appear ready to allow national elections in which this highly organized political parallel government will not have a part? They ask how we can speak of free elections when the Saigon press is censored and controlled by the military junta. And they are surely right to wonder what kind of new government we plan to help form without them, the only party in real touch with the peasants. They question our political goals and they deny the reality of a peace settlement from which they will be excluded. Their questions are frighteningly relevant. Is our nation planning to build on political myth again, and then shore it up upon the power of new violence?</p> \n\n<p>Here is the true meaning and value of compassion and nonviolence, when it helps us to see the enemy&#8217;s point of view, to hear his questions, to know his assessment of ourselves. For from his view we may indeed see the basic weaknesses of our own condition, and if we are mature, we may learn and grow and profit from the wisdom of the brothers who are called the opposition.</p> \n\n<p>So, too, with Hanoi. In the North, where our bombs now pummel the land, and our mines endanger the waterways, we are met by a deep but understandable mistrust. To speak for them is to explain this lack of confidence in Western words, and especially their distrust of American intentions now. In Hanoi are the men who led the nation to independence against the Japanese and the French, the men who sought membership in the French Commonwealth and were betrayed by the weakness of Paris and the willfulness of the colonial armies. It was they who led a second struggle against French domination at tremendous costs, and then were persuaded to give up the land they controlled between the thirteenth and seventeenth parallel as a temporary measure at Geneva. After 1954 they watched us conspire with Diem to prevent elections which could have surely brought Ho Chi Minh to power over a united Vietnam, and they realized they had been betrayed again. When we ask why they do not leap to negotiate, these things must be remembered.</p> \n\n<p>Also, it must be clear that the leaders of Hanoi considered the presence of American troops in support of the Diem regime to have been the initial military breach of the Geneva Agreement concerning foreign troops. They remind us that they did not begin to send troops in large numbers and even supplies into the South until American forces had moved into the tens of thousands.</p> \n\n<p>Hanoi remembers how our leaders refused to tell us the truth about the earlier North Vietnamese overtures for peace, how the president claimed that none existed when they had clearly been made. Ho Chi Minh has watched as America has spoken of peace and built up its forces, and now he has surely heard the increasing international rumors of American plans for an invasion of the North. He knows the bombing and shelling and mining we are doing are part of traditional pre-invasion strategy. Perhaps only his sense of humor and of irony can save him when he hears the most powerful nation of the world speaking of aggression as it drops thousands of bombs on a poor, weak nation more than eight hundred, or rather, eight thousand miles away from its shores.</p> \n\n<p>At this point I should make it clear that while I have tried in these last few minutes to give a voice to the voiceless in Vietnam and to understand the arguments of those who are called &#8220;enemy,&#8221; I am as deeply concerned about our own troops there as anything else. For it occurs to me that what we are submitting them to in Vietnam is not simply the brutalizing process that goes on in any war where armies face each other and seek to destroy. We are adding cynicism to the process of death, for they must know after a short period there that none of the things we claim to be fighting for are really involved. Before long they must know that their government has sent them into a struggle among Vietnamese, and the more sophisticated surely realize that we are on the side of the wealthy, and the secure, while we create a hell for the poor.</p> \n\n<p>Somehow this madness must cease. We must stop now. I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam. I speak for those whose land is being laid waste, whose homes are being destroyed, whose culture is being subverted. I speak for the poor of America who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home, and death and corruption in Vietnam. I speak as a citizen of the world, for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken. I speak as one who loves America, to the leaders of our own nation: The great initiative in this war is ours; the initiative to stop it must be ours.This is the message of the great Buddhist leaders of Vietnam. Recently one of them wrote these words, and I quote:</p> \n\n<p>Each day the war goes on the hatred increases in the heart of the Vietnamese and in the hearts of those of humanitarian instinct. The Americans are forcing even their friends into becoming their enemies. It is curious that the Americans, who calculate so carefully on the possibilities of military victory, do not realize that in the process they are incurring deep psychological and political defeat. The image of America will never again be the image of revolution, freedom, and democracy, but the image of violence and militarism (unquote).</p> \n\n<p>If we continue, there will be no doubt in my mind and in the mind of the world that we have no honorable intentions in Vietnam. If we do not stop our war against the people of Vietnam immediately, the world will be left with no other alternative than to see this as some horrible, clumsy, and deadly game we have decided to play. The world now demands a maturity of America that we may not be able to achieve. It demands that we admit that we have been wrong from the beginning of our adventure in Vietnam, that we have been detrimental to the life of the Vietnamese people. The situation is one in which we must be ready to turn sharply from our present ways. In order to atone for our sins and errors in Vietnam, we should take the initiative in bringing a halt to this tragic war.</p> \n\n<p>I would like to suggest five concrete things that our government should do immediately to begin the long and difficult process of extricating ourselves from this nightmarish conflict:</p> \n\n<p>Number one: End all bombing in North and South Vietnam.</p> \n\n<p>Number two: Declare a unilateral cease-fire in the hope that such action will create the atmosphere for negotiation.</p> \n\n<p>Three: Take immediate steps to prevent other battlegrounds in Southeast Asia by curtailing our military buildup in Thailand and our interference in Laos.</p> \n\n<p>Four: Realistically accept the fact that the National Liberation Front has substantial support in South Vietnam and must thereby play a role in any meaningful negotiations and any future Vietnam government.</p> \n\n<p>Five: Set a date that we will remove all foreign troops from Vietnam in accordance with the 1954 Geneva Agreement.</p> \n\n<p>Part of our ongoing&#8230;part of our ongoing commitment might well express itself in an offer to grant asylum to any Vietnamese who fears for his life under a new regime which included the Liberation Front. Then we must make what reparations we can for the damage we have done. We must provide the medical aid that is badly needed, making it available in this country, if necessary. Meanwhile&#8230; meanwhile, we in the churches and synagogues have a continuing task while we urge our government to disengage itself from a disgraceful commitment. We must continue to raise our voices and our lives if our nation persists in its perverse ways in Vietnam. We must be prepared to match actions with words by seeking out every creative method of protest possible.</p> \n\n<p>As we counsel young men concerning military service, we must clarify for them our nation&#8217;s role in Vietnam and challenge them with the alternative of conscientious objection. I am pleased to say that this is a path now chosen by more than seventy students at my own alma mater, Morehouse College, and I recommend it to all who find the American course in Vietnam a dishonorable and unjust one. Moreover, I would encourage all ministers of draft age to give up their ministerial exemptions and seek status as conscientious objectors. These are the times for real choices and not false ones. We are at the moment when our lives must be placed on the line if our nation is to survive its own folly. Every man of humane convictions must decide on the protest that best suits his convictions, but we must all protest.</p> \n\n<p>Now there is something seductively tempting about stopping there and sending us all off on what in some circles has become a popular crusade against the war in Vietnam. I say we must enter that struggle, but I wish to go on now to say something even more disturbing.</p> \n\n<p>The war in Vietnam is but a symptom of a far deeper malady within the American spirit, and if we ignore this sobering reality&#8230;and if we ignore this sobering reality, we will find ourselves organizing &#8220;clergy and laymen concerned&#8221; committees for the next generation. They will be concerned about Guatemala and Peru. They will be concerned about Thailand and Cambodia. They will be concerned about Mozambique and South Africa. We will be marching for these and a dozen other names and attending rallies without end, unless there is a significant and profound change in American life and policy.</p> \n\n<p>And so, such thoughts take us beyond Vietnam, but not beyond our calling as sons of the living God.</p> \n\n<p>In 1957, a sensitive American official overseas said that it seemed to him that our nation was on the wrong side of a world revolution. During the past ten years, we have seen emerge a pattern of suppression which has now justified the presence of U.S. military advisors in Venezuela. This need to maintain social stability for our investments accounts for the counterrevolutionary action of American forces in Guatemala. It tells why American helicopters are being used against guerrillas in Cambodia and why American napalm and Green Beret forces have already been active against rebels in Peru.</p> \n\n<p>It is with such activity in mind that the words of the late John F. Kennedy come back to haunt us. Five years ago he said, &#8220;Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.&#8221; Increasingly, by choice or by accident, this is the role our nation has taken, the role of those who make peaceful revolution impossible by refusing to give up the privileges and the pleasures that come from the immense profits of overseas investments. I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values. We must rapidly begin&#8230;we must rapidly begin the shift from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society. When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights, are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered.</p> \n\n<p>A true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the fairness and justice of many of our past and present policies. On the one hand, we are called to play the Good Samaritan on life&#8217;s roadside, but that will be only an initial act. One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho Road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on life&#8217;s highway. True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar. It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.</p> \n\n<p>A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth. With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa, and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say, &#8220;This is not just.&#8221; It will look at our alliance with the landed gentry of South America and say, &#8220;This is not just.&#8221; The Western arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not just.A true revolution of values will lay hand on the world order and say of war, &#8220;This way of settling differences is not just.&#8221; This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation&#8217;s homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love. A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.</p> \n\n<p>America, the richest and most powerful nation in the world, can well lead the way in this revolution of values. There is nothing except a tragic death wish to prevent us from reordering our priorities so that the pursuit of peace will take precedence over the pursuit of war. There is nothing to keep us from molding a recalcitrant status quo with bruised hands until we have fashioned it into a brotherhood.</p> \n\n<p>This kind of positive revolution of values is our best defense against communism. War is not the answer. Communism will never be defeated by the use of atomic bombs or nuclear weapons. Let us not join those who shout war and, through their misguided passions, urge the United States to relinquish its participation in the United Nations. These are days which demand wise restraint and calm reasonableness. We must not engage in a negative anticommunism, but rather in a positive thrust for democracy, realizing that our greatest defense against communism is to take offensive action in behalf of justice. We must with positive action seek to remove those conditions of poverty, insecurity, and injustice, which are the fertile soil in which the seed of communism grows and develops.</p> \n\n<p>These are revolutionary times. All over the globe men are revolting against old systems of exploitation and oppression, and out of the wounds of a frail world, new systems of justice and equality are being born. The shirtless and barefoot people of the land are rising up as never before. The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light. We in the West must support these revolutions.</p> \n\n<p>It is a sad fact that because of comfort, complacency, a morbid fear of communism, and our proneness to adjust to injustice, the Western nations that initiated so much of the revolutionary spirit of the modern world have now become the arch antirevolutionaries. This has driven many to feel that only Marxism has a revolutionary spirit. Therefore, communism is a judgment against our failure to make democracy real and follow through on the revolutions that we initiated. Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism, and militarism. With this powerful commitment we shall boldly challenge the status quo and unjust mores, and thereby speed the day when &#8220;every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>A genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional. Every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual societies.</p> \n\n<p>This call for a worldwide fellowship that lifts neighborly concern beyond one&#8217;s tribe, race, class, and nation is in reality a call for an all-embracing and unconditional love for all mankind. This oft misunderstood, this oft misinterpreted concept, so readily dismissed by the Nietzsches of the world as a weak and cowardly force, has now become an absolute necessity for the survival of man. When I speak of love I am not speaking of some sentimental and weak response. I am not speaking of that force which is just emotional bosh. I am speaking of that force which all of the great religions have seen as the supreme unifying principle of life. Love is somehow the key that unlocks the door which leads to ultimate reality. This Hindu-Muslim-Christian-Jewish-Buddhist belief about ultimate reality is beautifully summed up in the first epistle of Saint John: &#8220;Let us love one another, for love is God. And every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth God. He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love.&#8221; &#8220;If we love one another, God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us.&#8221; Let us hope that this spirit will become the order of the day.</p> \n\n<p>We can no longer afford to worship the god of hate or bow before the altar of retaliation. The oceans of history are made turbulent by the ever-rising tides of hate. And history is cluttered with the wreckage of nations and individuals that pursued this self-defeating path of hate. As Arnold Toynbee says: &#8220;Love is the ultimate force that makes for the saving choice of life and good against the damning choice of death and evil. Therefore the first hope in our inventory must be the hope that love is going to have the last word&#8221; (unquote).</p> \n\n<p>We are now faced with the fact, my friends, that tomorrow is today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency of now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and history, there is such a thing as being too late. Procrastination is still the thief of time. Life often leaves us standing bare, naked, and dejected with a lost opportunity. The tide in the affairs of men does not remain at flood &#8212; it ebbs. We may cry out desperately for time to pause in her passage, but time is adamant to every plea and rushes on. Over the bleached bones and jumbled residues of numerous civilizations are written the pathetic words, &#8220;Too late.&#8221; There is an invisible book of life that faithfully records our vigilance or our neglect. Omar Khayyam is right: &#8220;The moving finger writes, and having writ moves on.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>We still have a choice today: nonviolent coexistence or violent coannihilation. We must move past indecision to action. We must find new ways to speak for peace in Vietnam and justice throughout the developing world, a world that borders on our doors. If we do not act, we shall surely be dragged down the long, dark, and shameful corridors of time reserved for those who possess power without compassion, might without morality, and strength without sight.</p> \n\n<p>Now let us begin. Now let us rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter, but beautiful, struggle for a new world. This is the calling of the sons of God, and our brothers wait eagerly for our response. Shall we say the odds are too great? Shall we tell them the struggle is too hard? Will our message be that the forces of American life militate against their arrival as full men, and we send our deepest regrets? Or will there be another message &#8212; of longing, of hope, of solidarity with their yearnings, of commitment to their cause, whatever the cost? The choice is ours, and though we might prefer it otherwise, we must choose in this crucial moment of human history.</p> \n\n<p>As that noble bard of yesterday, James Russell Lowell, eloquently stated:</p> \n\n<p>Once to every man and nation comes a moment to decide,</p> \n\n<p>In the strife of Truth and Falsehood, for the good or evil side;</p> \n\n<p>Some great cause, God&#8217;s new Messiah offering each the bloom or blight,</p> \n\n<p>And the choice goes by forever &#8216;twixt that darkness and that light.</p> \n\n<p>Though the cause of evil prosper, yet &#8217;tis truth alone is strong</p> \n\n<p>Though her portions be the scaffold, and upon the throne be wrong</p> \n\n<p>Yet that scaffold sways the future, and behind the dim unknown</p> \n\n<p>Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own.</p> \n\n<p>And if we will only make the right choice, we will be able to transform this pending cosmic elegy into a creative psalm of peace.</p> \n\n<p>If we will make the right choice, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our world into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.</p>", "title": "Remembering the Real Martin Luther King", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/remembering-the-real-martin-luther-king/", "published_at": "2008-04-04", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Particularly in the US and some European States, the Israeli and Zionist versions of history are wide-spread. Israel&#8217;s narrative relies on a collection of myths aimed at bringing the moral right and the ethical behavior of the Palestinians into twilight and making their claim to their country appear as illegitimate. Israel&#8217;s negation of Palestinian existence in the Land of Palestine is, however, a falsification of history.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Ten Myths About Israel</a>&#8221; came out in Germany in 2016 under the title &#8221; What&#8217;s wrong with Israel? The Ten Main Myths of Zionism&#8221;. The mainstream media ignored it, which could also be the case in the US. It&#8217;s sad but that how media power works in favor of Israel.</p> \n\n<p>Israeli historian Ilan Pappe, who lives in exile in Britain, deals in this book with the myths of Zionism and exposes them as legends consisting of half-truths and fabrications of history. The Zionist narrative has only little to do with historical reality and truth. <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\" /></p> \n\n<p>The &#8220;Running Gag&#8221; of the Zionist historical narrative is the story of the &#8220;empty land&#8221; of Palestine, into which people without a land had finally returned after 2000 years of exile. The slogan of a country without a people, for people without a country, is the most prominent expression of the Zionist mythology. For Pappe, it&#8217;s less important whether the Jews existed as a people, rather than that the Zionists deny the existence of a Palestinian population but simultaneously claim that the State of Israel represents all the Jews of the world and does everything for their benefit and acts for them. Such a claim is just as daring as the identification of Zionism with Judaism because it takes Jews hostage for Israel&#8217;s despising policy.</p> \n\n<p>The Zionists presented the colonization of Palestine with biblical rhetoric; this served only as a means to an end. The highest prophet of Zionism, Theodor Herzl, even considered Uganda and other places instead of the Zionist Promised Land. Finally, they found their roots in Palestine. &#8220;From then on, the Bible became both the justification and the guideline of the Zionist colonization of Palestine,&#8221; writes Pappe. He describes Zionism as a &#8220;colonial settler movement&#8221; and Israel as a &#8220;Settler Colonial State.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The author points out that the expulsion of the Palestinians in 1947/48 was &#8220;ethnic cleansing.&#8221; Likewise, the 1967 June war, which is also called the Sixth Day War, was not an act of self-defense of the &#8220;little David&#8221; against an overpowering &#8220;Goliath,&#8221; but an Israeli attack on which the Israeli security establishment has minutely prepared for years.</p> \n\n<p>The claim of being the &#8220;only democracy in the Middle East&#8221; is put in the right perspective. Israel resembles rather an &#8220;ethnocracy&#8221; than a democracy in the classical sense of the meaning. The &#8220;peace process,&#8221; which was highly praised by the Western political establishment ended in the acceleration of the colonization of Palestine and in the establishment of Palestinian regime that has to do the dirty work for Israeli occupier.</p> \n\n<p>In his book, Ilan Pappe gives his backing for the historical truth that the Israeli political establishment must face if it is interested in peace. Israel&#8217;s security establishment abuses Judaism because it equates its Zionist expansionist and oppressive policy with Judaism. Enlightenment is, therefore, more than a necessity, which the book does excellently by deconstructing the mythological web that surrounds the history of the State of Israel.</p> \n\n<p>This book is an absolute must for an interested public, the political and the media class to understand what Israel is all about.</p>", "title": "What Israel is Really All About", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2017/07/21/what-israel-is-really-all-about/", "published_at": "2017-07-21", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Last year, a couple from Australia abandoned one of the twin newborns they had commissioned from Pattharamon Chanbua, a surrogate from Thailand.

Thousands of dollars in donations poured in.</p> \n\n<p>After the international coverage, Gammy &#8212; who remains with his &#8220;surrogate&#8221; mother &#8212; was granted Australian citizenship. Because he emerged from Chanbua&#8217;s womb, however, Gammy was legally a Thai citizen as well.</p> \n\n<p>The case was more than grist for the tabloid mill. It highlighted the shortcomings of the standard discourse around surrogacy, forcing commentators to grapple with the role of prospective parents in perpetuating inequality, and the possibility that surrogacy presents many of the same moral problems as the family proper.</p> \n\n<p>While contemporary transnational surrogacy reflects global disparities in wealth and distant divisions of care labor of various kinds &#8212; Thailand is also an Australian sex-tourism epicenter &#8212; it also evokes the possibility of a different world of reproduction, premised on mutual aid and non-proprietary relations with kids.</p> \n\n<p>Because she opened her arms to Baby Gammy, Chanbua has been turned into a cardboard saint by millions of fans keen to spit on the Australian couple. But this shouldn&#8217;t minimize her and her family&#8217;s intentional, interesting, kind, and non-obvious adoptive act, which is irreducible to &#8220;maternal instinct.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It becomes easier through the Pattharamon Chanbuas of contemporary history to see what a surrogate politics might entail: an anti-proprietary, un-heterosexual mothering power.

Witness the historical phenomenon of the &#8220;motherhood strike,&#8221; embodied lately by young women in Cameroon who defied their husbands to walk in their shoes for a month; or of underground midwives operating today in North Carolina; the clandestine&amp;#160;Ireland Abortion Support Network; or any number of other collective parenting traditions.</p> \n\n<p>Radical feminists across the world focus heavily on reproductive freedom, struggling both for abortion rights and against the sterilization drives that, ironically, used to target many of those who are now surrogate workers.</p> \n\n<p>Yet the politics proper of making children, and reinventing what it means to be kin, fails to animate many radicals today &#8212; with the notable exception of the queer and trans communities, whose right to state-funded, technologically mediated procreation is contested. For them, and for anybody cast out of the nuclear family, tender attention to such questions has&amp;#160;often spelled the difference between life and death.</p> \n\n<p>From the invented homes nurtured by homeless queer youth, to the many decidedly non-nuclear household models found everywhere on earth, a wealth of practices defy the regime some have begun to call &#8220;repro-normativity&#8221; &#8212; the softly coercive culture that champions biological reproduction by straight couples as the be-all and end-all of an individual&#8217;s self-fulfillment.</p> \n\n<p>For the broader left, the intriguing problem of the family has been successfully depoliticized by, on the one hand, this mainstream repro-normative politics, and on the other, the collapse into liberalism of the spirit of the utopian communal family experiments of the sixties and seventies.</p> \n\n<p>But thinking about supplementing &#8220;kinship&#8221; with alternative, intentional, egalitarian, and gender-liberatory relations is not liberal lifestylism. New reproductive technologies could be an emancipatory terrain for existing feminisms.

Dean Heller (R-Nev.), the bill&#8217;s Republican cosponsor and one of the few GOPers to vote to move the bill towards final passage in the Senate, comes from a state with the worst unemployment rate in the United States&#8212;at 9 percent. It&#8217;s no surprise that he might vote to extend benefits to those Americans who have been out of the job for six months or more. But that doesn&#8217;t explain the no-votes from Republican Sen. Mark Kirk from Illinois, which has the fourth-worst unemployment rate&#8212;8.7 percent&#8212;and the two Republicans senators from Mississippi, which has an unemployment rate of 8.3 percent.

As always, it was great to see the concept cars of the future. But if you know me, you know I was there for news about electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrids. This is mostly just window shopping &#8212; most of the EV concept cars there are beyond a middle class budget. But then window shopping is fun, and there are some models that are becoming affordable.</p> \n\n<p>Electric vehicles are best paired with rooftop solar panels, both for price reasons and to reduce hydrocarbon use (the combination typically pays for itself in 6 years, after which the free fuel is cream). I know everyone can&#8217;t afford an EV, though they are coming down fast in price, and nor can everyone put solar panels on their roof &#8212; even assuming that they are homeowners. But for those who can, it is really important to make this switch as quickly as possible. And better, it is a quite pleasurable switch that saves a lot of money, in my experience.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>This is <a href=\"http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1096340_is-the-2016-chevy-volt-gms-future-hybrid-system-in-disguise%20\" type=\"external\">Chevrolet&#8217;s 2016 Volt</a>, which gets 50 miles on an electric charge and has been redesigned very pleasingly. It has the longest range of any plug-in hybrid (it goes to gasoline when the battery runs down). You can now fit 5 in the car, something families with 3 children had been asking for. I have the older model and I think it is a dream car&#8211; and much more affordable, with the dealer price drop the Federal tax break, than is commonly believed. I love the way it handles on the road, and the new version is even better.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/images/2015/01/DSC00934.jpg\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/images/2015/01/DSC00941.jpg\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>And here is Chevrolet&#8217;s sporty little electric Bolt concept car, which <a href=\"http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2015/01/14/chevy-bolt-electric%20\" type=\"external\">will go 200 miles on a charge and will cost $30,000</a> after rebates.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/images/2015/01/DSC00926.jpg\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>Ford has a good position as you enter the hall, so this model caught my eye first&#8211; the Fusion Energi:</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/images/2015/01/DSC00841.jpg\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>The innovative thing here is that you <a href=\"http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/2411869%20\" type=\"external\">can choose among 3 modes in which to drive, including electric-only.</a> This is an in-city commuter car, getting about 19 miles on electricity, after which it runs like an ordinary non-EV gasoline hybrid. It says it gets 88 m/hr when operating in the joint EV/ gasoline motor mode.</p> \n\n<p>Ford also displayed a purely electric Focus, which is still only a concept car and apparently won&#8217;t be on the road very soon:</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/images/2015/01/DSC00849.jpg\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>Of course, they had a Tesla S:</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/images/2015/01/DSC00865-.png\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>It goes an average 209 miles on a charge but starts at like $80,000.

Supplementing the petrol engine is an electric motor, which draws its power from a 6.2 kw/h lithium-ion battery mounted under the rear axle. Mercedes says this battery can be charged directly from a wall socket in just under two hours.</p> \n\n<p>When fully charged, the C-Class&#8217; battery pack will allow drivers to travel up to 31 km (19 mi) without help from the petrol engine, perfect for people who commute short distances around the city on a daily basis. As with plenty of other modern hybrids, the electric motor can also provide a handy power boost to the petrol engine when you want to pick up the pace.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/images/2015/01/DSC00856.jpg\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a <a href=\"http://www.bmw.com/com/en/newvehicles/i/i8/2014/showroom/\" type=\"external\">BMW i8 plug-in hybrid</a> with the DeLorean wing doors (not visible in this picture):</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/images/2015/01/DSC00888.jpg\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>An all-electric Nissan Leaf with a range of around 80 miles, though <a href=\"http://www.leftlanenews.com/next-gen-nissan-leaf-to-get-200-mile-range-to-take-on-chevy-bolt.html%20\" type=\"external\">the next generation will get 200 miles on a full charge</a> so as to compete with the Chevy Bolt (due in 2017):</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/images/2015/01/DSC00944.jpg\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>And here is a <a href=\"http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1096312_volkswagen-cross-coupe-plug-in-hybrid-concept-mid-size-suv-previewed-for-2016%20\" type=\"external\">Volkswagon concept car, a mid-size plug-in hybrid SUV, the Cross Coupe,</a> with four wheel drive.

With the fall in prices of EVs and more efficient batteries (something Tesla&#8217;s gigafactory will probably accelerate), it will make more sense to go electric. And, as solar and wind energy become dominant, the fuel will be virtually free in EV&#8217;s. Why pay for gas?</p> \n\n<p>The US produces 5.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. It is causing dangerous global warming. That needs to become zero as soon as humanly possible. Automobiles are one of the major polluters, and a quick move to EVs is essential. People are always alleging to me that it is better to have everyone move downtown in a city and use public transport. This is true, but it isn&#8217;t going to happen or at least not quickly. But, the number of EVs on the road can increase exponentially and if they are fueled from renewables, we can cut a billion or two tons of our CO2 production this way.

He knows they can afford to provide better health insurance, living wages, and affordable childcare.</p> \n\n<p>But for some reason, despite many years of what Provost Daniel Diermeier calls &#8220;continuously improv[ing] the graduate experience,&#8221; these basic benefits which our colleagues at many other institutions &#8212; including public institutions facing severe budget crises &#8212; enjoy continue to prove beyond the imagination of the UChicago administration.</p> \n\n<p>If graduate employees actually had a meaningful say in the terms of our employment by the university, we could move beyond vague promises of administration support and platitudes about the life of the mind, and actually institute policies that would allow grads &#8212; both as students and workers &#8212; to reach their full potential without worrying if they will be able to pay the thousands of dollars in medical bills, meet their rising rents, or afford child care.</p> \n\n<p>Work is something UChicago&#8217;s graduate employees are familiar with. We do a lot of it: from working in labs, to teaching courses and leading discussion sections, to running workshops and helping faculty with research and editing tasks. We hold office hours for our students, serve on committees on diversity, plan conferences, organize reading groups and film screenings, grade papers, tutor students in the writing center, and more.</p> \n\n<p>Our labor is fundamental to the basic functioning of the university and a crucial component of its intellectual life.</p> \n\n<p>Most of us are deeply invested in our work and find it personally rewarding, but we know that a life of the mind alone won&#8217;t pay our bills or ensure ideal learning conditions for our students. At issue for graduate employees are a range of issues which all center around a basic respect for our labor.</p> \n\n<p>If work is a familiar terrain to its graduate employees, remaking work is equally familiar to the University of Chicago, one of the strongest bastions of neoliberal economic thought in the United States. Since the term was coined in the 1950s, the ideas which circulated among the members of the Chicago School of Economics, including Milton Friedman, Gary Becker, and George Stigler &#8212; all of whom served as presidents of the right-wing Mont Pelerin Society &#8212; played a central role in reshaping the American economy and what it means to be a worker in the United States.</p> \n\n<p>Marrying a long tradition of individualism in American political thought to a policy program of deregulation and a globalizing world economy, these ideas have played a substantial role in stagnating wages, degrading working conditions, and cementing workforce casualization, an updated <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">logistics industry</a>, and &#8220;just-in-time&#8221; production. Most of the time, we think about these changes in the context of manufacturing, which saw corporations turn to the Global South in search of cheaper labor, but even those industries which cannot be offshored&amp;#160; have been <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">subjected to these changes</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Institutions of higher education have not been immune from this labor market restructuring. In fact, casualization of the labor force in higher education &#8212; the rise of the adjunct tier of the professoriate &#8212; and enormous increases in administrative hires mirror changes in employment in other industries. Far from being protected by our dual status as student-workers, graduate employees have suffered under the neoliberal assault on higher education.</p> \n\n<p>As Michael Billeaux and I <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">wrote</a> in 2015: &#8220;Graduate workers are on the front lines in the battle over the neoliberalization of higher education. As both students and workers, they&#8217;re doubly targeted: at the same time states and university administrations are raising tuition and fees, they&#8217;re cutting wages and benefits and weakening job protections.&#8221; These policies aren&#8217;t just the product of a few administrators, but part of an industry-wide restructuring.</p> \n\n<p>The fact that the administration&#8217;s opposition is rooted in this broader transformation of higher education in the United States &#8212; a transformation which values management over research and instruction, which sees higher education as a commodity that can be managed alongside the university&#8217;s endowment and real estate holdings &#8212; has become apparent in the extent to which the University of Chicago administration has gone to fight a decade of organizing by Graduate Students United to improve both graduate employment at the university and the UChicago community as a whole.</p> \n\n<p>Not only have they refused to voluntarily recognize our union in the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.chronicle.com/article/Ruling-Pushes-Door-to/237544\" type=\"external\">August 2016 NLRB decision</a> which once again secured our legal right to form a union, but they have fought us at every step of the way since we filed for an election after they refused to recognize the union which had been formed by a majority of the university&#8217;s graduate students. They dragged out hearings and engaged in what seemed to be a contest over which of their lawyers and administration witnesses could better insult the graduate employees who make the university run.</p> \n\n<p>And now, after they managed to stall us in hearings and delay the election by four months, they have filed another petition to prevent us from voting on October 17-18. The stakes are high for them, too: their long game is to overturn in the Columbia ruling which returned us to worker status under the NLRA last year &#8212; a prospect that appears to be a matter of if rather than when.</p> \n\n<p>In a recent email to the university&#8217;s academic employees, Provost Diermeier claims that the administration &#8220;respect the divergent viewpoints that exist on this topic [grad unionization]&#8221; and suggests that the administration encourages &#8220;the expression of those viewpoints in rigorous and mutually respectful debate.&#8221; But listening to the approach the administration and its lawyers took in our hearings before the NLRB, it was hard to feel respected.</p> \n\n<p>We listened to lawyers perform linguistic gymnastics in order to suggest that graduate employees &#8220;are not working. They are teaching,&#8221; and weren&#8217;t really employees because &#8220;most of their experiments fail,&#8221; (which, in addition to being insulting, also demonstrated a clear misunderstanding of the process of scientific research).</p> \n\n<p>In the most generous reading, the administration&#8217;s lawyers and the faculty they called to testify seemed ignorant of or misinformed about the amount of work graduate employees actually do, claiming that we do not hold office hours, do not substitute for faculty during TAships, and do not design syllabi.</p> \n\n<p>They claimed that research assisting that graduate employees in labs do was different that the work of an employee lab assistant. But even where they acknowledged the actual place of graduate employees in the research and teaching mission of the university, they tried to suggest that our contributions were suspect, inferior, and more a hindrance than a help.</p> \n\n<p>Dean Anne Walters Robertson of the Humanities Division claimed that it didn&#8217;t really benefit her to have grads lead discussion sections. Then-dean, now-Executive Vice Provost David Nirenberg suggested that the hours graduate employees dedicate to teaching resulted in inferior education for our students, and that graduate employees assisting professors in their courses were more of a hindrance than a help &#8212; stating, in words that have become infamous among University of Chicago TAs, &#8220;Having someone grading is not a relief to me.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>This does not, however, seem to be the majority opinion of the faculty. But the administration&#8217;s legal team chose not showcase the diverse ideas they claim to support. Instead, they declined to call faculty witnesses who believed that the work of graduate employees is fundamental to the basic functioning of the university and a core part of the university&#8217;s intellectual community.</p> \n\n<p>Fortunately, many faculty support the graduate students they work with, value our contributions to the university, and respect our right to unionize because of it. Many of these faculty volunteered to testify to it on our behalf. As mathematics professor Denis Hirschfeldt stated in his hearing testimony, &#8220;Our undergraduate mathematics program could not possibly be run anywhere near the way it is without graduate student work.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He was echoed by Anton Ford, a faculty member in the department of philosophy: &#8220;We don&#8217;t have enough faculty to teach those classes [small, focused seminars] as well as the big lecture courses that we&#8217;re responsible for doing, so if it weren&#8217;t for these graduate students, the majors would not have access to small seminars.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>This industry-wide restructuring raises the stakes for unionization, especially at a place like the University of Chicago, one of the nation&#8217;s elite &#8220;Ivy-Plus&#8221; institutions that sets standards for the rest of academia. Improving graduate employment here can help improve working conditions at other private universities where graduate employees have not yet unionized as well as help to normalize collective bargaining as a standard part of academic life in the private sector &#8212; as it already is for many of our colleagues at public institutions &#8212; including the nation&#8217;s &#8220;Public Ivies&#8221; like the University of California, the University of Wisconsin, and the University of Michigan &#8212; and internationally.</p> \n\n<p>The struggle to unionize the nation&#8217;s private-sector graduate employees, as well as a new layer of public-sector grads at places like Mizzou, has impacts far beyond our years as graduate students. The all-but-collapse of the academic job market (a friend who recently received his PhD has yet to see a job posted in his field for this year&#8217;s job search) means that many of us look forward to a career of adjuncting. Increasingly, universities are investing in programs that encourage students to look for employment beyond academia &#8212; when as recently as five years ago, the subject of the &#8220;alt-ac&#8221; track was taboo in many departments. Particularly for graduate employees of color, these disparities in employment have magnified effects.</p> \n\n<p>The experience of building solidarity and bargaining collectively to improve our working conditions in graduate school must be carried into our post-graduate employment, where groundbreaking research, exceptional teaching, and impeccable service records have not been enough to stave off casualization. We do not live in a society that values the work of higher education; like all workers, we must fight to win the respect deserve.</p> \n\n<p>The University of Chicago has poured untold amounts of money into a decade of opposition to our effort to form a legally recognized union that would allow us to collectively improve our institution. Since we filed for an election this spring, they have done everything in their power to stop us from voting. But you can&#8217;t have &#8220;rigorous and mutually respectful debate&#8221; &#8212; which the administration claims to aspire to &#8212; when one side has billions of dollars at its disposal and the other side worry if they will be able to afford to go to the doctor if they get sick. Through collective bargaining, graduate employees would finally have meaningful input into the issues that matter most to our lives and work.</p>", "title": "Trump vs. Graduate Workers", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://jacobinmag.com/2017/10/university-chicago-graduate-union-trump-nlra", "published_at": "2018-10-02", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>New at Mother Jones:</p> \n\n<p>U.S. forces in Iraq recently uncovered an Iraqi-run torture center in Baghdad.

Frogs have the sense to hop out of heating pots. We Americans don&#8217;t. Degree by degree over decades, we&#8217;ve been scalded senseless. It is time to snap out of our stupor.</p> \n\n<p>Consider the ironies.</p> \n\n<p>Back in 1967, I went to the Congo and then kept going, curious to find the strangest society on earth. These days, I could just stay home.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Americans in the 70s loved the Waltons, a hardscrabble West Virginia fictional family who fed any stranger at the door. Today, six real Waltons are worth $115 billion, more than the bottom third of the nation. For one of their Walmart peons, that is seven million years of base pay.</p> \n\n<p>No one thought about climate then. Water made headlines in 1972 but only with &#8220;gate&#8221; attached to it. Reporters revealed Richard Nixon burgled the Democrats&#8217; Watergate offices. Outraged citizens impeached him. Today, most of us just shrug when we learn how the White House snoops on us all.</p> \n\n<p>Congress cripples essential services to save a few trillion dollars over 10 years. We squandered twice that on two unwinnable wars, despite the lessons of Vietnam, only to make yet more people hate us. Iraqi oil now goes to China.</p> \n\n<p>When allies who need our leadership warn that we are bumbling toward the scrapheap of ex-empires, we wave bigger flags. If sovereign states thwart us, our generals fondle their drones.</p> \n\n<p>We vaunt our generosity but, per capita, our foreign aid is the stingiest among rich nations. As George Packer notes in the New Yorker, it is &#8220;an awkward exercise of high-minded self-interest, humanitarian goals uneasily balanced with strategic calculations.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>At home, we take comfort in our bedrock strength, defended over centuries: our freedoms to choose. Yet we allow ourselves to be fleeced by partisan politics and a tiny fringe of big-money players.</p> \n\n<p>Two pals visiting from Arizona offered a diagnosis. Workaday Americans, overwhelmed, focus on their own narrow bread-and-circus worlds. Kids, seeing bullshit all around them, thumb alternative realities on tiny screens. The way out, my friends conclude, is to build awareness and incrementally spur action.</p> \n\n<p>That is like a flight crew&#8217;s directions as a troubled airliner nears a mountain: Buckle up, lean forward, and kiss your ass goodbye.</p> \n\n<p>We need to move fast, as a collective. We can each act locally, but we&#8217;ve got to think on a planetary plane. Borders in today&#8217;s world are only lines on a map.</p> \n\n<p>For starters, let&#8217;s face reality. Sure, we&#8217;re a great nation. But I&#8217;d love to see Alexis de Tocqueville back for an update at a Phoenix mall among feckless golden youth. Or at a Tucson gun show where old guys in boots arm themselves for Armageddon.</p> \n\n<p>Tocqueville came in 1831 to see how France might improve its prisons. Now I could show him Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio&#8217;s pink-clad inmates frying in summer sun. He would find we lock up 760 of every 100,000 inhabitants, seven times France&#8217;s rate, more than Cuba and China combined.</p> \n\n<p>He marveled at how people stayed free and happy by holding governments to account. When citizens grow apathetic, he wrote, democracies slide toward &#8220;soft despotism,&#8221; and majorities tyrannize minorities. (He&#8217;d likely be amused by our term, sequester. In French, sequestrer means kidnap.)</p> \n\n<p>We are no longer so exceptional. In a lot of countries any kid can grow up to be president. An American must raise a billion dollars and show Donald Trump a birth certificate. We sneer at others&#8217; corruption, yet ours is built into our institutions. Special interests can legally rent all the legislators they need.</p> \n\n<p>Obsessed with ourselves, we don&#8217;t see how others view our violence. A terrorist band killed 3,000 people in 2001, and we still rain fire halfway around the world. Our guns at home take 11,000 lives each year. In Japan, by contrast, gun deaths totaled seven in 2012, two fewer than deaths by scissors.</p> \n\n<p>Here are some urgent priorities:</p> \n\n<p>&#8211;First, we need a firm grip on global realities. That requires professional reporters along with thoughtful readers who absorb what they report. Today&#8217;s avalanche of &#8220;news&#8221; from multiple directions would be great if we knew what to trust. Mostly, it only confuses us. Good stuff gets lost in a tower of babble.</p> \n\n<p>Too often, we reduce &#8220;news&#8221; to nuggets that feed prejudice and agenda. Example: It was senseless to fixate on the Benghazi calamity. No government can field enough agents and troops to secure countless far-flung snake pits. We need to reduce frustrations that breed enemies who target easy prey.</p> \n\n<p>&#8211;Second, we have to elect people who remember their oaths of office. Here is Robert Reich: &#8220;Conservative Republicans&#8230;basically shut Congress down. Their refusal to compromise is working just as they hoped: No jobs agenda. No budget. No grand bargain on the deficit. No background checks on guns. Nothing on climate change. No tax reform. No hike in the minimum wage. Nothing so far on immigration reform.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Our legislators do not shoot their way into office. We vote them in, and we can bounce them out when they put their own interests ahead of ours. We need to undo gerrymandering that lets minorities hold majorities for ransom.</p> \n\n<p>&#8211;Third, we need to realize that in the long run schools matter most. When I start a class, I&#8217;m always stunned at how little 21-year-old journalism students know about the world they are about to inherit. At the end, I&#8217;m thrilled at how eager they are to keep learning more. That interest should start in third grade.</p> \n\n<p>Each Reaper drone missile load costs at least $320,000, enough to hire a handful of teachers who can explain to future generations why it is a bad idea to blow up distant strangers. If some kids disagree, fair enough, as long as facts, context, and critical thinking factor into the process.</p> \n\n<p>Half a century of poking into other societies has shown me that people are more alike than they are different. They know injustice when they see it, social and otherwise. Muscular nations with big appetites need to keep that in mind.</p> \n\n<p>Latin America is finally narrowing the rich-poor gap. Ours widens. Corporations rule. Banks we bailed out squeeze us at every turn. Other nations see health care as a human right. Our version enriches insurance companies, overburdens doctors, and does little for many it was meant to help.</p> \n\n<p>This is no commie rant. I reported from the Evil Empire when it collapsed. Soviet socialism didn&#8217;t kill it. People finally had enough of leaders who used state power to favor a chosen few and quell dissent. Sound familiar?</p> \n\n<p>But only half of us even bother to vote, let alone protest. Look how Turks reacted when the prime minister tried to make Taksim Square into a shopping mall.</p> \n\n<p>Wherever I go, friends tell me they miss what America was and could be. Gustavo Gorriti, the most respected reporter in Peru, sent chills up my spine.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I admire the United States profoundly,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some of my best years were spent there.&#8221; Like so many others, he studied the American style of journalism that set the world standard. Now, he says, that is over.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We now all pay the price of your having devastated real newspapers,&#8221; he said. As he sees it, few Americans realize that a complex public-private universe operates over their heads. When an Edward Snowden attempts to shed some light, he is hounded as a traitor into the enemy camp.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Orwell would have thought this was too crazy for his novels,&#8221; Gorriti said. He fears Europe is being muscled to follow along, eroding democratic foundations built up over centuries.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;There has to be a reaction from the people,&#8221; he concluded. &#8220;Americans have to take their country back. If people don&#8217;t act in the United States, in Europe, we are going to lose the greatest achievement of human history.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Farfetched? Orwell wrote &#8220;1984&#8221; on the Scottish island of Jura. Just recently, the BBC reported, Jura vanished from view. Google inexplicably wiped it off the map. This was later corrected, but the point was made. When virtual replaces real, anything is possible.</p> \n\n<p>We need to bang away at family and friends and then widen our circles. TV won&#8217;t help much. John-Boy Walton narrated how Franklin Roosevelt shepherded America out of the Great Depression. Today we have faux reality and that porcine putz with preposterous hair on Celebrity Apprentice, who takes such delight in bellowing, &#8220;You&#8217;re fired.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>People can be inspired. St&#233;phane Hessel, in his 90s, sold four million copies worldwide of a pamphlet, Indignez-vous! Roughly, Get Off Your Butt. Then he wrote Engagez-vous. Stay Off Your Butt, and Keep At It.</p> \n\n<p>Hessel was French but his message was universal. He advocates simple firm action, not violence. Civil disobedience only incites police to break heads. We need to understand that those cops work for us. And so does Congress.</p> \n\n<p>In America, if a 99 percent majority cannot revive a hallmark democracy and a free-choice economy, that metaphoric frog has already croaked.</p> \n\n<p>Mort Rosenblum, former Associated Press special correspondent and ex-editor of the International Herald Tribune, jabs a Quixote lance at world failings in his spare moments.

According to most reviewers, in lieu of a plot the film offers &#8220;rambling incoherence&#8221; and &#8220;incomprehensible dialogue.&#8221; It is &#8220;an exercise in self-indulgence.&#8221; Several reviewers have actually worried in print that Dylan made the movie in order to have some kind of joke at their expense. Dylan&#8217;s character, Jack Fate, has little or nothing to say, we are repeatedly told, and more or less just &#8220;sits there like a toad,&#8221; in the words of Roger Ebert, who should be the last person to accuse anyone of that.</p> \n\n<p>Could the movie really be this bad? It wouldn&#8217;t matter if it were equal to &#8220;The Tempest&#8221; or &#8220;Julius Caesar,&#8221; it has already been pronounced D.O.A.</p> \n\n<p>Anytime the nation&#8217;s media are this unanimous about anything, one would do well to be suspicious. After all, President Bush&#8217;s decision to invade Iraq in search of &#8220;weapons of mass destruction&#8221; was met not with skepticism but with near-unanimous cheerleading and boosterizing in the corporate media.</p> \n\n<p>Reviewers had already effectively killed Dylan&#8217;s film by the time it arrived in Portland, Oregon for a perfunctory one-week run. Although attendance grew steadily during the week, it started sparse and grew toward respectable.</p> \n\n<p>Not ten minutes after the opening credits I could see why the film had been marked for assassination by big newspaper media critics. They are the villains of the piece! &#8220;Masked and Anonymous&#8221; portrays the reporters who wrote the bad reviews as people who have to wear ankle monitors. Editors hold the keys that control them. Who owns the editors is pretty clear, too. The sight of superstar critic and Sixties specialist &#8220;Tom Friend&#8221; (Jeff Bridges) being beaten to death with Blind Lemon Jefferson&#8217;s guitar must have been too much for them.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Friend,&#8221; obsessed with his own memories of the Sixties but oblivious to what is going on outside the window, never seems to notice that Fate, his quarry, answers none of his questions.</p> \n\n<p>Officials of the &#8220;network&#8221; televising the &#8220;benefit&#8221; on which Fate is to appear see him as self-indulgent, too. They want him to sing &#8220;Jailhouse Rock,&#8221; &#8220;Jumping Jack Flash&#8221; and &#8220;Revolution &#8212; the slow version.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He gives them &#8220;Dixie.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The infamous &#8220;rambling and incomprehensible&#8221; plot is in fact rather well-constructed and makes abundant sense. Although the project could have used some tighter editing and more attention to minor issues of continuity, anyone who couldn&#8217;t follow this movie probably couldn&#8217;t be trusted with a comic book. The storyline is no more &#8220;obscure&#8221; or &#8220;disjointed&#8221; than &#8220;A Hard Day&#8217;s Night.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But it hits a great deal harder. When the camera pans slowly down a desolate L.A. avenue, and Dylan is heard singing &#8220;Seen the arrow on the doorpost, saying This Land is Condemned, all the way from New Orleans to Jerusalem,&#8221; try to keep tears from welling. (Or sit there like a toad eating popcorn and stuff the feeling, it&#8217;s your call.)</p> \n\n<p>Whereas the concert finale of &#8220;A Hard Day&#8217;s Night&#8221; is witnessed by screaming teenagers and an adoring TV audience, the concert performed by Fate in &#8220;Masked and Anonymous&#8221; is seen by no one except stage hands and extras because it is pre-empted by a presidential speech and interrupted by guns and bayonets.</p> \n\n<p>In spite of what you may have read, the film is not &#8220;set in some imaginary third-world country at some point in the future,&#8221; anymore than King Lear is about prehistoric England. Failure to recognize the true setting should immediately disqualify any reviewer. &#8220;Masked and Anonymous&#8221; is a spot-on accurate portrayal of what is going on RIGHT NOW, seen through the eyes of someone with vision and not just eyesight, someone who has looked through the eyes not only of Charley Patton and Elizabeth Cotton but also of Emmett Miller and even Daniel Decatur Emmett.</p> \n\n<p>All America&#8217;s chicken-hawk foreign wars have come home to roost. The horrors once visited upon El Salvador, Nicaragua, Vietnam, Somalia and Iraq are now rolling through the streets of California. All the electoral disgrace of recent campaigns has been compressed into one presidential speech. As for the major media as portrayed in this film, it is impossible not to think of Christiane Amanpour&#8217;s recent admission that CNN &#8220;was intimidated&#8221; by the Bush administration and operated in a &#8220;climate of fear and self-censorship&#8221; during the invasion of Iraq.</p> \n\n<p>When the new president (Mickey Roarke) concludes his &#8220;war-is-peace&#8221; oration at the end of the film with the sarcastic words &#8220;May God help you all,&#8221; it is merely what anyone with a perceptive imagination can hear Bush or Cheney saying when they conclude their speeches with the formulaic &#8220;God Bless America.&#8221; Certainly the administration portrayed in &#8220;Masked and Anonymous&#8221; is no more thuggish than the one currently rooting at the trough in Washington.</p> \n\n<p>Or, as Uncle Sweetheart (John Goodman) puts it, &#8220;It&#8217;s the dark princes, the democratic republicans, working for a barbarian who can scarcely spell his own name.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>When a soldier (Giovanni Ribisi) tells Fate of fighting first with the rebels, then with the counter-insurgents, then with the Government, then with the rebels again, only to discover that some of the rebels are in fact funded by the very Government they&#8217;re supposed to be opposing, how strange does that seem to anyone familiar with the betrayals and capitulations of contemporary politics, especially movement politics? It&#8217;s like finding out who sponsors &#8220;Earth Day.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>My favorite exchange: &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to be on your side, Jack,&#8221; says Uncle Sweetheart, the promoter who is, naturally, &#8220;only trying to help.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;You have to be born on my side, Sweetheart,&#8221; says Fate.</p> \n\n<p>To be on the side of workers, of animals, of oppressed people, of love, of the truth is to court destruction. Before singing his final song and meeting his own fate, Jack Fate experiences a visitation by his ghostly forerunner, Oscar Vogel (Ed Harris), a banjo-playing entertainer who worked in blackface and who disappeared after raising his voice against the times. When Fate looks back to catch a last glimpse of Vogel, the vaudevillian has been replaced by a young Black man who could be a janitor, a Reggae artist or a rising Hip-Hop truth teller, next in the line of destiny, or line of fire.</p> \n\n<p>This film isn&#8217;t perfect. I have read the original screenplay and far too much has been cut out of it to try to make it acceptable to people who would have had none of it under any circumstances. But it is the only motion picture I have seen so far in this millennium that seems to have a clue about what is going on in America. Moviegoers will get it or they won&#8217;t. Great pains have been taken to ensure that they won&#8217;t even see it.</p> \n\n<p>It is a tale of almost unbearable sadness and loss. When Dylan sings &#8220;I&#8217;ll Remember You,&#8221; as electrifying a performance as has ever been caught on camera (all the songs are performed live, there&#8217;s no lip-synching in this movie) you feel that he may well be singing not merely about a person but also about that &#8220;lost America of love&#8221; that Ginsberg mourned in &#8220;A Supermarket in California,&#8221; a work that in its visionary aspect and intensity &#8220;Masked and Anonymous&#8221; resembles. (Its ultimate antecedents are of course Shakespeare&#8217;s history plays.)</p> \n\n<p>When Dylan&#8217;s character, Fate, is reunited with his lost/doomed love (Angela Bassett, magnificent in the role), she endeavors with great tenderness to console him for his losses, and without a word Dylan manages to convey that Fate&#8217;s grief is inconsolable. It is a scene of considerable beauty and delicacy.</p> \n\n<p>Dylan&#8217;s performance has been called &#8220;inscrutable.&#8221; But who else could have played this role? There are people who find his songs inscrutable as well, and I suppose arguing with them would be as pointless as trying to answer &#8220;Tom Friend&#8217;s&#8221; interview questions.

One may argue endlessly about those matters.&amp;#160; But they are China&#8217;s internal affairs, and for a genuine anti-interventionist they are none of our government&#8217;s business and have no place in setting foreign policy.&amp;#160; There is a world of difference between an anti-interventionist and an advocate for &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; imperialism, witting or not.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; How does an anti-interventionist look at China?</p> \n\n<p>Let us begin with some stubborn, cold hard facts about the US and China.&amp;#160; In very round numbers the world&#8217;s annual GDP is about $ 60 trillion.&amp;#160; That of the U.S. is $15 trillion, that of the EU is $15 trillion, that of China and Japan about $5 trillion each, with China about to pull a bit ahead of Japan this year.&amp;#160; The per capita GDP of the U.S. is about $46,000 and that of China is about $4000.&amp;#160; In sum, China is still a developing country although one with a very large aggregate GDP.&amp;#160; It is number two to the US but not a close number two, and it trails the developed world considerably in its standard of living.</p> \n\n<p>What about trade?&amp;#160; Is China not the world&#8217;s largest exporter?&amp;#160; Yes, it is; but until last year, it was number two; Germany was number one - and Germany has slipped now to number two.&amp;#160; So Germany with its high wages and generous social benefits was able to outdo both the U.S. and China in exports until recently.&amp;#160; How did Germany do this?&amp;#160; By exporting high quality, high tech and well-branded goods.&amp;#160; (Germany has not outsourced production to other countries as has the US.)&amp;#160; In fact as China came into the number one exporter spot, its leaders proclaimed that they were not really number one but number one only in quantity.&amp;#160; They said China&#8217;s goal was to follow in Germany&#8217;s path to become an exporter of &#8220;high tech, high quality, well-branded goods.&#8221;&amp;#160; Why cannot the U.S. do this instead of blaming China for its unemployment.</p> \n\n<p>What about China as a military &#8220;threat&#8221; to the U.S.?&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The US now spends about $1 trillion a year on &#8220;national security,&#8221; a staggering 1 dollar in 15 of our total GDP and 1 dollar in 60 of the world&#8217;s GDP, a colossal waste.&amp;#160; And that does not include the military spending forced upon our &#8220;allies,&#8221; the NATO countries, South Korea, Japan and now India.&amp;#160; Simply to equal US military spending alone China would have to spend 20 per cent of its GDP on the military, an impossibility unless development is forsaken.&amp;#160; Its navy is not powerful but soon it will at least be able to patrol and defend the nearby seas.&amp;#160; Most assuredly the US will not for long be able to sail aircraft carriers within sight of China&#8217;s shores - and that is to the good.&amp;#160; It will make for less tension.&amp;#160; Consider how the US would react if a Chinese fleet were conducting maneuvers within sight of Los Angeles or Seattle.</p> \n\n<p>Next let us consider U.S. military doctrine in the ways it might affect relations with China.&amp;#160; U.S. doctrine is clear and unchanging from one administration to the next since the end of the Cold War.&amp;#160; No country is to be allowed to come close to the U.S. in military might.&amp;#160; The most explicit statement of this came in the Defense Planning Guide for 1994-1999, a secret document prepared in 1992 and leaked to the NYT and Washington Post. &#8220;Our first objective,&#8221; the highly classified document stated, &#8220;is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival, either on the territory of the former Soviet Union or elsewhere, that poses a threat on the order of that posed formerly by the Soviet Union.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>From the outset Obama has left no doubt that the policy of permanent military superiority continues under him, proclaiming just after his election, on the occasion of appointing his &#8220;foreign policy team&#8221; of Clinton, Gates, and others: &#8220;?we all share the belief we have to maintain the strongest military on the planet.&#8221; Just last week Pentagon chief, Robert Gates, declared in a speech in Tokyo that the 47,000 troops in Japan were there to &#8220;keep China&#8217;s rising power in check&#8221; and so will remain for the indefinite future .&amp;#160; One must also conclude that the wars in Central Asia and the implantation of US bases there, right on China&#8217;s back doorstep, and the courting of India over the past ten years are also part of the &#8220;containment&#8221; policy, whatever other purposes those wars and bases may have. This dimension of the U.S. wars is rarely discussed in the mainstream or liberal press.</p> \n\n<p>The implications of this doctrine are pernicious in the extreme.&amp;#160; First, the very threat encourages those who might want to be friends to arm themselves to preserve their independence and sovereignty.&amp;#160; Second and much more important, military might grows out of economic power, as we have known at least since Thucydides.&amp;#160; Thus the US is declaring that China cannot have a total GDP which comes close to that of the US.&amp;#160; Let us consider the consequences of that.&amp;#160; What would it mean for China if it achieved an aggregate GDP not larger that of the US but simply the same size? Quite simply, since China has four or five times our population, it would mean that China would have a per capita GDP one fourth of ours - or about $10,000 a year.&amp;#160; That means unending poverty for the Chinese people. Thus China is forced to choose between poverty or provoking the ire of the U.S.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Such is the iron logic of US military policy.</p> \n\n<p>The U.S. must either content itself to be eclipsed by China in the economic and therefore military sphere if indeed China continues to be successful in developing - or prevent China from rising to the standard of living in Europe and the U.S.&amp;#160; That is the meaning of the policy of &#8220;containing China.&#8221;&amp;#160; Sadly this policy also forecloses a win-win outcome whereby China and the US and the entire globe prosper.&amp;#160; US policy dictates a win-lose outcome. Such is the bellicose strategy and dismal future dictated by US military policy. And in the sweet talk from Obama and Clinton leading up to the visit of President Hu Jintao of China, there has been no suggestion of a change in U.S. military policy, not even a hint of such a change.&amp;#160; It is long overdue.</p> \n\n<p>John V.

On&amp;#160;Wednesday, a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that the portion of the 2010 health reform law that requires Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty is constitutional.</p> \n\n<p>The decision came in response to an appeal by the conservative Thomas More Law Center in Michigan. A judge in the federal district court in Detroit <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/08/health/policy/08health.html\" type=\"external\">ruled last October</a> that the &#8220;mandate&#8221; portion of the law was, in fact, constitutional, but Thomas More appealed to the 6th&amp;#160;Circuit.</p> \n\n<p>There are still two decisions pending from other appeals courts regarding portions of the health care law: the 4th Circuit in Richmond and the 11th Circuit in Atlanta.

The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/us/30health.html\" type=\"external\">New York Times explains</a>:</p> \n\n<p>Lawyers on both sides of the case widely expect the Supreme Court to take one or more of the cases, perhaps as soon as its coming term, which starts in October.

Two of the judges on the panel were appointed by Republican presidents and one was appointed by a Democrat. At the lower District Court level, five judges have divided on the question, with three Democratic appointees ruling in favor of the law and two Republican appointees rejecting it.</p> \n\n<p>The law might not fare as well in the other appeals courts, both of which are expected to rule soon.

These were not &#8220;jihadists&#8221; in the current parlance of the Global War on Terror, but revolutionaries fighting for the return of an exiled people to their homeland &#8212; and to build a radical non-sectarian democratic state in Palestine.</p> \n\n<p>The film is both a resurrection of that era and a self-conscious meditation on the efforts of the Palestinian film makers to produce a representation of the struggle in their own terms during the 1960s and 1970s.&amp;#160; The memory of the period is reanimated through what was on film and a critical reflection on what was outside it &#8211; or &#8220;off Frame,&#8221; as the title indicates.&amp;#160; &#8220;Revolution Until Victory&#8221; was a popular slogan among Palestinian resistors.</p> \n\n<p>The documentary is based on the director&#8217;s rediscovery of the work of the PLO&#8217;s Palestine Film Unit through sometimes grainy prints surviving in archives around the world.&amp;#160; The original negatives, like much of the documentary record of the Palestine resistance, were lost in the intentional destruction of the PLO archives by the Israeli invaders of Lebanon in 1982.</p> \n\n<p>The film begins with stills and newsreel clips of British Mandatory Palestine, ending in the expulsion of at least 750,000 Palestinians from their homes to refugee camps, first of tents and then with more permanent, though still impoverished housing as the years went by. &amp;#160;Yaqubi reveals again and again in contemporary documentary and PLO propaganda footage how the Palestinians struggled to create their own narrative and gradually transformed from victims to resistors, from exiles to self-conscious freedom fighters.&amp;#160; In the words of author and historian Elias Sandbar &#8220;For people who suffer from invisibility, the camera would be their weapon.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The struggle against historical &#8220;erasure&#8221; is one thread that animated Palestinian resistance throughout those years and it continues to this day.&amp;#160; A segment of Yaqubi&#8217;s film reproduces clips from a PLO documentary response to Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir&#8217;s infamous 1969 statement that &#8220;The Palestinians Do Not Exist.&#8221;&amp;#160; &amp;#160;In 2011 former House Speaker and presidential aspirant Newt Gingrich called the Palestinians an &#8220;invented people.&#8221;&amp;#160; A few years later, influential billionaire Republican funder (and &#8220;Friend of Bibi&#8221;) Sheldon Adelson asserted that the Palestinians were &#8220;a made-up nation&#8221; and his campaign donations have helped to make this a near universal dogma on the Conservative Right.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Revolution Until Victory&#8221; is also a vivid reminder that the image projected by the PLO in those days was defiantly leftist and secular.&amp;#160; Scenes of fighters (men and women) are interspersed with clips of people learning how to read, weapons shown alongside books and teachers citing Che Guevara on revolution and love. &amp;#160;The analysis portrayed in the clips is overtly Marxist. Everyone from Arafat to individual fighters speaking about the struggle as one for liberation, not against &#8220;the Jews&#8221; but for a free Palestine where everyone could live in peace.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;It was a cause &#8211; along with the contemporary Vietnam War &#8211; that resonated among prominent radicals across the world. We see clips of international celebrities like filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard and actress Vanessa Redgrave. As well as footage narrated in French and Italian. &amp;#160;(Writer Jean Genet&#8217;s posthumous work &#8220;A Prisoner of Love&#8221; would document his meditation on the time he spent with Palestinian fighters in the 1970s.)</p> \n\n<p>In the late 1970s Palestinians trained together with South African ANC fighters, Mozambican FRELIMO and ZAPU (Zimbabwe) troops, alongside Lebanese Communists in Algerian and Soviet military camps.&amp;#160; An ANC soldier I knew in Zambia during the 1980s was called &#8220;Ya Habibi&#8221; by his comrades (and also years later on the streets of Pretoria when he became a colonel in the new South African Army) because that is how they heard him greeted by PLO fighters in the same Crimean training camp.</p> \n\n<p>In retrospect, of course, it was unlikely that Palestinian freedom fighters alone could ever have defeated the mighty Israeli military machine, armed and supported by the US and its allies.&amp;#160; Palestine was not Vietnam.&amp;#160; But the PLO armed resistance &#8211; like the ANC&#8217;s during the same period &#8211; played an important role in bolstering morale among the Palestinians under occupation and in the diaspora.&amp;#160; Without it the Intifadas of the 1980s in Palestine and South Africa might not have been possible. In the case of Apartheid South Africa the result was the growth of an unstoppable internal resistance and powerful international sanctions that brought about a democratic de-colonization.&amp;#160; Palestinians are still waiting.</p> \n\n<p>But, as filmmaker Yaqubi has written: &#8220;Resorting to cinema&#8217;s temporal nature and time being an elastic concept, Off Frame&#8221; assumes the role of a time machine. . .&amp;#160; by opening a portal into the life, hopes and desires of a people living in a revolution, fighting to be recognized and to reclaim control over their representation.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The film ends on a hopeful contemporary note.&amp;#160; Interspersed with the final credits are scenes from a classroom in contemporary Ramallah where the teacher and students (boys and girls together) speak about &#8220;peace with dignity.&#8221;&amp;#160; On the walls are photos of Yasser Arafat and the poet Mahmoud Darwish.&amp;#160; As the last credits roll, a student assembly salutes the Palestinian flag, accompanied by the strains of the stirring Palestinian anthem&amp;#160;Biladi&amp;#160;&#8211; &#8220;My Land.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Jeff Klein&amp;#160;is a frequent visitor to the Middle East, a speaker and author of many articles on regional issues and Palestine-Israel.&amp;#160; In the 1980s he worked for the exiled African National Congress in Zambia.&amp;#160; He has an occasional blog:&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://atmyangle.blogspot.com/\" type=\"external\">At a slight angle to the universe</a>.</p> \n\n<p>The Film will be shown on Sunday, October 22 as part of the&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Boston Palestine Film Festival.</a></p>", "title": "\u201cRevolution Until Victory:\u201d a New Film About the Palestine Liberation Struggle", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2017/10/13/revolution-until-victory-a-new-film-about-the-palestine-liberation-struggle/", "published_at": "2017-10-13", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Dili, Timor-Leste.</p> \n\n<p>Recently, thousands of U.S. military veterans travelled to North Dakota to support the peaceful struggle of the Standing Rock Sioux to defend their sovereignty and protect their land and water. I watched the veterans bend down to ask forgiveness from the many indigenous tribes gathered there. They apologized as veterans from the same military that has carried out genocide against Native Americans since before the U.S. achieved independence. In this way, they acknowledged the past and affirmed their commitment to ensuring the bitter past doesn&#8217;t repeat itself.</p> \n\n<p>This December 7, I bent down in Timor-Leste to apologize for the crimes of my government against the East Timorese people. On that day in 1975, U.S.-armed and -trained Indonesian troops launched their illegal invasion. I feel a deep sadness and shame that my government has not yet formally and responsibly acknowledged its support for crimes committed here on that day and the 24-year Indonesian occupation which followed. An important first step would be for the U.S. to declassify and release all its records related to Indonesia and its invasion and occupation of Timor-Leste.</p> \n\n<p>As a citizen of the United States, I have a responsibility to learn and respond to injustices done by my own government. While my government would prefer not to emphasize or even acknowledge this past, I can still access this information, and I can speak freely. I am obligated to act when I see injustice &#8211; to use nonviolent means to prevent, reduce or acknowledge my complicity in my government&#8217;s actions.</p> \n\n<p>In the U.S., most people know December 7 as Pearl Harbor Day, the anniversary of the 1941 Japanese bombing of a U.S. Navy base in Hawaii. Japan&#8217;s target was strictly military, and the pre-emptive strike was carried out because Japan believed that the U.S. was close to joining the war. In contrast, Indonesia&#8217;s invasion of Timor-Leste was an attack on a civilian population who did not want war with Indonesia. Most people in the U.S. don&#8217;t know about Timor-Leste, but the Indonesian invasion could not have happened without the military, economic and diplomatic backing of the U.S.</p> \n\n<p>From December 6, 1975, until 1999, the U.S. supported Indonesia&#8217;s invasion and occupation. For this, they are responsible for numerous serious crimes committed here.</p> \n\n<p>Some basic facts:</p> \n\n<p>+ December 6, 1975: President Gerald Ford <a href=\"http://www.etan.org/issues/kissinger.htm\" type=\"external\">and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger</a> met with Suharto in Jakarta and gave a green light to the invasion.</p> \n\n<p>+&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">December 7</a>, 1975: Indonesia launched the invasion; 90% of the weapons used came from the U.S.</p> \n\n<p>+ December 1975-1976: President Ford&#8217;s Ambassador to the UN <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">, Daniel Patrick Moynihan</a>, wrote proudly that the U.S. wanted the UN to be &#8220;utterly ineffective in whatever measures it undertook [on Timor-Leste], &#8230;and I carried it forward with no inconsiderable success.&#8221; From 1976 to 1983, the U.S. voted against every General Assembly resolution supporting Timor-Leste.</p> \n\n<p>+ January 1976: A U.S. State Department official stated: &#8220;In terms of the bilateral relations between the U.S. and Indonesia, we are more or less condoning the incursion into East Timor&#8230;. The United States wants to keep its relations with Indonesia close and friendly. [It&#8217;s] a nation we do a lot of business with.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>+ 1977: <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">President Jimmy Carter</a> (known by many as &#8216;the human rights president&#8217;) increased military aid to Indonesia, including authorizing an additional $112 million worth of weapons. U.S. support for the occupation continued under the Reagan and Bush administrations of the 1980s.</p> \n\n<p>+ December 10, 1991: A month after the notorious <a href=\"http://www.etan.org/factsheets/santa_cruz.htm\" type=\"external\">Santa Cruz massacre</a> in Dili, capitol of Timor-Leste &#8211; witnessed by U.S. journalists Amy Goodman and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Allan Nairn</a> &#8212; U.S. officials met with Indonesian military leaders to reinforce their support, telling them: &#8220;We do not believe that friends should abandon friends in times of adversity.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>+ 1992-1999: East Timor Action Network (ETAN) activists worked with members of Congress to restrict U.S. government support for the occupation, resulting in a decrease in military assistance, training and arms sales to Indonesia. Despite this, President Clinton authorized hundreds of millions of dollars in weapons sales and provided over US$500 million in economic aid.</p> \n\n<p>+ Early September 1999: Despite the killings and massive destruction by the Indonesian military and their militia which preceded and followed Timor&#8217;s vote for independence &#8211; the Clinton administration delayed ending military and economic support for Indonesia. U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, <a href=\"https://etan.org/estafeta/99/autumn/against.htm\" type=\"external\">Stapleton Roy</a>, told a journalist: &#8220;The dilemma is that Indonesia matters and East Timor doesn&#8217;t.&#8221; Finally, on September 10, in the face of strong public and Congressional pressure, President Clinton suspended all U.S. economic aid and military ties to Indonesia.</p> \n\n<p>The U.S. government has not yet responded to the basic recommendations presented in <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Chega</a>!, the report of Timor&#8217;s truth commission. The commission <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">called on</a> the U.S. and others to support an international tribunal to bring perpetrators of crimes committed during Indonesian illegal occupation to justice. The commission recommended reparations to the Timorese people from countries like the U.S. that backed Indonesia.</p> \n\n<p>Fidel Castro is now dead, and Donald Trump will be the next U.S. president.

The U.S., a far richer nation, gives relatively small amount in aid, largely focused on promoting private business and supporting militaries.</p> \n\n<p>As a U.S. citizen, I acknowledge this and redouble my commitment and solidarity as an individual, as an activist, and as a member of ETAN, to struggle to ensure genuine accountability and justice for crimes committed in Timor-Leste.
