More details soon.</p> \n\n<p>The company had planned on moving thousands of jobs to Mexico, to the chagrin of workers and labor groups. On Thanksgiving Day, Trump said via Twitter that he was &#8220;working hard&#8221; to &#8220;get Carrier A.C. company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana).&#8221; After days of negotiation with Carrier, he seems to have succeeded in keeping his campaign promise.</p> \n\n<p>I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A.C. Company to stay in the U.S. (Indiana). MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon!</p> \n\n<p>Manufacturing jobs have been increasingly exported to foreign countries, including China and Mexico over the last few decades. Hundreds of thousands of blue collar workers have been laid off as a result. American manufacturers say, however, that in order to stay competitive in the global economy they need to keep costs low. The most efficient way to do that is to hire cheap foreign labor. Carrier Corp was looking to follow this formula to keep profit margins in the green.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The jobs at Carrier Corp. are on the way to Mexico because the company concluded that it could not stay competitive and reward its shareholders unless it took advantage of lower production costs south of the border,&#8221; <a href=\"http://www.courant.com/business/hc-trump-carrier-20161128-story.html\" type=\"external\">reports</a> CNBC. &#8220;Things are as simple as that&#8230;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But Trump (or Mike Pence, who is still the governor of Indiana) managed to work his magic and convince Carrier&#8217;s parent company, UTC, to keep 1,000 jobs in Indiana where manufacturing jobs have been hemorrhaging for decades.</p> \n\n<p>Promising a combination of tax relief and regulation easing, Trump made an offer UTC couldn&#8217;t refuse. Left-wing economic populists like Bernie Sanders pushed Trump to make Carrier stay in the United States, suggesting that it was something the Trumpian right and labor left could agree on. Rather than incentivizing the conglomerate, Sanders and his allies were looking to use UTC&#8217;s multi-billionaire business relationship with the Pentagon as leverage. While Trump had promised to deploy similarly coercive tactics, such as high tariffs and penalties on companies that ship jobs abroad, he ultimately took a free market approach to the problem.</p> \n\n<p>During the presidential campaign, Trump called out Carrier by name and used the air conditioning company as an example of the worker unfriendly economic environment the United States has become.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;From the earliest days of his campaign, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/donald-trump?inline=nyt-per\" type=\"external\">Donald J. Trump</a> made keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States his signature economic issue, and the decision by Carrier, the big air-conditioner company, to move 2,000 of them from Indiana to Mexico was a tailor-made talking point for him on the stump,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/business/trump-to-announce-carrier-plant-will-keep-jobs-in-us.html?smid=tw-share\" type=\"external\">explains</a> The New York Times.</p> \n\n<p>Championing a populist economic message, Trump vowed to keep more jobs here in the United States. While technology will likely continue replacing manufacturing jobs at a much faster rate than foreign labor ever could, the billionaire businessman&#8217;s Carrier deal is a symbolic victory for the &#8220;America first&#8221; Trump movement.</p> \n\n<p>Without a doubt, it&#8217;s a good way to start a presidency. However, there&#8217;s only so much the federal government can do to alleviate the economic hardship of the Rust Belt, America&#8217;s manufacturing heartland. The steamboat of globalization and technological innovation cannot be tamed, let alone reversed. In short, there won&#8217;t be a manufacturing renaissance. That&#8217;s a pipe dream.</p> \n\n<p>Nonetheless, it looks like Trump came through this time around.</p> \n\n<p>Trump and future vice-president/current Indiana governor.

Some reunited decades later. Baptists re-main apart to this day.</p> \n\n<p>Likewise, in the last few years, a number of mainline Protestant congregations have parted with their denominations over homosexuality, although in far fewer numbers than during mid-19th century splits.</p> \n\n<p>But the exodus may not be over. For example, conservative Presbyterians and United Methodists have threatened to leave en masse if their denominations decides to allow gay clergy and same-sex marriages.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The parallels to the contemporary debate are fairly striking,&#8221; said Mark Valeri, a professor of church history at <a href=\"http://www.upsem.edu/\" type=\"external\">Union Presbyterian Seminary</a> in Richmond, Va.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;You have a long-simmering moral dispute that heats up an ecclesiastical and political question, which results in a division.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;And the question is, when the division creates branches, how courts adjudicate those disputes.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But there are key differences between the disputes over slavery and homosexuality, some historians say.</p> \n\n<p>For instance, many conservatives say that it is not simply the gay issue that is driving them out the door, but a long liberal trend in mainline denominations that stretches back 30 years or more.</p> \n\n<p>Second, Scripture shows only a grudging tolerance of slavery, a far cry from its ringing endorsement of heterosexual unions, argues <a href=\"http://www.robgagnon.net/\" type=\"external\">Robert Gagnon</a>, an associate professor of New Testament at Pittsburgh Theological Seminary.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;What kind of legitimate analogy can be made between the two?

She and her colleagues hoped that the school garden would change that.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We wanted to create better habits with this project,&#8221; Martins says. &#8220;We wanted them to improve their eating and become healthier.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>That idea is behind flourishing school gardens across Brazil. The program started 12 years ago as a pilot program in five schools, as part of a project by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Program. Today, there are a few thousand school gardens in 700 cities and towns. Many are run independently by schools. Others are supported by city governments.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to know yet whether school gardens have improved children&#8217;s health, says Albaneide Peixinho, who ran Brazil&#8217;s school meal program for 13 years. But she says schools are reporting that the gardens have made students more aware of their food.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;With school gardens, they see that food comes from the Earth,&#8221; Peixinho says, and they are eating healthier. Some studies even show that the students are influencing how their families eat. &#8220;Parents say that the kids are eating a lot of fruits and vegetables, and they insist on eating those foods at home.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Sarah Campos (left) and Juliana Santos, former students of&amp;#160;the Le&#227;o Machado School.

But she tried some when she and her classmates cooked radishes they had grown in the school garden.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I loved it so much that I even had a second plate,&#8221; Campos says. Now, she says she eats radishes often. &#8220;I ask my mom to make them for lunch sometimes. She puts them in the salad with carrots, and with potatoes. It&#8217;s very good.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>She and her classmates say they are more open to eating vegetables now.

It also would establish uniform rules on corporations&#8217; intellectual property, open the Internet even in communist Vietnam and crack down on wildlife trafficking and environmental abuses.</p> \n\n<p>Its full 30-chapter text will not be available for perhaps a month, but labor unions, environmentalists and liberal activists are poised to argue that the agreement favors big business over workers and environmental protection.

For most Americans, even many on the left, the true severity of this rant went unnoticed.</p> \n\n<p>You see, when someone in Trump&#8217;s position does something like this, as opposed to a private citizen or even presidential candidate, there are a whole mess of legal issues that become involved.</p> \n\n<p>For starters, a&amp;#160;president doesn&#8217;t have the power to single-handedly order a wiretap. Meaning that, if Trump or anyone associated with him were&amp;#160;monitored, a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA court)&amp;#160;would have had to grant&amp;#160;a warrant to do so. And the only way the FISA court would have done that is if they found probable cause.</p> \n\n<p>In case you didn&#8217;t know, the FISA court was authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to oversee requests for surveillance of spies inside the United States by U.S. intelligence agencies. The Chief Judge&amp;#160;appointed to oversee the court is Rosemary Collyer, a United States District Court judge who was appointed by George W. Bush. She was then given her position on the FISA court by Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts &#8212; who was also&amp;#160;picked by Bush and heavily supported by the Republican party.</p> \n\n<p>So, right off the bat Trump&#8217;s claim, if true, would indicate that the evidence surrounding <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">these Russian allegations</a> was sound enough that the FISA court found probable cause to approve the surveillance.</p> \n\n<p>In other words, if we&#8217;re to take Trump at his word, it&#8217;s not&amp;#160;Obama&amp;#160;who &#8220;bugged Trump Tower,&#8221; it was U.S. intelligence officials presenting evidence to the FISA court which then approved the monitoring of communication within that building over suspicion that Trump, or members of his campaign, engaged in possible <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">treasonous contact with Russian officials</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Most people have concluded that Trump&#8217;s tantrum was triggered by a Breitbart article &#8212; which was based off comments made by right-wing conspiracy theorist Mark Levin &#8212; claiming there&#8217;s a &#8220;police state&#8221; being secretly run by Obama to create some sort of &#8220;coup.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Again, any wiretapping of Trump Tower would have been granted by the FISA court amid&amp;#160;overwhelming&amp;#160;evidence of Russian links to Trump or his associates. If Trump wants to continue to claim this is true, then he&#8217;s either accusing Barack Obama of a blatant crime that&amp;#160;should be investigated immediately, or he&#8217;s admitting that the FISA court found enough evidence of Russian ties to approve these supposed wiretaps.</p> \n\n<p>So it&#8217;s either one or the other. Either Trump is:</p> \n\n<p>Well, then there&#8217;s always the possibility&amp;#160;that, because <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">he&#8217;s an unhinged moron</a>, he simply read this article in Breitbart, threw&amp;#160;another ridiculous hissy fit on Twitter, and he has absolutely no damn idea what he&#8217;s talking about. Hell, he compared this to Watergate, proving that he doesn&#8217;t even understand what the Nixon-era scandal was about.</p> \n\n<p>But the kicker to this is, Trump&#8217;s incompetence has opened the door for a public reveal of the details surrounding why, if true, the FISA court approved any requests to monitor anything related to him or his associates. After all, even if you&amp;#160;think Trump&#8217;s mentally unstable, he was clearly serious when he made these comments. Considering the office he currently occupies, his words should then immediately require an independent investigation &#8212; which means subpoenas &#8212; that would ultimately bring practically anything and everything related to this into public light.</p> \n\n<p>Because he has no idea what he&#8217;s doing, Trump has screwed himself over in several ways. If you take him at his word, and this is like &#8220;Watergate,&#8221; then he&#8217;s going to have to order extensive independent investigations, along with Congress being involved, into what he claims was a blatant and extremely illegal order by a Barack Obama to have Trump Tower put under surveillance.</p> \n\n<p>However, if he doesn&#8217;t do that, then he&#8217;s essentially admitting this whole rant was nothing more than pure ignorance, based on his trusting of a fringe, right-wing conspiracy site, and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">he&#8217;s too incompetent</a> to hold the position he currently occupies.</p> \n\n<p>That or he&#8217;s aware of the FISA court granting these warrants, he thinks they were illegal and not justified, so he should order all the information contained within them to be made public to &#8220;clear his name.&#8221; And if any FISA warrants related to investigations into him or his associates do exist, but he doesn&#8217;t want to make any of that information public, then he&#8217;s more or less admitting that they were credible and he doesn&#8217;t want people to know about the information that was used that led to their approval.</p> \n\n<p>The bottom line is, Donald Trump&#8217;s stupidity has basically led to one of four main possibilities:</p> \n\n<p>That&amp;#160;means the only positive outcome for Trump and Republicans is the extremely unlikely possibility that his accusations against Barack Obama are right. Otherwise, nothing good is going to&amp;#160;come of this for Trump or the Republican party.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>21 Facebook comments</p>", "title": "Trump\u2019s Desperate Attempt to Distract Americans From His Scandals Backfires \u2018Bigly\u2019", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://forwardprogressives.com/trumps-desperate-attempt-distract-americans-scandals-backfires-bigly/", "published_at": "2017-03-04", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>New clashes erupted Thursday between Venezuelan riot police and President Nicolas Maduro's opponents, inflaming the tension after a day of deadly unrest in the beleaguered oil-rich nation.</p> \n\n<p>Police backed by armored trucks fired tear gas to break up a large march as it reached a vital freeway in Caracas, then edged back slightly as masked protesters pelted them with stones.</p> \n\n<p>Demonstrators vowed not to flinch in their campaign to oust Maduro, despite three weeks of protest violence that has left eight people dead, including three on Wednesday.</p> \n\n<p>\"Sure we're tired, but we've got to stand strong.

He has recently inserted himself into litigation in which 9/11 victims allege that the Saudi government funded Islamist charities that provided financial and logistical support to al-Qaida.</p> \n\n<p>Moussaoui&#8217;s account of being a liaison between Osama bin Laden and members of the Saudi royal family was told to Philadelphia lawyer Sean Carter over the course of two days of questioning in October at the federal supermax prison in Florence, Colo., and has only now been cleared for public release by the U.S. government.</p> \n\n<p>Carter has been defending against a Saudi motion to dismiss his case, facing the unenviable burden of producing evidence of a Saudi link to al-Qaida without the benefit of taking discovery. Moussaoui&#8217;s testimony was unforeseen. The man who once took flight lessons in Oklahoma and Minnesota in preparation for a terror strike contacted the federal judge presiding over the case and offered to provide information.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>According to Carter, much of what Moussaoui told him was new information about his role with al-Qaida, not even revealed during his own trial.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;He testified that he had this role in creating a digital database of al-Qaida&#8217;s donors and he says that he personally entered the names of a number of senior Saudi officials and members of the royal family,&#8221; Carter said.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;He explained to us that it was his understanding that they were making donations to bin Laden in order to maintain their legitimacy in the eyes of the Saudi Ulema, who are the Wahhabi religious clerics,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;The Saudi state itself is the product of a pact between the House of Saud and the Wahhabi Ulema and the continuing legitimacy of that government resides very much on maintaining that bargain.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Inside the walls of supermax, Moussaoui first took an oath to Allah &#8211; &#8220;May Allah curse the liar&#8221; &#8211; before providing Carter with sworn testimony. He claimed that Sheikh Sa&#8217;id, the chief financial officer of al-Qaida, asked him to track Saudi contributions to the jihad effort, a request that came from bin Laden.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Sheikh Osama wanted to keep a record who give money &#8230; who is to be listened to or who continue to &#8211; to the jihad,&#8221; Moussaoui told Carter.</p> \n\n<p>Moussaoui named many members of the Saudi royal family as having been supportive, a funding source he described as &#8220;crucial.&#8221; He also claimed to have served as a courier for written communications between bin Laden and the House of Saud.</p> \n\n<p>The Saudis vehemently deny Moussaoui&#8217;s assertions, claiming that he is mentally imbalanced and that the 9/11 Commission was dismissive of such claims. That report &#8220;found no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded al-Qaida.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Not so fast, say two 9/11 Commission members &#8211; former Navy Secretary John Lehman and former Sen. Bob Kerrey. Both say the 9/11 Commission did not exonerate Saudi Arabia.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>And, former Sen. Bob Graham, past chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, told me he is convinced there was a connection between some of the 9/11 terrorists and Saudi Arabia. Graham co-chaired the congressional inquiry into intelligence activities before and after the attacks, whose report included the classified 28 pages. He believes that a Saudi government agent named Omar al-Bayoumi provided assistance to 9/11 hijackers Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t give details because they are classified, Michael, but you correctly state they primarily deal with who financed 9/11 and they point a strong finger at Saudi Arabia,&#8221; Graham said. He maintains that the 9/11 Commission did not &#8220;pursue some of the leads that we had left them with.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>What might resolve the discrepancy is the release of 28 pages.</p> \n\n<p>According to Carter, that matter rests with the director of national intelligence for an interagency declassification review, &#8220;whatever that is.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We think the 28 pages are really the tip of the iceberg,&#8221; he added.</p> \n\n<p>So why would Moussaoui want to help 9/11 plaintiffs?</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I think the reality is he&#8217;s sitting in prison for the rest of his life and the Saudi royals are not, and I think he has a desire to demonstrate and clear the record about everyone who was involved,&#8221; Carter said.</p> \n\n<p>Two weeks ago, I asked White House chief of staff Denis McDonough whether the passing of Saudi King Abdullah would support the release of the 28 pages?</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to get involved in the 28 pages now, Michael, any more than I did before,&#8221; McDonough said.</p> \n\n<p>Moussaoui&#8217;s testimony makes that position even less sustainable.

Because according to a recent report from The Wall Street Journal, the company&#8217;s TV set won&#8217;t be launching any time soon &#8212; if it even launches at all.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://bgr.com/2012/12/12/apple-tv-next-big-thing/\" type=\"external\">See more tech stories on the FOX Business Technology homepage. Opens a New Window.</a></p> \n\n<p>In a research note sent to clients on Tuesday evening, Reitzes ponders what might snap investors out of their &#8220;recent funk.&#8221; Shares of Apple stock plummeted by as much as 25% in November from a high of $705.07, which was hit just before the iPhone 5 launched this past September. While some say &#8220;people overbelieved in Apple&#8221; and the end is nigh, Reitzes thinks Apple just needs to launch the &#8220;next big thing&#8221; to remind investors why it is the most successful consumer electronics company in the world.</p> \n\n<p>Reitzes goes on to say that an Apple HDTV might be just what the doctor ordered and that a set-top box and service combination could do the trick as well. He sees Apple unveiling its big plans for the living room some time in 2013, and he says he believes Apple is &#8220;exploring a new service that integrates iOS, iCloud, iTunes and more content that would bring customers a new experience around a TV-like device.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The analyst continued, &#8220;We believe that the Apple version of TV may evolve into a product that is &#8216;always on&#8217; with the ability to display a variety of messages (texts, Facebook postings, Tweets, email, etc.), weather, pictures, news and other key information as well as even act as a video conferencing device [...] any Apple solution seems like it will need to work along side traditional cable and media arrangements. However, we see opportunity in Apple being able to perhaps work out deals with providers to gain access to channel guides and other key information in order to provide a more elegant integration experience.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>MORE FROM BGR:</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p>", "title": "Where is Apple\u2019s \u2018Next Big Thing\u2019?", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2012/12/12/where-is-apples-next-big-thing.html", "published_at": "2016-01-29", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>Currently there is a bit of a &#8220;civil war&#8221; going on among progressives between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders supporters. During a primary season, that&#8217;s to be expected. Undoubtedly, it&#8217;s at this point during an election year when voters are most emotionally tied to a particular candidate. Primary elections often resemble sporting events more than political contests.</p> \n\n<p>But what&#8217;s alarmed me most about this particular primary season&amp;#160;is the number of people threatening to &#8220;sit out&#8221; or &#8220;write-in&#8221; a candidate if their particular candidate doesn&#8217;t happen to win the nomination. A belief that I think is one of the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">most asinine stances I&#8217;ve ever heard</a>. If you think either Donald Trump, Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio would be better (or just as bad) as voting for either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, you are out of your damn mind.</p> \n\n<p>I don&#8217;t care what your thoughts are of either Clinton or Sanders, on their worst day, either candidate is a million times better than anyone from the Republican party. And with the rights for millions of Americans at risk, as well as the Supreme Court and our progress on climate change, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">there&#8217;s too much at stake this election</a> to have any group of people not support the eventual Democratic nominee.</p> \n\n<p>And while I have encountered a few Clinton supporters who&#8217;ve vowed not to support Sanders if he becomes the nominee (I&#8217;ve even been blocked by a few of them for calling them idiots), the &#8220;my candidate or no one&#8221; crowd <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">is mostly found among Sanders supporters</a>. Though I will gladly admit that the majority of those supporting Sanders do&amp;#160;understand the bigger picture and have said they plan to support whichever candidate ultimately wins the nomination.</p> \n\n<p>To those people, I can&#8217;t thank them enough. In fact, I can&#8217;t thank anyone enough for realizing what&#8217;s on the line this election and why it&#8217;s so crucial that we all get out and &#8220;vote blue, no matter who.&#8221; I don&#8217;t even want to think about how much damage Republicans will be able to do to this nation if we hand them the White House this November. <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">It will make George W. Bush&#8217;s eight years</a> seem like a wonderful dream compared to the nightmare that a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz would inflict upon the country.</p> \n\n<p>But there&#8217;s an irony to anyone who says that they&#8217;re going to take their ball and go home if their candidate doesn&#8217;t win, and it&#8217;s this:&amp;#160;Neither candidate can win without help from the supporters of their primary rival.</p> \n\n<p>If Hillary Clinton wins the nomination, then half of all Sanders supporters decide not to support her, she likely&amp;#160;loses and we&#8217;re stuck with a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz.</p> \n\n<p>But guess what?</p> \n\n<p>If Bernie Sanders wins the nomination, then half of all Clinton supporters decide not to support him, he&#8217;s likely&amp;#160;going to lose and we&#8217;re going to be stuck with a President Trump/Rubio/Cruz.</p> \n\n<p>The truth of the matter is, whether each side wants to admit it or not, they both need each other this&amp;#160;November. Because come election day, if one group decides to let selfish ego and pride get in the way by not supporting the Democratic nominee, guess what?</p> \n\n<p>We all lose.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>So, no matter what Clinton or Sanders supporters might think of one another, the reality is, they&#8217;re in this together &#8211; whether they like it or not.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">I Asked Liberals to Unite to Protect the Rights of Millions, Here are Some of the Responses</a></p> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Ultra Pro-Bernie Backer Robert Reich Feels the Wrath of Sanders Supporters for Preaching Unity</a></p> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">For the Last Time: Here's Proof the Democratic Primary Wasn't Rigged Against Bernie Sanders</a></p> \n\n<p>0 Facebook comments</p>", "title": "Supporters of Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders Need to Acknowledge This Crucial Fact", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://forwardprogressives.com/supporters-both-hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-need-acknowledge-crucial-fact/", "published_at": "2016-02-27", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, rape&#8212;on college campuses or anywhere else&#8212;is a very serious crime that should be punished severely.

But a law co-authored by L.A. state Sen. Kevin de Leon would have state-run college campuses establish an &#8220;affirmative consent&#8221; standard for its students.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>According to the language of the bill, SB 967, students who want to have sex must essentially establish that there has been &#8220;an affirmative, unambiguous, and conscious decision by each participant to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity.&#8221;&#8230;No more making sexy faces and sounds for you. You&#8217;ve got to verbalize. Or get it on paper.</p> \n\n<p>Why not just require a notarized letter from an attorney, or better yet, a license? If we&#8217;re going to go this far, maybe college kids who want to have sex should go to a DMV-like office to get permission.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>All joking aside, the fact that this is even an issue suggests that a lot of college kids are having sex they&#8217;re not comfortable with having. People don&#8217;t sign a waiver when they&#8217;re engaging in any activity with someone they know and trust. (My advice to college kids: if you feel like you need to have a written contract drawn up with your &#8220;partner,&#8221; you shouldn&#8217;t be having sex with them.)&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/01/college-sexual-assault_n_5247267.html\" type=\"external\">Some of the colleges under investigation right now for mishandling sexual assault cases</a> are the most liberal, anything-goes, sexually open institutions in America. They host extravagant &#8220;Sex Week&#8221; events and pass out condoms to freshmen. They talk a lot about &#8220;consent,&#8221; but very little about respect, caring, or good judgment. Plying a &#8220;yes&#8221; out of someone is all that matters.</p> \n\n<p>In an environment like this, the boundaries of consent begin to break down. Students&#8212;who face enormous peer pressure to participate in this free-for-all&#8212;have trouble saying &#8220;no&#8221; when they want to. Other students simply don&#8217;t respect a &#8220;no.&#8221; Add a huge amount of alcohol into the mix, and chaos ensues.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>This is the problem that college administrators and lawmakers are trying to fix. But until they have the guts to criticize the culture on college campuses, they&#8217;ll get nowhere.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "California Bill Demands \u201cVerbal or Written Consent\u201d for Sex on College Campuses", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://thepoliticalinsider.com/california-bill-demands-verbal-written-consent-sex-college-campuses/", "published_at": "2014-06-11", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Peter LaBarbera</a> is claiming that gays, or, as he calls them, &#8220;homosexual activists,&#8221; are are &#8220;doing to Christians&#8221; what the &#8220;Nazis used to do to the Jews.&#8221; LaBarbera, head of the <a href=\"http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/anti-gay/active_hate_groups\" type=\"external\">certified anti-gay hate group</a>, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Americans For Truth About Homosexuality</a>(AFTAH), was speaking with <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Judith Reisman</a>, of Jerry Falwell&#8217;s&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Liberty University</a>. <a href=\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/labarbera-homosexual-activists-doing-to-christians-what-nazis-used-used-to-do-to-jews\" type=\"external\">Right Wing Watch</a>, which has the audio of this conversation, calls Reisman &#8220;Liberty University&#8217;s&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/story/20744/her_kinsey_obsession\" type=\"external\">resident junk scientist</a>.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Homosexual activists in many ways drive our culture, they decide what&#8217;s going to be in a movie, we see all the portrayals, homosexuals are the most positively portrayed in the movies and on TV, Christians are often negatively portrayed and stereotyped,&#8221; LaBarbera claims in his conversation with Reisman. &#8220;In many ways, in fact Judith you are Jewish, I think you&#8217;re starting to see Hollywood what they&#8217;re doing to Christians and to people of faith who actually adhere to traditional values, they&#8217;re demonizing them like the Nazis used to do to the Jews.

The rest is history.</p> \n\n<p>As the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom approaches, the spirit of protest seems to be rekindling in many parts of the country. The Dream Defenders remain camped out in the Florida capitol, demanding justice for Trayvon Martin and an end to racial profiling; North Carolina's <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Moral Monday protesters</a> have rallied and committed civil disobedience each week, defying the far-right agenda of their state legislators. In New York, the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">coalition against stop and frisk</a> won its victory in court, but it took organizing, rallying, and yes, marching, to make it happen.</p> \n\n<p>It's a good time, then, for a new memoir by congressman and 1960s civil rights leader John Lewis. In March: Book One, out today from <a href=\"http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/march/760\" type=\"external\">Top Shelf Productions</a>, Lewis' history and the highs and lows of the civil rights movement are brought to life&#8212;vividly, as the memoir is in comic format.</p> \n\n<p>The first of three books follows a young Lewis from his family's farm in Alabama to college and to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), to lunch counter sit-ins, jail cells and a showdown with the mayor of Nashville. Co-written by Andrew Aydin, a staffer who's been with Lewis for years, and drawn by award-winning comics artist Nate Powell, the book makes history feel real and present in a way that few accounts of civil rights legends have managed to.</p> \n\n<p>Lewis and Aydin sat down with me during a visit to New York to discuss the new comic, their goal of inspiring and instructing a new generation, and where they're finding hope these days.</p> \n\n<p>Sarah Jaffe: This book is the first of three volumes, all with the title March. Why did you pick that title?</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: March is the spring, it's life, it's the beginning. So much happened in March. But it's also moving feet.</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: There was a quote that stuck with us very early on, it was something Dr. King said: &#8220;There's no sound more powerful than the marching feet of the determined people.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But March is so many different things. It is the need to march. It is March 7, 1965. There's so much meaning behind it, it seemed almost self-evident.</p> \n\n<p>Book 2 contains a very famous march. During the movement, the Congressman was so committed to action. There were so many moments where people wanted to talk, and he wanted to do. There's this scene in Book 2, when they're saying the violence is getting to be too much, we have to work out a solution, and they'd turn to John Lewis and say, &#8220;What do you think we should do?&#8221; And he would say, &#8220;We should just march.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>They would ask him again and he would say, &#8220;We should just march.&#8221; Finally they say, &#8220;John, everything you're saying is that we should march, but people are going to get hurt, people are going to get killed, it's your own foolish pride that's getting involved with that, you're just nothing but a sinner.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>And he's like, &#8220;I may be a sinner, but we're gonna march.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It so typifies his view on how to get things done. We can sit around and talk about it, we can make speeches, but really when it comes down to it, the hard part is doing the work. Taking action.</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: This may sound a little self-serving here, but my own organization, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, objected to the march in Selma. We had an all-night discussion, a debate whether we should march. It's clear to me that I should march. And I said, &#8220;I've been to Selma many many times, I've stood in line at the courthouse, I've been arrested, I've been to jail there. The local people want to march, and I'm going to march.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>So I jumped in the car with two of the young people, and I drove to Selma, late at night, got there at three or four in the morning, got our sleeping bags out, got up the next morning, got dressed, went to the church, and we lined up and we marched. The rest is history.</p> \n\n<p>Sometimes you just have to do what your spirit says do. Go for it.</p> \n\n<p>Why did you decide to do this as a comic?&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: I was working for the Congressman on the 2008 campaign as his press secretary, and we started talking about what we were going to do after we had our nights and weekends back. I admitted I was going to a comic book convention&#8212;in politics that gets you laughs, snickers, a little jeering. But the Congressman said, &#8220;You know, there was a comic book during the movement and it was incredibly influential.&#8221; That comic book was &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.ep.tc/mlk/\" type=\"external\">Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story</a>.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>I went home that night, Googled it, and read the story about how it <a href=\"http://theubs.com/features/themontstory.php\" type=\"external\">inspired the Greensboro 4</a>. I came back the next day and asked him &#8220;Why don't you write a comic book?&#8221;&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>The Congressman looked at me like I was crazy there for a second, but we talked about the comic from the '50s, and a couple weeks later I asked again, and the Congressman said, &#8220;OK, but only if you write it with me.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It just seemed to make sense, the idea of a comic book inspiring young people to get involved and also teaching them the tactics.</p> \n\n<p>The book uses President Obama's inauguration as a framing device. Can you talk about the decision to do that?</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: People ask me from time to time whether the election of Barack Obama was the fulfillment of Martin Luther King's dream, and I say, &#8220;No, it's just a down payment.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Because we're not there. More and more, people are saying that we still have a distance to travel, and that we cannot be at peace or be at home with ourselves in America until we create a truly multiracial democratic society, where no one is left behind, and it doesn't matter whether you're black or white, Latino or Asian-American or Native America, whether you're straight or gay. . And there's a way to do it. If you want to change things, you got to find a way to make some noise. You cannot be quiet.</p> \n\n<p>The lessons of March say, This is the way another generation did it, and you, too, can follow that path, studying the way of peace, love and nonviolence, and finding a way to get in the way. Finding a way to get in trouble&#8212;good trouble, necessary trouble.</p> \n\n<p>The book relates some of the experiences you had as a young person that led you to civil rights activism. Most people probably wouldn't think of raising chickens as a thing that would shape a civil rights leader.</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: It may sound sort of silly, sort of strange, but I wouldn't be the person I am today if it was not for those chickens.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>It was my calling to take care of these innocent little creatures. I'm convinced those chickens that I preached to in the '40s and the '50s tended to listen to me much better than some of my colleagues listen to me today in the Congress. Really! Most of those chickens were a little more productive. At least they produce eggs.</p> \n\n<p>They taught me discipline, they taught me patience, they taught me hard work and stick-to-it-ness.</p> \n\n<p>You talk about Emmett Till's death as a pivotal moment for you, and it seems like Trayvon Martin's death has been a touchstone for a new generation of activists. Yet both of their deaths came at a time when violence against young black men was not rare. Why do you think each case hit a nerve?</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: I think there are certain periods in our history&#8212;just a spark. &amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>I was 15 years old, working out in the field when I heard what happened. I kept thinking that it could happen to me, but especially to some of my cousins who lived in Buffalo, New York, who would come South in the summer to spend time with us.</p> \n\n<p>A few months later, when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat, one thing she said in later years was, &#8220;It's not just my feet that were tired, but also, I thought about Emmett Till.&#8221; I remember that very, very well.</p> \n\n<p>One of the things that the comic format does so well for this story is capture the violence and brutality that practitioners of nonviolence went through, both in preparation for and during actions. I particularly loved the sequence where one person quit training, saying it was too hard. Talk about the process of getting those moments on paper.</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: We provided the words, but [the artist] Nate Powell&#8212;I love his capacity to capture the drama, to bring it to life, to make it real. You can see it; you can feel it. Even though I lived through it, to see it there makes the words sing.</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: This is very much centered around stories that I've heard the Congressman tell to all these people over the years. Nate lifted that off the paper and made it something at a whole other level. He's very good at finding a natural flow for your eye.</p> \n\n<p>We tried make sure that it wasn't just accurate for the sake of telling the story, but accurate for the sake of instructing, so that people who have never been to a nonviolent workshop could read and understand what one was. Nate really captured that.</p> \n\n<p>Another thing I think the book did well was capture the real work that went on behind the scenes. We're so rarely shown how many years of preparation and organizing went into making movements happen. I'd love to hear about the challenges of showing that part of the story.</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: The planning, the training, the nitty-gritty organizing&#8212;you may wait for days or weeks or even months before you see something. But you do it. You're consistent and you're persistent, day in and day out.</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: You see how this work ethic has just been such an omnipresent force in the Congressman&#8217;s life since he was 17, 18 years old&#8212;or even before that, on the farm. I remember at several points asking &#8220;What time did that take place?&#8221; and he'd be like &#8220;Oh, 5:00, 6:00 a.m.&#8221; And you realize these are college kids. How many college kids today get up at 5:00 in the morning, much less to go to an organizing meeting before class?</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: On April the 19, 1960, the attorney for the Nashville movement who had defended the students, his home was bombed around 6:00 a.m. And by 6:30 or 6:45 we were in a meeting. Students came from all over the city and we made a decision&#8212;it was a consensus&#8212;that we would have a march from the heart of the student community down to city hall. We sent the mayor of the city a telegram to meet us at high noon. There were more than 4,000 students saying, &#8220;Mr. Mayor, do you favor desegregation of the lunch counters?&#8221; And the next day, the banner headline in the local paper read that the Mayor said Yes to the integration of the lunch counters.</p> \n\n<p>It was that sense that we had to act, we had to do something, we couldn't wait.</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: You always say, &#8220;You gotta get up! You can't sleep through the revolution!&#8221;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>The anniversary of the March on Washington is approaching quickly, and it's never seemed more relevant in my lifetime. We're seeing renewed attacks on civil rights and voting rights, along with a renewed movement for racial and economic justice. How are you feeling about the present day?</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: In spite of all the problems and difficulties, all the apparent setbacks, delays, I feel very hopeful, very optimistic. I think we are in the process of building a very powerful movement.</p> \n\n<p>North Carolina's governor just yesterday signed into law one of the most unbelievable pieces of legislation that would lead to a systematic, deliberate effort to suppress the votes of minorities, young people and the elderly. But in spite of that, I'm hopeful that we're going to continue to push, and it's going to start the fire for a real movement. Look at what's happening in North Carolina now, the Moral Mondays. It's a good sign. It'll spread around, not just the South, but around America.</p> \n\n<p>What do you hope that some of those young people involved in North Carolina, camping out in the capitol in Florida, what do you hope that they take away from this comic?</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: It's my hope that many of the young people will have an opportunity to read March and be inspired, and see another generation got out there and did what they could, and that we too must pick up and push the ball further down the road.</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: Some people have started getting advance copies, and one of them gave the book to his 9-year-old son.</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: It's a white man, right?</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: Yes. His kid read the book, enjoyed it, had a little trouble with Emmett Till's death, but it resonated with him, and so now he's put on a suit and is marching around his house demanding equality.</p> \n\n<p>What does that say about what we have to look forward to?</p> \n\n<p>John Lewis: They shall lead the way. Like the children in Birmingham and Selma, Albany, Georgia and other parts. They led the way.</p> \n\n<p>Andrew Aydin: That's part of the bigger message that I think we'll really be able to get into after this book. Because the tactics that worked in Birmingham didn't necessarily work in Albany, and they had to change. Tactics in one city didn't work for every foe or every objective. From that original idea of the Montgomery bus boycott being useful as an example of successful nonviolent direct action, the whole premise is showing more and more examples of different tactics used to express different forms of opposition. As activists today look for new tactics to address their own opposition, they have inspiration and they see concrete examples of how things were reimagined but still stuck to the basic tenets, the philosophy and discipline of nonviolence.</p> \n\n<p>Panels from March: Book One courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.topshelfcomix.com/catalog/march/760\" type=\"external\">Top Shelf Productions</a>.

Instead Donald Trump went up to Pennsylvania to deliver a campaign speech on behalf of Rick Saccone, who is at risk of losing to Democrat Conner Lamb next Tuesday in a district that Trump won by twenty points. The rally was reminiscent of Trump&#8217;s aimless campaign speeches in 2016 where he pontificated like a mad evangelist for an hour or more.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NewsCorpse/posts/2069608633053921\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>In keeping with his practice of shrieking sermonizing, Trump made a point of attacking what he considers the the scourge of his existence: the media (video below). He rattled off the sort of derogatory slander that would ordinarily be reserved for bitter enemies of all that is righteous. It was a storm of damnation, both personal and broadly general.</p> \n\n<p>For instance, Trump lashed out at NBC&#8217;s Meet the Press calling it &#8220;A show now headed by sleepy eyes Chuck Todd. He&#8217;s a sleeping son of a bitch, I&#8217;ll tell ya.&#8221; Remember, this speech was at a daytime rally with children present. He also went after an unnamed &#8220;certain anchor on CNN&#8221; who he said was &#8220;fake as hell, CNN. The worst. So fake. Fake news.&#8221; And he wasn&#8217;t letting NBC off either. He ranted that they were &#8220;perhaps worse than CNN, I have to tell you. And MSNBC is horrible.&#8221; Continuing down that path of raw animosity he called MSNBC &#8220;third rate. And NBC, which is horrible. Their newscast, by the way is not doing well. On NBC network. They&#8217;re heading down the tubes.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>This might be a good time to inject some facts into the discussion. NBC&#8217;s newscast anchored by Lester Holt has <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/evening-news-ratings-week-of-dec-25-q4-2017/353818\" type=\"external\">won ten consecutive quarters</a> in the key advertising demographic of 25-54 year olds. They were also <a href=\"http://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/in-february-world-news-tonight-wins-the-evenings-while-today-takes-mornings/358741\" type=\"external\">number one</a> in the most recent sweeps period of February 2018. And their morning news program, the Today Show, topped their competition (ABC&#8217;s Good Morning America and CBS This Morning) in both the demo and total viewers. As for MSNBC, Rachel Maddow has been <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">beating Trump&#8217;s BFF</a> Sean Hannity on a regular basis.</p> \n\n<p>But Trump wasn&#8217;t about to let mere reality interfere with his delusions. He went on to make a ludicrous and utterly nonsensical prediction about the media that he despises so, and which he is convinced hates him. Pointing to the press at the rally he said&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Six months prior to the election, every one of those guys &#8211; &#8216;We really endorse Donald Trump. We think he has to win.&#8217; You know why? Because if I don&#8217;t win the election their ratings are gonna go so far down they&#8217;re gonna be out of business, every one of them.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>WTF is he trying to say here? That the media that he accuses of trying to destroy him will suddenly reason that it&#8217;s in their interest to support him? If that&#8217;s true, then why wouldn&#8217;t they support him now for the same reasons? What&#8217;s more, he&#8217;s implying that the media&#8217;s surging ratings are the result of having him around to attack. Which means that more viewers are watching because they enjoy seeing him get hammered. That&#8217;s actually true. Every poll shows that Trump has the lowest approval rating of any president ever recorded. So people probably are happy to see him get cut down by responsible journalists whose reporting of Trump&#8217;s failures is just part their job.</p> \n\n<p>The tone that Trump sets in these rallies is decidedly hostile and un-American. He praises China&#8217;s Xi Jinping, who just maneuvered himself into being president for life (of which <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Trump is envious</a>). He declares that he blindly trusts Kim Jong Un&#8217;s promise to refrain from missile and nuclear testing. He protects Vladimir Putin&#8217;s Russia from sanctions mandated by Congress as punishment for their election tampering. Trump speaks of these and other anti-democratic tyrants in radiantly glowing terms. But he viciously insults fellow Americans who practice their Constitutionally protected right to freedom of the press. And he thinks that&#8217;s how to MAGA &#8211; or KAG, as he now says (Keep America Gross).</p> \n\n<p>How Fox News Deceives and Controls Their Flock: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QSSMOES/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B00QSSMOES&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=newscorpsecom-20&amp;amp;linkId=TLI6JC2OYE22MUTS\" type=\"external\">Fox Nation vs. Reality: The Fox News Cult of Ignorance.</a> Available now at Amazon.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "In Unhinged Speech Trump Slobbers Over Foreign Despots While Attacking America\u2019s Free Press", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://newscorpse.com/ncWP/?p%3D31230", "published_at": "", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Santa Fe Police spokeswoman Celina Westervelt said that at about 6 p.m. a man and a woman entered the Herrera Drive Walmart.

Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich to transition the Valles Caldera National Preserve to the National Park Service cleared the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Tuesday with bipartisan support, according to a news release from the senators.</p> \n\n<p>The bill would transfer management of the preserve from the current board of trustees to the Park Service under a preserve model. Hunting and fishing would be mandated under the legislation.</p> \n\n<p>In the news release, Udall said, &#8220;The legislation that was approved by committee today respects and preserves the longstanding educational, grazing, and exceptional hunting and fishing opportunities that are cherished and valued by so many New Mexicans. National Park Service management will ensure steadier funding &#8230; so the Valles Caldera will continue to prosper as a natural wonder that all can enjoy.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;By shifting to Park Service management, we can open the caldera to the public while conserving the one-of-a-kind resources found there,&#8221; said Heinrich.

One has to question whether the cartoonist is making a less than casual reference to this when in the cartoon they have police saying after shooting a chimpanzee that &#8220;Now they will have to find someone else to write the stimulus bill.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Being that the stimulus bill has been the first legislative victory of President Barack Obama (the first African American president) and has become synonymous with him it is not a reach to wonder are they inferring that a monkey wrote the last bill?</p> \n\n<p>Well actually, yes, it is a reach. That&#8217;s why the New York Post refuses to apologize and issued this <a href=\"http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/race/2009/02/outraged-readers-complain-about-chimp-cartoon-.html\" type=\"external\">statement</a>:</p> \n\n<p>The cartoon is a clear parody of a current news event, to wit the shooting of a violent chimpanzee in Connecticut. It broadly mocks Washington&#8217;s efforts to revive the economy. Again, Al Sharpton reveals himself as nothing more than a publicity opportunist.</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;ll leave Sharpton&#8217;s motivation alone, but this whole thing seems a little puzzling. Consider three recent events.</p> \n\n<p>Guess which one of these is irrelevant to the cartoon? If you picked&amp;#160; #1, you&#8217;re right. This cartoon has nothing to do with the ethnicity of Obama&#8217;s father and everything to do with the fact that the stimulus bill is messy. So messy, in fact, that it could have been written by a chimpanzee.</p> \n\n<p>The truth is, it&#8217;s not a good cartoon. Because it is an awkward attempt to combine two unrelated news stories, it doesn&#8217;t resonate, not in the way that <a href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_q0ioDxOSoAA/Rwuul_0jFnI/AAAAAAAAABA/f1eVEc3HV2A/s200/nycover3.jpg\" type=\"external\">this</a> really wonderful cartoon does. You many not even get the cartoon at all (stimulus=monkey?), but that&#8217;s understandable because it&#8217;s not that funny; it&#8217;s just not racist either.

With Trump, you never know about tomorrow.</p> \n\n<p>A look at some of his campaign promises and what's happened with them:</p> \n\n<p>TAXES</p> \n\n<p>Trump and congressional Republicans delivered on an overhaul that substantially lowers corporate taxes and cuts personal income taxes, as promised. It's sizable but not everything Trump said it would be, and it is more tilted to the wealthy than he promised or will admit. He promised a 15 percent tax rate for corporations and settled for 21 percent, still a major drop from 35 percent. He promised three tax brackets; there are still seven. He did not eliminate the estate tax or the alternative minimum tax as he said he would. Fewer people will be subject to those taxes, however, at least temporarily.</p> \n\n<p>\"Everybody is getting a tax cut, especially the middle class,\" he said in the campaign. Most will; some will pay more.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>TRADE</p> \n\n<p>Trump made good on his promise to withdraw the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement and to reopen the North American Free Trade Agreement in search of a better deal.</p> \n\n<p>He's let China off the hook, though, on his oft-repeated threat during the campaign to brand Beijing a currency manipulator, a step toward potentially hefty penalties on Chinese imports and a likely spark for a trade war.</p> \n\n<p>\"We're like the piggy bank that's being robbed,\" he said of the trade relationship, which has tipped even more in China's favor since. Trump now threatens trade punishment if China does not sufficiently cooperate in reining in North Korea.</p> \n\n<p>Trump promised to impose a 35 percent tariff on goods from U.S. companies that ship production abroad. He's not delivered on that. Instead, his tax plan aims to encourage companies to stay in the U.S. with the lower tax rate and to entice those operating abroad to come home by letting them repatriate their profits in the U.S. at a temporarily discounted rate. His approach so far is all carrot, no stick.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>IMMIGRATION</p> \n\n<p>Candidate Trump rocked the political landscape when he proposed a temporary ban on all non-U.S. Muslims entering the country. While he's long backed away from such talk, Trump has worked since his first days in office to impose new restrictions on tourists and immigrants, signing executive orders that would have made good on his anti-immigration promises had those orders not been blocked by courts.</p> \n\n<p>He's now succeeded in banning the entry of citizens from several Muslim-majority countries and in severely curbing refugee admissions. He's tried to deny certain federal money for cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.</p> \n\n<p>Trump is now deep in negotiations over an immigration deal that could deliver on other promises, including money for the border wall with Mexico and overhauling the legal immigration system to make it harder for immigrants to sponsor their families. That's in exchange for extending protections for hundreds of thousands of young people brought to the country illegally as children. They are protections he once slammed as an \"illegal\" amnesty and pledged to end.</p> \n\n<p>Mexico still isn't ponying up money for the wall.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT</p> \n\n<p>Trump promised aggressive action on the energy front and has pursued that.</p> \n\n<p>He announced his intention to take the U.S. out of the Paris climate-change accord. He gave swift approval to the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines stalled by President Barack Obama, moved to shrink protected national monument lands in Utah and Arizona, and acted to lift restrictions on mining coal and coastal drilling for oil and natural gas.</p> \n\n<p>A provision in the new tax law opens the long-protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.</p> \n\n<p>As other countries turn harder toward green energy, Trump is making fossil fuels the centerpiece of his drive toward energy independence &#8212; a benchmark that Obama closed in on during an era of surging natural gas development.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>HEALTH CARE</p> \n\n<p>Probably nothing exemplifies frustrated ambition more than the Obama health law Republicans have been trying to dismantle ever since it was enacted in 2010. Trump has declared it dead many times &#8212; he just never got around to killing it.</p> \n\n<p>He made this overpromise in the campaign: \"My first day in office, I'm going to ask Congress to put a bill on my desk getting rid of this disastrous law and replacing it with reforms that expand choice, freedom, affordability. You're going to have such great health care at a tiny fraction of the cost. It's going to be so easy.\"</p> \n\n<p>That hasn't happened.</p> \n\n<p>Republicans took several runs at repealing and replacing the law last year, only to fall short. The December tax law, though, is knocking out a pillar. As of 2019, the requirement to carry health insurance or pay a fine will be gone.</p> \n\n<p>Trump has come out with a proposed regulation to promote the sale of health plans across state lines. The goal is to make it easier for associations to sponsor plans that are cheaper than Affordable Care Act policies but don't have to meet all consumer protection and benefit requirements of that law.</p> \n\n<p>Insurance industry groups, patient groups and some state regulators are wary of the idea and see little chance it can make more than a dent in the ranks of the uninsured (nearly 30 million). Easing restrictions on the sale of health insurance across state lines has been a longtime mainstream conservative goal.</p> \n\n<p>He also promised to authorize Medicare to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. It hasn't been done.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>'AMERICA FIRST' ABROAD</p> \n\n<p>Trump promised swift victory over the Islamic State group. Over the past year, U.S. and coalition-backed local forces in Iraq and Syria did deal a crushing blow to IS, ousting the militants from most of the territory they once held. The success built on the strategy of the Obama administration to work with and through local forces. Trump did relax restrictions on the number of U.S. troops who could be deployed both to Iraq and Syria, and that aided the final push.</p> \n\n<p>U.S. commanders, however, stop short of saying IS is defeated, pointing to remaining militants and fighting in Syria. They also note the group has spawned affiliates in other countries, such as Afghanistan and Yemen, where they routinely attack U.S. forces and allies. While reeling as a territorial force, the IS group has inspired terrorist attacks in the West.</p> \n\n<p>The Pentagon has yet to see the massive increase in military spending that Trump has promised. That still might come, but the protracted struggle to pass a Pentagon budget of whatever size has hurt U.S. military readiness, defense officials say.</p> \n\n<p>More broadly, Trump's \"America First\" ethic has been reflected in his pressure on member NATO countries to step up their own military spending, in his wariness of international accords and in the seeming drift from a diplomatic tradition of promoting U.S. democratic values abroad.</p> \n\n<p>Past presidents made common cause with authoritarian figures, and their promotion of values could be cursory. But Trump has lavished praise on select strongmen, from the Philippines to China to Russia and beyond.</p> \n\n<p>Despite railing against the Iran nuclear deal as a candidate, Trump has so far passed up opportunities to get the U.S. out of it. On the other hand, he rolled back part of Obama's opening to Cuba. He also moved forward on recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a goal that both parties have embraced in their platforms for decades but never acted on.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>INFRASTRUCTURE</p> \n\n<p>Trump pledged a $1 trillion effort to rebuild the country's airports, roads, bridges and other infrastructure. As with his tax plan, it's shaping up to be less ambitious than promised, though it still might be significant. Placed behind the failed effort to repeal the health law and the successful one to cut taxes, infrastructure may or may not emerge as a proposal in coming weeks. Trump's idea appears to involve using federal tax dollars to leverage state government and private spending, not to mount a New Deal-era explosion of federal projects.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>VETERANS</p> \n\n<p>Having previously criticized the Department of Veterans Affairs as the \"most corrupt,\" Trump delivered on one campaign promise by signing legislation to make it easier for VA employees to be fired for misconduct.</p> \n\n<p>At least for now, its impact in bringing accountability to the department remains unclear. The pace of VA firings during Obama's last budget year was higher than during Trump's first, which covered the first nine months of his administration.</p> \n\n<p>Other Trump initiatives announced with fanfare in 2017 remain far from complete or have been limited because of questions about rising government costs: a multibillion-dollar overhaul of electronic medical records, expanded access to doctors to reduce wait times and a goal of hiring 1,000 additional mental health counselors in the first year. The VA has been clouded by a 2014 scandal at the Phoenix VA hospital in which employees manipulated records to hide appointment delays.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>... AND MORE</p> \n\n<p>Despite his promises, Trump hasn't pushed for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on Congress members or worked to end birthright citizenship, and he hasn't made good on his pledge to drop \"dirty, rotten traitor\" Bowe Bergdahl out of an airplane over Afghanistan without a parachute.</p> \n\n<p>Trump, who spends nearly every weekend golfing at one of his properties, most certainly hasn't fulfilled his promise never to take a vacation while serving as president.</p> \n\n<p>Indeed, Trump has visited properties he owns nearly one of every three days he's been in office, raising a tangle of ethical questions about whether he's profiting from his presidency.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>THE BIG BOAST</p> \n\n<p>Trump didn't wait for his first 100 days to expire before boasting that his presidential achievements thus far surpassed anything in history, and he hasn't let up since. He's bragged of having signed more than 80 pieces of legislation into law, but there's little of consequence in that pile.</p> \n\n<p>He's signed laws naming federal buildings after people, appointing a Smithsonian Institution regent and other housekeeping steps that all presidents do but tend not to make a fuss about.</p> \n\n<p>In contrast, Obama signed an enormous stimulus package into law in his first month while also achieving a law expanding health care for children and other policy steps.</p> \n\n<p>Then there's Franklin Roosevelt, credited by historians Alan Brinkley and Davis Dyer with achieving \"the most concentrated period of U.S. reform in U.S. history,\" starting immediately with emergency legislation to stabilize the Depression-devastated banking system and setting in place the New Deal with 14 pieces of historic legislation in 100 days.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Associated Press writer Hope Yen contributed to this report.</p> \n\n<p>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8212; President Donald Trump often brags that he's done more in his first year in office than any other president.

Trump did relax restrictions on the number of U.S. troops who could be deployed both to Iraq and Syria, and that aided the final push.</p> \n\n<p>U.S. commanders, however, stop short of saying IS is defeated, pointing to remaining militants and fighting in Syria. They also note the group has spawned affiliates in other countries, such as Afghanistan and Yemen, where they routinely attack U.S. forces and allies. While reeling as a territorial force, the IS group has inspired terrorist attacks in the West.</p> \n\n<p>The Pentagon has yet to see the massive increase in military spending that Trump has promised. That still might come, but the protracted struggle to pass a Pentagon budget of whatever size has hurt U.S. military readiness, defense officials say.</p> \n\n<p>More broadly, Trump's \"America First\" ethic has been reflected in his pressure on member NATO countries to step up their own military spending, in his wariness of international accords and in the seeming drift from a diplomatic tradition of promoting U.S. democratic values abroad.</p> \n\n<p>Past presidents made common cause with authoritarian figures, and their promotion of values could be cursory. But Trump has lavished praise on select strongmen, from the Philippines to China to Russia and beyond.</p> \n\n<p>Despite railing against the Iran nuclear deal as a candidate, Trump has so far passed up opportunities to get the U.S. out of it. On the other hand, he rolled back part of Obama's opening to Cuba. He also moved forward on recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a goal that both parties have embraced in their platforms for decades but never acted on.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>INFRASTRUCTURE</p> \n\n<p>Trump pledged a $1 trillion effort to rebuild the country's airports, roads, bridges and other infrastructure. As with his tax plan, it's shaping up to be less ambitious than promised, though it still might be significant. Placed behind the failed effort to repeal the health law and the successful one to cut taxes, infrastructure may or may not emerge as a proposal in coming weeks. Trump's idea appears to involve using federal tax dollars to leverage state government and private spending, not to mount a New Deal-era explosion of federal projects.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>VETERANS</p> \n\n<p>Having previously criticized the Department of Veterans Affairs as the \"most corrupt,\" Trump delivered on one campaign promise by signing legislation to make it easier for VA employees to be fired for misconduct.</p> \n\n<p>At least for now, its impact in bringing accountability to the department remains unclear. The pace of VA firings during Obama's last budget year was higher than during Trump's first, which covered the first nine months of his administration.</p> \n\n<p>Other Trump initiatives announced with fanfare in 2017 remain far from complete or have been limited because of questions about rising government costs: a multibillion-dollar overhaul of electronic medical records, expanded access to doctors to reduce wait times and a goal of hiring 1,000 additional mental health counselors in the first year. The VA has been clouded by a 2014 scandal at the Phoenix VA hospital in which employees manipulated records to hide appointment delays.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>... AND MORE</p> \n\n<p>Despite his promises, Trump hasn't pushed for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on Congress members or worked to end birthright citizenship, and he hasn't made good on his pledge to drop \"dirty, rotten traitor\" Bowe Bergdahl out of an airplane over Afghanistan without a parachute.</p> \n\n<p>Trump, who spends nearly every weekend golfing at one of his properties, most certainly hasn't fulfilled his promise never to take a vacation while serving as president.</p> \n\n<p>Indeed, Trump has visited properties he owns nearly one of every three days he's been in office, raising a tangle of ethical questions about whether he's profiting from his presidency.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>THE BIG BOAST</p> \n\n<p>Trump didn't wait for his first 100 days to expire before boasting that his presidential achievements thus far surpassed anything in history, and he hasn't let up since. He's bragged of having signed more than 80 pieces of legislation into law, but there's little of consequence in that pile.</p> \n\n<p>He's signed laws naming federal buildings after people, appointing a Smithsonian Institution regent and other housekeeping steps that all presidents do but tend not to make a fuss about.</p> \n\n<p>In contrast, Obama signed an enormous stimulus package into law in his first month while also achieving a law expanding health care for children and other policy steps.</p> \n\n<p>Then there's Franklin Roosevelt, credited by historians Alan Brinkley and Davis Dyer with achieving \"the most concentrated period of U.S. reform in U.S. history,\" starting immediately with emergency legislation to stabilize the Depression-devastated banking system and setting in place the New Deal with 14 pieces of historic legislation in 100 days.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Associated Press writer Hope Yen contributed to this report.</p>", "title": "Trump has kept many promises during his first year in office", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://apnews.com/amp/4c2dce305b4a4d679785fc48bd278704", "published_at": "2018-01-15", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck Indonesia's&amp;#160;Sulawesi Island on Sunday, killing at least 6 people, seriously wounding 8, and slightly injuring 35, according to the <a href=\"http://www.bnpb.go.id/website/asp/berita_list.asp?id=973\" type=\"external\">National Disaster Management Agency</a>&amp;#160;(BNPB).

The poll was conducted to gauge changes in ED patient volume and care since the Affordable Care Act went into effect.</p> \n\n<p>With the implementation of the ACA, 47% of emergency physicians reported a slight increase in the number of patients, and 28% reported significant increases in patient volume.</p> \n\n<p>56% of emergency physicians&amp;#160;reported an increase in the number of Medicare patients, and 70% fear their ED is not sufficiently prepared for an increase in patient volume.

For example, the closure of a hospital in Baton Rouge resulted in a crisis for another hospital that inherited all the patients, many of whom are uninsured, and now this hospital may close as well.

Kay appeared before a Senate subcommittee to disclose his findings and admitted that he and his team had found no stockpiles of proscribed weapons in Iraq.</p> \n\n<p>At one point he opined, &#8220;We were wrong, we were all wrong.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Wrong?</p> \n\n<p>An estimated 8,000 innocent Iraqis died in the invasion, more than 500 American servicemen were killed in action, an entire country was destabilized and plunged into insurgency, and David Kay talks about being wrong like it was some minor miscalculation on the phone bill?</p> \n\n<p>This is the reality of the Bush Administration&#8217;s new &#8220;preemptive&#8221; theory; hundreds of billions of dollars are spent, countless lives are lost or ruined, and the world community is thrown into turmoil, and yet, no justification is provided.</p> \n\n<p>Even worse, the head of the weapons inspection team presents his case to Congress as though it was all &#8220;just an honest mistake&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>So, why did Kay choose to address the Senate in the first place?</p> \n\n<p>After all, Kay has been a reliable Bush loyalist, and that hasn&#8217;t changed.</p> \n\n<p>Kay&#8217;s real intention in addressing the Senate was to use the CIA as a scapegoat for the bad information that led to the war. Now, that the election is approaching, the President&#8217;s chief advisor, Karl Rove, is trying to put as much distance as he can between the White House and the myriad lies about the non-existent weapons.</p> \n\n<p>This is a delicate situation and has to be handled with great subtlety or intelligence agencies will see that Bush is trying to bury them in the media. Hence, the appearance of David Kay is intended to reinforce the false notion that the war was the result of faulty intelligence. Kay&#8217;s testimony challenged the reliability of intelligence gathering methods and suggested that we may need a &#8220;major overhaul&#8221; of the intelligence services.</p> \n\n<p>Absent from the testimony was any detailed recounting of the many fabrications that were repeated with propaganda-like precision to support the war. Also, absent was the clear implication that the Administration was directly involved in &#8220;cherry-picking&#8221; intelligence to suit its own purposes.</p> \n\n<p>Apart from Senator Edward Kennedy, there was no mention of the fact that the Vice President was pressuring the CIA with frequent visits to produce information that was compatible with his own warmongering objectives, or that an Office of Special Plans was developed in the Pentagon for the expressed purpose of selectively manufacturing evidence that Saddam was a threat.</p> \n\n<p>Most of this passed by completely unnoticed. Instead, the Administration has adroitly used its main inspector to &#8220;move the shells&#8221; one more time, and shift the blame onto the undeserving CIA.</p> \n\n<p>But, the CIA doesn&#8217;t create policy and it doesn&#8217;t make the decision to go to war; the President does.</p> \n\n<p>The CIA was skeptical about the Iraq threat from the very beginning. Its reluctance to endorse the Bush preemptive policy was evident in an earlier report that clearly stated that a war in Iraq would increase the likelihood of terrorism in the region and, perhaps, force Saddam to give whatever weapons he had to terrorist organizations.</p> \n\n<p>This warning was ignored.</p> \n\n<p>It seems only appropriate that Kay would give his report on a day when six more American servicemen and eleven more Iraqis were killed. His loyalty to the Bush policy of unprovoked aggression provides an interesting contrast to the grim facts on the ground. Men and women are dying every day in what we know now was an entirely avoidable war.</p> \n\n<p>The testimony of David Kay only confirms that point.</p> \n\n<p>MIKE WHITNEY can be reached at: <a href=\"mailto:fergiewhitney@msn.com\" type=\"external\">fergiewhitney@msn.com</a></p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "The David Kay Report", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2004/01/30/the-david-kay-report/", "published_at": "2004-01-30", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>For the Halloween episode of <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/podcasts/answers/?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;referring_guid=b48e2aec-c2db-11e7-a29c-0050569d32b9&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Motley Fool Answers Opens a New Window.</a>, Alison Southwick and Robert Brokamp engage in a spirited discussion of the horrors some folks have visited upon their families' finances from the afterlife by making big mistakes in estate planning.</p> \n\n<p>In this segment, they discuss a nonfamous fellow, DuPont&amp;#160;employee William Kennedy, who -- as sometimes happens -- divorced his wife.

Not part of the famous Kennedy family. This Kennedy worked for DuPont and participated in the company's retirement plan. In 1994 he and his wife, whose name was Liv, got divorced and in the agreement she waived any rights to his retirement plan.</p> \n\n<p>Seven years later, William passes away. The money, however, was sent from the retirement plan to the wife. Why? Because William did not update the beneficiary form on his retirement plan. When you signed up for your 401(k) at work, you filled out the beneficiary form, but you also have that on IRAs. You have it on life insurance policies. There are all types of different assets and accounts in which you've filled out the beneficiary form.</p> \n\n<p>He didn't update it, so the daughter who should have [or at least she thought] should have inherited the money took it to court. Went all the way to the Supreme Court in 2009. They decided for Liv, the ex-wife. She's the one who gets the $400,000.</p> \n\n<p>Southwick: Oh, that's not bad! That's not too shabby.</p> \n\n<p>Brokamp: No, not too bad.

However deep their divisions, they keep them secret from the outside world.</p> \n\n<p>Not so the Libyan rebels. Members of their Transitional National Council (TNC) in Benghazi last month detained their military leader, General Abdel Fatah Younes, on suspicion of treachery, lured him away from his bodyguards and murdered him. This week the head of the TNC, Mustafa Abdel Jalil, sacked his whole government on the grounds that some were complicit in the killing. He was apparently forced to do so in order to quell the rage of the powerful Obeidi tribe to which Younes belonged.</p> \n\n<p>A ludicrous aspect of the whole affair is that at the very moment the rebel leaders are at each other&#8217;s throats, they are being recognised by country after country as the legitimate government of Libya. This week TNC diplomats took over the Libyan embassies in London and Washington and are about to do so in Ottawa. In a masterpiece of mistiming, Britain recognized the rebel government on the day when some of its members were shooting their own commander-in-chief and burning his body.</p> \n\n<p>If this is how the rebels behave today, when it is much in their interests to make a show of unity, how will they act once they are installed in power in Tripoli? But NATO&#8217;s sole policy is to do just that. A UN Security Council resolution, intended to stop Gaddafi&#8217;s tanks taking Benghazi for humanitarian reasons in March, transmuted rapidly into a bid to overthrow him. Britain and France, with essential backing from the US, still maintain that the good of the Libyan people requires the replacement of Gaddafi with those sturdy democrats from Benghazi and eastern Libya represented by the TNC.</p> \n\n<p>Could a strategy of brute force work in a purely military sense? Could the rebel columns of pick-up trucks with machine-guns in the back advance to capture Tripoli behind a creeping barrage supplied by NATO firepower? The Libyan capital is increasingly short of fuel, consumer goods and electricity.</p> \n\n<p>The rebels have been making gains on the ground to the east and south-west of the capital. But even with the support of NATO air strikes the advance has been slow. If the rebels make such a meal of taking a town like Brega, with a population of 4,000, on the Gulf of Sirte, can they really fight their way into Tripoli with a population of 1.7 million?</p> \n\n<p>Gaddafi may fall, but it looks increasingly that, if he does, it will be at the hands of a rag-tag collection of militias ever more dependent for success on being backed by tactical support from NATO aircraft. Given that the rebels lack a coherent leadership or a united military force, the outcome is unlikely to be a clear-cut victory. Even if victorious, the rebels will depend on foreign support at every level to exert authority over this vast country.</p> \n\n<p>As with Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003, the US and Britain found it was one thing to overthrow the Taliban or Saddam Hussein and quite another to replace them. Treating dubious local allies as the legitimate government has a propaganda value, but it is unwise to pretend that the local partner carries real authority. With this experience under its belt, it required real fecklessness for Britain to plunge into another conflict on the assumption that this time we were betting on a certain winner. Gaddafi may be overthrown but the struggle for power between internal factions is likely to continue.</p> \n\n<p>Colorful, but woefully misleading</p> \n\n<p>The foreign media had its failings in Iraq, was worse in Afghanistan but has reached its nadir in covering the war in Libya. Reporting has become largely militarized. Much of it is colorful stuff from the frontline about the dashes backwards and forwards of rebel militiamen. It takes courage to report this and reporters naturally empathize with the young men with whom they are sharing a trench. Their coverage tends to be wholly in favor of the rebels and in opposition to Gaddafi.</p> \n\n<p>When Abdel Fatah Younes was murdered almost nobody in the foreign media had an explanation as to how or why it had happened. The rebel leadership, previously portrayed as a heroic band of brothers, turned out to be split by murderous rivalries and vendettas. Some reporters simply regurgitated the rebel authorities&#8217; unlikely claim that the general had been killed by pro-Gaddafi fighters with camps in Benghazi, while others mentioned that there were 30 different Islamic militias in the city.</p> \n\n<p>To this day politicians justify NATO&#8217;s intervention in Libya by citing atrocities supposedly carried out by pro-Gaddafi forces such as mass rape or extensive use of mercenaries. Human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch long ago revealed that there was no evidence for most of the atrocity stories, as did a UN commission headed by the distinguished legal scholar Cherif Bassiouni. These well-researched reports were almost entirely ignored by the media which first published the Gaddafi atrocity stories.</p> \n\n<p>The militarization of reporting in Iraq and Afghanistan was boosted by the system of &#8220;embedding&#8221; reporters with military units. This was inevitable to a degree given the danger from Iraqi insurgents or Taliban.

The first leg&amp;#160;was a 30-minute nighttime flight from Aleppo to Damascus. The plane was roaring down the runway &#8212; and then&amp;#160;came to a grinding halt.</p> \n\n<p>The flight attendants told the passengers to close their window shades.&amp;#160;&#8220;The [guy] sitting next to my dad,&amp;#160;his window was open a little bit, so my dad saw that there was a helicopter,\" Karen says. \"And it was shooting.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It was night,&amp;#160;so you could see the bullets flying both ways, up and down,\" remembers Harout, Karen's father.</p> \n\n<p>Ten minutes later, the plane took off.</p> \n\n<p>Karen and her family spent the night in Damascus. They met a taxi first thing in the morning and&amp;#160;made the six-hour drive to&amp;#160;Beirut &#8212;&amp;#160;twice as long as usual. Karen slept for most of the ride, but at some point she remembers looking out the window.

That's a&amp;#160;quarter of the population of Lebanon itself, and the UN's count is likely low.

(NYSE: SCS) rose 12.8% Thursday after the office furniture specialist released weaker-than-expected fiscal second-quarter 2017 results, but offered encouraging guidance for a return to growth going forward.</p> \n\n<p>Quarterly revenue fell 7% year over year, to $758 million, and translated to net income of $38.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share. Excluding restructuring charges, Steelcase's net income fell 8.6% year over year, to $0.32 per diluted share. By contrast, Steelcase's outlook called for revenue in the range of $770 million to $795 million, but roughly the same earnings per share (on both a GAAP and adjusted basis) in the range of $0.29 to $0.33.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Steelcase CEO Jim Keane explained that July orders fell 8% in the Americas, leading to lower overall revenue than anticipated. But Keane also added:</p> \n\n<p>More specifically, Steelcase expects fiscal third-quarter revenue of $795 million to $820 million, including organic revenue growth of 1% to 4%. On the bottom line, Steelcase expects third-quarter earnings per diluted share of $0.32 to $0.36, including a $0.01 per-share negative impact from restructuring costs.</p> \n\n<p>By contrast, analysts' consensus estimates predicted Steelcase would achieve revenue of $807.4 million in the quarter, and adjusted earnings of $0.35 per share.</p> \n\n<p>Of course, that guidance wasn't overwhelmingly positive, and more than anything confirmed what Wall Street was hoping to hear. So in light of its relative underperformance in Q2, it's somewhat surprising to see shares of Steelcase climb so much in today's trading. To be fair, however, it's worth noting shares are still down more than 20% over the past year, indicating perhaps investors were were willing to buy Steelcase stock in light of any perceived turning point for the company.</p> \n\n<p>In the end, while I'm not personally anxious to dive in and buy Steelcase stock today, I think it's worth adding to your watch list to keep tabs on its progress.</p> \n\n<p>A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

But little of the coverage of URSUS focuses on the question of incentives within law enforcement agencies. As Harvard law professor <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/02/opinion/controlling-the-cops-accomplices-to-perjury.html\" type=\"external\">Alan Dershowitz</a> and many others have written over the past 40 years, police of all ranks have many reasons to create tidy narratives about their actions.</p> \n\n<p>Officers have an incentive to not report their violent incidents and to depict injuries suffered by suspects as not their fault; the other officers who witness such violence have an incentive to not report or to inaccurately depict such injuries because of a police culture with a still-strong &#8220;code of silence&#8221;; and police chiefs and top police brass have an incentive to not accurately report incidents within their ranks because of concerns on how it would reflect on them and their departments.</p> \n\n<p>This long history of police not acting to limit misconduct is a factor in the huge gap between African American and white perceptions of police misconduct, according to <a href=\"http://www.nij.gov/topics/law-enforcement/legitimacy/pages/welcome.aspx\" type=\"external\">recent research</a> by the U.S. Justice Department&#8217;s Office of Justice.</p> \n\n<p>Now the San Francisco Chronicle, <a href=\"http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Gaps-in-SF-state-counts-of-police-killings-10154853.php\" type=\"external\">analyzing research</a> done by Texas State University covering the years from 2006-2015, has given an example of how the incentives for police to resist oversight have resulted in a lax police culture in California.</p> \n\n<p>A state law adopted long before the controversies over police killings in New York City, Baltimore and Cleveland requires local law enforcement to report fatal shootings by officers to the state government.</p> \n\n<p>But the Chronicle&#8217;s analysis found it to be broadly ignored over the 10 years of data compiled by Texas State University researchers.

The 10-year average of unreported police killings was 30 percent. Last year, the percentage appears to be closer to 25 percent, though exact numbers are not yet available.</p> \n\n<p>But in San Francisco, the percentage of unreported police killings in 2015 was 100 percent. The Chronicle said city police officials didn&#8217;t notify the state of any of the six police killings last year.</p>", "title": "Study: 30% of CA police killings not reported to state", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://calwatchdog.com/2016/11/01/study-30-ca-police-killings-not-reported-state/", "published_at": "2018-11-20", "bias": 3}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>This week Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) reported a 93% jump in revenue compared to last year. It went public back in May and has seen its stock jump 86% since. That&#8217;s because Shopify (and its many competitors, from Magento to Bigcommerce) are considered to be the future of e-commerce for small retailers. And that&#8217;s true. But there&#8217;s also something else bigger than just e-commerce.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>That&#8217;s because applications like Shopify will be just as important to those many retailers where e-commerce isn&#8217;t as big a factor. And for those retailers, moving to this technology will be the difference not just for a successful holiday season but for long term survival as well.</p> \n\n<p>A small, real-life example. There is a pharmacy located in my neighborhood that has been around since the mid-1950&#8217;s. It&#8217;s a family business and it provides a livelihood for its owners. And every day I watch this little pharmacy slowly die. No, they don&#8217;t have an e-commerce presence &#8211; they barely have a website. But that&#8217;s not the real reason why they&#8217;re dying. &amp;#160;It&#8217;s because they&#8217;re getting crushed by larger competitors, a CVS (NYSE:CVS) and a Rite-Aid (NYSE:RAD) which is being acquired by Walgreen&#8217;s (NYSE:WAG), are each located a mile away. And yet, this little pharmacy doesn&#8217;t have to fail. It can compete against the big box stores. It can become vibrant and relevant and successful. They need the kind of technology that a Shopify has.</p> \n\n<p>Shopify and its competitors aren&#8217;t just e-commerce. They are mobile point-of-sale, payment and inventory management applications that are dovetailed with e-commerce. And that&#8217;s the big misunderstanding about applications like these.</p> \n\n<p>They are designed to be used both in-house and online. Shopify&#8217;s unlimited plan, which is less than $200 per month, will enable the little pharmacist down the street to take a big jump into the 21st century. Online, he can setup his own store where customers can search, order and pay for unlimited products for either delivery or pickup &#8211; a critical customer service in today&#8217;s attention-deficit-disorder world. But it&#8217;s in the store where products like Shopify will have the most impact.</p> \n\n<p>The application is designed for the iPad so that store employees, and yes even the pharmacist himself, can come out from behind the counter, walk the aisle and engage with customers face to face, helping them search for the right product, taking orders and even receiving payment. The application lets him offer gift cards and discount codes. If implemented the right way its inventory and reporting will allow the pharmacist to stay on top of his stock and analyze which products are moving the best. And I&#8217;m really just scratching the surface. This is all in-house stuff, not online. And we&#8217;re not getting this at the big box places. It&#8217;s a value-add that any smart business owner can do to strengthen his relationship with his customers and community.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>And there&#8217;s more technology for that that the brick-and-mortar retailer, like my pharmacist friend, to help him succeed.</p> \n\n<p>For example, he can use a free service called Happy E-Mail to make sure his customers are getting a special e-mail thank you from him after they&#8217;ve made their purchase. Or a specially designed purchase receipt from Receiptful that upsells on future items. Another free product called Limespot will prompt sales associates of opportunities to recommend other related products and accessories while still engaging with the customer in the store. A product called Sweet Tooth will offer customers points for their loyalty which they can use for discounts on future sales. These are just a few of the hundreds of apps available to enhance the in-store experience.</p> \n\n<p>And that&#8217;s the biggest misunderstanding: e-commerce and brick-and-mortar are becoming the same. &amp;#160;All retailers who want to grow will use technology like Shopify for both online and in-store. The store employee and the online visitor is searching the same inventory database. The loyalty programs and e-mail confirmations are being triggered whether the purchase is made in-store or via the web. Because of the cloud there&#8217;s no such thing as two systems &#8211; it&#8217;s all one system. It&#8217;s all mobile.

Hire someone short-term to help (Shopify has a marketplace of experts and even more can be found on sites like UpWork). Move all inventory on to a platform like Shopify. Buy a few iPads from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and link to a few good loyalty and communication services. And get his employees walking around the store helping customers face to face. And don&#8217;t worry about ecommerce, because that&#8217;s part of the package. It&#8217;s all the same. It&#8217;s all one system.

Two groups working for a cleaner future want to see a levy imposed on fossil fuel exploitation.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>A 2013 report said almost two-thirds of the main greenhouse gas going into the atmosphere, carbon dioxide, came from the fuels produced by a mere 90 companies. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) summit here is in the final hours of its attempt to broker a just and effective global treaty on reducing those emissions and limiting their impacts: extreme weather, drought, flooding, sea level rise, land and forest degradation, desertification.</p> \n\n<p>Pressure is growing to work out if and how these big fossil fuel producers can be held financially responsible for the damage their products are causing.</p> \n\n<p>The 90 fossil fuel companies responsible for 63% of CO2 emissions from human activities are a roll call of household names, including Chevron, ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, BP, Gazprom and Shell.</p> \n\n<p>Now the Climate Justice Programme and the Heinrich Boell Foundation are urging that producers should pay a carbon levy on all fossil fuel extraction and mining, with the proceeds going to help pay poorer countries for adapting to climate change and meeting the costs of its impacts.</p> \n\n<p>Phase-out needed</p> \n\n<p>The levy would be applied to both the exploitation and the burning of fossil fuels. If a company was involved in both, it would have to pay the levy only once.</p> \n\n<p>It would charge the carbon majors US$2 for every tonne of carbon dioxide their products release into the atmosphere. In 2014 this would have meant $50 billion coming from the companies.</p> \n\n<p>The levy is based on a calculation of how much CO2 is released on average from burning a barrel of crude oil (or a tonne of coal, or a cubic metre of natural gas). The CO2 footprint of the drilling or mining itself would not be taken into account.</p> \n\n<p>\"We propose that a global fossil fuel extraction levy be established and paid into the international Loss and Damage Mechanism. This funding would be used to assist the poorest and most vulnerable communities suffering the worst impacts of climate change\", said Julie-Anne Richards of the Climate Justice Programme. \"This levy needs to be part of a general phase-out of fossil fuels.\"</p> \n\n<p>Precedents</p> \n\n<p>The UNFCCC's Loss and Damage Mechanism emerged from the 2013 climate summit in Warsaw. It is a way to address those climate impacts to which it is impossible to adapt, including extreme events.</p> \n\n<p>\"Climate finance is already inadequate - with a huge gap between what is needed and what is being offered. A new source of finance from a levy on Big Oil, Coal and Gas could unlock some of the objections by rich countries to including loss and damage in a new Paris agreement\", said Lili Fuhr from the Heinrich Boell Foundation.</p> \n\n<p>The Climate Justice Programme is convinced that existing international law, in particular the polluter pays principle, the no harm rule and the right to compensation support such a system.</p> \n\n<p>\"Our proposal draws from precedents such as the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, the oil spill compensation regime which collects levies from companies that ship oil internationally which are used as compensation after oil spills\", said Julie-Anne Richards.</p> \n\n<p>The fossil fuel industry has so far given no reaction to the levy proposal.</p> \n\n<p>Henner Weithoener is a Berlin-based freelance journalist specialising in renewable energy and climate change.</p>", "title": "A Carbon Levy Is Possible for Big Fossil Fuel Firms", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/a-carbon-levy-is-possible-for-big-fossil-fuel-firms/", "published_at": "2015-12-11", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........</p> \n\n<p>FILE - In this Dec. 16, 2014, file photo a man leaves the headquarters of Uber in San Francisco. Uber says Jason Dalton, the man suspected of going on a western Michigan shooting rampage that left six people dead was one of its drivers. Spokeswoman Nairi Hourdajian wouldn't say Sunday, Feb. 21, 2016 whether Dalton was driving for the ride-sharing service Saturday night when the shootings occurred outside an apartment complex, car dealership and restaurant in and around Kalamazoo. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)</p> \n\n<p>SAN FRANCISCO - A Michigan mass shooting could raise new headaches for Uber, the fast-growing ride-hailing service that's been dogged by controversy on the road to becoming one of the most valuable, privately funded companies in the world.</p> \n\n<p>Jason Dalton, the man arrested in connection with the Kalamazoo rampage that left six people dead, was a driver for the San Francisco-based Uber, according to a company spokeswoman. Authorities were investigating reports that he may have picked up at least one customer before he was stopped by police.</p> \n\n<p>Uber has been one of the most successful tech industry startups in recent years, as customers have flocked to use its smartphone app for hailing rides in 380 cities around the globe. The company says its drivers are independent contractors who use its app to help find customers and schedule trips.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Since its launch in 2009, Uber has faced criticism for a pricing formula that can send rates skyrocketing at times of high demand, and for side-stepping regulators and licensing requirements in some cities where it's opened for business. That hasn't stopped it from raising more than $10 billion in financial backing from venture capital firms and other investors, under terms that value the company at more than $50 billion.</p> \n\n<p>It was unclear Sunday if the fatal shootings in Kalamazoo had any relation to Jason Dalton's employment. But critics have long complained the company should do more to screen drivers and guard passengers' safety.</p> \n\n<p>Some of that criticism has been raised by competitors and regulators who argue that Uber's success has come as the company has expanded while seeking to avoid the strict licensing and permit requirements that traditional taxi companies face.</p> \n\n<p>\"I do think this is an outrageous incident that's going to draw more attention to this issue,\" said Dave Sutton, spokesman for \"Who's Driving You,\" an organization backed by Uber's competitors in the taxi and limousine industry, which has fought the company's expansion.</p> \n\n<p>Authorities said Dalton is a 45-year-old resident of Kalamazoo Township who had no criminal record. They said victims of the shootings in and around the city of Kalamazoo had no apparent connection to him or to each other.</p> \n\n<p>Uber spokeswoman Nairi Hourdajian confirmed Dalton had driven for Uber. Hourdajian wouldn't say whether he was picking up fares for the ride-sharing service Saturday night.</p> \n\n<p>Authorities, however, said they're investigating a Facebook post which indicated the suspect was an Uber driver who was driving erratically around the time of the shootings and indicating he may have taken at least one fare during an ensuing manhunt, according to Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeff Getting.</p> \n\n<p>Uber said Sunday that it has offered to assist authorities in their investigation. In a statement, Uber chief security officer Joe Sullivan said the company is \"horrified and heartbroken at the senseless violence.\"</p> \n\n<p>While Uber says it screens drivers and conducts background checks, critics say the ride-hailing company uses private screening services that don't have access to as much information as local police can obtain when they check fingerprint records.</p> \n\n<p>The company said earlier this month that it will pay $28.5 million to settle two lawsuits that alleged Uber misled customers about safety procedures and fees. It's also facing a separate a lawsuit by district attorneys in San Francisco and Los Angeles, who alleged that Uber's checks failed to prevent the company from hiring several felons.</p> \n\n<p>Uber, meanwhile, instituted a policy last year that prohibits driver and passengers from possessing firearms. Anyone found to be in violation of the policy may be prohibited from using or driving for the service.</p> \n\n<p>While there have been several cases in which Uber drivers have been charged with assaulting passengers, there have also been incidents in which the company's drivers have been attacked by passengers.</p> \n\n<p>Uber has also faced complaints that one of its executives in New York used information collected by the Uber app to track a passenger's movements. The company has since said that it has taken steps to protect passenger's privacy, including strict limits on access to the identities of riders.</p>", "title": "Uber says suspected Michigan gunman was driver for service", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/728033/uber-says-suspected-michigan-gunman-was-driver-for-service.html", "published_at": "", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Even so, shorts, t-shirts and bare feet were requisite attire as the University of New Mexico beach volleyball team practiced on the sand courts adjacent to Lucky 66 Bowl. The Lobos open their third season of competition next week in Arizona and the 2017 forecast calls for mostly sunshine.</p> \n\n<p>UNM returns its top three pairs from last season, when it finished 17-9 and was nationally ranked for much of the year. That success should serve as a good starting point, Lobo coach Jeff Nelson said at his team&#8217;s media day Monday.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We have more depth, we&#8217;re more physical and we&#8217;ve experienced some success,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;We&#8217;re far ahead of where we were at this time last year, so we should have high expectations. It&#8217;s a solid group.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>With a handful of new arrivals on the squad, Nelson said he may end up switching some pair alignments as the season warms up. But when UNM travels to Phoenix for five matches next week, its top three pairs will have a full season of chemistry on which to draw.</p> \n\n<p>Senior Cassie House and junior Ashley Kelsey will play the No. 1 position. House and Kelsey posted an 11-10 record playing at No. 1 last season, despite facing some of the nation&#8217;s most talented, experienced pairs.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re two peas in a pod,&#8221; House said. &#8220;Playing with AK for a whole season really helped with chemistry. We&#8217;re ahead of where we were at the end of last season, and I think the whole group feels that way.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Seniors Lis&#233; Rugland and Devanne Sours, who went 14-6 at the No. 2 pairs position, also are confident they can improve. Sours, who never played in the sand prior to her sophomore year at UNM, said she&#8217;s now comfortable with the tactics and strategy necessary in two-person volleyball.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;There is a learning curve,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but we&#8217;ve worked our way through that. Expectations definitely are higher now and I think it can be a really good season.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>UNM&#8217;s most successful pair from 2016 will have to elevate its play if the Lobos are to make a run at postseason berth. Senior Marisa Doran and junior Eastyn Baleto went 22-3 at the No. 4 position last year but will move up to No. 3 this season.</p> \n\n<p>The Lobos&#8217; other two scoring pairs will be new. Senior Julia Warren, who paired with since-graduated Hannah Johnson last season, will team up with freshman Lauren Twitty at No. 4. Junior Jackie Baro will team up with sophomore transfer Carly Beddingfield at No. 5.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;All five pairs have at least one tall player and a legitimate block,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;We&#8217;re getting full-blown swings at all five spots. We definitely didn&#8217;t have that last year.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Much like last season, UNM will face a challenging schedule with the vast majority of its matches on the road. Just three of their 27 matches are scheduled at the Lucky 66 courts, which will serve as home for a second straight season.</p> \n\n<p>Nelson and his players are not complaining, however. They&#8217;ll fly to three road tournaments and drive to three after boarding an airplane just once in 2016.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I love our schedule,&#8221; Nelson said. &#8220;We play at least one nationally ranked team pretty much every weekend and usually more than one. We&#8217;ll be in some battles.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The NCAA sanctioned an eight-team championship tournament for the first time last season and will keep the same format in 2017. Five spots are filled by conference champions, leaving non-conference-affiliated teams like UNM to battle for three at-large spots.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s a tough assignment, but the Lobos are ready to take their shot.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re shooting for postseason,&#8221; House said, &#8220;no question. In fact, I think we&#8217;ll all be disappointed if we don&#8217;t get it.&#8221;</p>", "title": "UNM beach volleyball team has experience", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/953863/unm-beach-volleyball-team-has-experience.html", "published_at": "", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>WARSAW, Poland (AP) &#8212; Poland&#8217;s lawmakers have voted to approve the nation&#8217;s budget for 2018 that assumes 3.8 percent economic growth and a deficit well within European Union requirements.</p> \n\n<p>The state budget approved Thursday pegs the deficit at no more than 41.5 billion zlotys ($11.8 billion) with income of 355.7 billion zlotys ($102 billion).</p> \n\n<p>Inflation is foreseen at 2.3 percent and the deficit at 2.7 percent of gross domestic product.</p> \n\n<p>The Senate and President Andrzej Duda still need to endorse the budget bill.</p> \n\n<p>The conservative government is pursuing a generous social policy of benefits for families with small children, which fuels economic growth through greater demand for goods and services.

Never at a loss for a cliche, I state that not long ago I was several leagues to the right of Genghiz Khan, and replied to Ye Ed that &#8220;I was a thorough-going, kill-a-commie-for-Christ, jackboot-wearing, there&#8217;s no-Gook-like-a-dead-Gook, card-carrying, liberal-hating fascist&#8221;. I am not and never have been anti-American, but I am decidedly against Bush and his Washington weirdoes, who have steered their country to aggressive and needless confrontation with every country that does not accept servile subordination to the Bush doctrine of imperial supremacy.</p> \n\n<p>There was one main reason for moving from fascist to liberal, and that was the fact that Washington and London tell us lies and that these lies are accepted and resold by people who should know better. My reaction to the announcement that the British Parliament&#8217;s report concerning Blair&#8217;s exaggerations about Iraq&#8217;s weapons of mass destruction was going to be published was that it would be a whitewash, otherwise they wouldn&#8217;t publish it. Now that is unhealthy, knee-jerk cynicism, but I didn&#8217;t get this way without a lot of help.</p> \n\n<p>When PG Wodehouse wrote humorously about Hollywood he invented a genus called nodders. First there was the film company&#8217;s president, then legions of vice-presidents, then there were the nodders whose job it was to attend conferences and agree, by deferential head inclination, with everything that was said. Far too many reporters and legislators are nodders.</p> \n\n<p>Take, for example, the botched attack on some vehicles and the rocketing of a tiny smugglers&#8217; hamlet near the Iraq-Syrian border by a deeply secret bunch of US killers supported by aircraft armed with more firepower than a trio of tank squadrons. The affair was a ludicrous, ham-fisted stuff-up. They killed a young woman and her one year-old child, and wounded then took prisoner six Syrian border guards and held them for almost two weeks without explanation. The sheer arrogance of the latter action is staggering. (We won&#8217;t even discuss human rights and murdering Iraqi civilians; there&#8217;s no point.) The affair was almost as bizarre as the detention of a dozen Turkish soldiers in northern Iraq, about which we were told nothing, either. Nothing, that is, that we can believe.</p> \n\n<p>These operations, I remind you, took place in our name. It was for the safety of the world that Bush and Blair went to war on Iraq, so they say, and that is you and me. And if killings and cock-ups are committed in our name, then we want to know about it. The reason we are told nothing, or lied to with blatant contempt, is that the operations were bungled, therefore they don&#8217;t want us to know about them. The Bush cabal and the Blair government-within-a-government told us grotesque lies, before, during and after their war. We all know the device of &#8220;senior government source&#8221; and &#8220;senior administration official&#8221;, and those of us who have our own sources, here and there, know on many occasions exactly who these people are. It is time &#8211; it is more than time &#8211; that the media refused to publicise &#8216;information&#8217; unless the source can be named. (&#8216;Cabal&#8217; was the name given to a clique of devious ministers appointed by Charles II; their surnames begin with the letters of the word. What about Cheney, Rumsfeld, Ashcroft and Powell?)</p> \n\n<p>If the Bush and Blair ju-ju men want to give the world some facts, they should go on the record. Here is one example of needlessly unattributable nonsense, from the New York Times on July 7 : &#8220;Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a senior Defense Department official said the soldiers who stormed the Turkish compound in Sulaimaniya on Friday were &#8216;acting on intelligence about possible illicit activities that were being planned against municipal officials in the region.&#8217; A senior American military official, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed this account, saying the plot appeared to be aimed at the governor of Kirkuk, a nearby city.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>I don&#8217;t believe a word of it. Associated Press recorded that &#8220;Emel Begler, a Turkish cook who was among the detained together with her 15-year-old son, told reporters the US troops broke down the doors, placed sacks over their heads and handcuffed their hands behind their backs.&#8221; So she was plotting to kill the governor of Kirkuk, was she? Ratbane in his Freedom Fries, perhaps. But if the Turkish soldiers she cooked for were indeed plotting assassination, why were they then set free? What&#8217;s the real story?</p> \n\n<p>Why the anonymity in this and so many other cases? It appears to be a reflex action, like manacling and blindfolding male Iraqi civilians in order to humiliate them in front of their families. This sort of cave-man thug-stuff never used to happen. What is the point of it? All it does is feed the fires of fury against the US in Iraq, just as anonymous &#8212; cowardly, gutless, amoral &#8212; briefers exasperate and deceive us to the point that we don&#8217;t believe a damn word they say. Rumsfeld often insists he be described as a &#8220;senior defense official&#8221;, which is cowardice. If he&#8217;s got anything to say, let him be named as saying it. Creeping behind the shield of bureaucratic anonymity is the action of a lily-livered sleazebag. But the sycophantic nodders of the media hang on his every deceitful word.</p> \n\n<p>When you trawl the news sites on the Internet you can obtain a lot of accurate first-hand information from Reuters, AP, AFP and other reputable agencies, but when I see a story is sourced to Fox News or CNN I don&#8217;t even bring it up on the screen. After months of slewed and slanted rubbish from these unbelievably piffling, bimbo-ridden, nodder-outlets how could anyone trust them to give the right time of day?</p> \n\n<p>Do you remember the &#8220;defence department official&#8221; who told the Washington Post (which had a pretty iffy news source in one particularly well-embedded reporter) that Private Jessica Lynch had fought gamely to the last bullet and all that nonsense? She was injured, certainly &#8212; but in the shambles of a panic-stricken vehicle crash. The story about her &#8220;heroism&#8221; was fabrication. It was a downright damned lie. So who was the &#8220;official&#8221; who concocted this rubbish? He may have only briefly crawled out from beneath the large flat slimy stone under which he normally resides, but why was he not punished for telling us lies? Of course nothing of the sort will ever happen, and the reason for this is that the information system is rotten to its nodding core.</p> \n\n<p>The BBC, one of the last bastions of objectivity and truth, has been attacked by Blair&#8217;s scummy little ratbag mumbo-jumbo-meister, Alastair Campbell (&#8216;Calamity Ali&#8217;), for helping reveal that the Downing Street campaign to mislead the British public about reasons for the war on Iraq was largely successful. The outcome of the British parliamentary inquiry into this squalid affair was predictable, and not just by cynics like me. How on earth can one credit the results of an inquiry that was not allowed to interview the main liar (the prime minister), or have access to all classified reports? How could you believe a man like Blair, anyway, when he is on record, in a moment of political panic, as demanding his nodders think up some &#8220;eye-catching initiatives with which I personally can be associated&#8221;? Nothing that would benefit his country or its unfortunate citizens, you understand. Nothing of principle; just something that would look good. The man is a grubby charlatan.</p> \n\n<p>In any event the inquirers were a majority of nodder Labour MPs, and the committee&#8217;s clearing of Campbell for his shoddy behaviour was achieved by the chairman (a Blair man to his bootstraps) using his casting vote. This is nodder democracy. On no account would Blair permit an independent inquiry by a trio of impartial judges, with access to every detail of the affair. Such an inquiry would be, well, impartial, and that can&#8217;t be allowed, because we might learn the truth, presented to us by people we trust. And Blair and his people wonder why we don&#8217;t trust them. They couldn&#8217;t stretch out straight in bed; that&#8217;s why we don&#8217;t trust them.</p> \n\n<p>The same holds in the US. The Senate committee&#8217;s whitewash will be exactly the same as the Blair parliament&#8217;s lapdog performance, and there is no possibility that a Republican-dominated Congress could ever be critical of Bush, no matter how many lies he told. (Remember these repulsive lulus? : &#8220;Iraq possesses ballistic missiles with a likely range of hundreds of miles&#8221;; Iraq &#8220;has trained Al Qaeda in bomb making and poisons and deadly gases&#8221;; &#8220;a report came out of the IAEA that [Iraq was] six months away from developing a [nuclear] weapon&#8221;. All lies.)</p> \n\n<p>This is why I changed from Genghiz Khan mode. The people we should be able to trust have been lying outrageously to political and journalistic nodders, who happily passed the lies on to us without question and even with embellishment. If you fed them nails, they&#8217;d crap corkscrews. The hell with the lot of them.</p> \n\n<p>BRIAN CLOUGHLEY writes about defense issues for CounterPunch, Dawn and other international publications.

Anderson Cooper, a member of the LGBT Community, interviewed Florida AG and vehement opponent of LGBT rights, Pam Bondi. Today, she is promoting her valiant efforts to prevent fraud against the vulnerable victims and their families with illegitimate GoFundMe pages. It didn't take long for Cooper to remind Bondi of her record of opposing Marriage Equality. Let's revisit some of Bondi's anti-LGBT <a href=\"http://www.thenewcivilrightsmovement.com/davidbadash/attorney_general_pam_bondi_s_battle_against_same_sex_marriage_will_cost_florida_taxpayers_500_000\" type=\"external\">history:</a></p> \n\n<p>Florida's Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi was one of the most active and recognizable fighters against same-sex marriage in the run up to the Supreme Court taking up the issue. And now, Florida taxpayers will have to pay almost a half million dollars in legal fees to the winning attorneys, thanks entirely to Bondi's unyielding defense. NBC Miami reports the final figure is $493,000.</p> \n\n<p>Time after time after time Bondi lost in court, and time after time after time Bondi appealed. Bondi became a reviled figure for the anti-gay rhetoric in her court filings, which were deemed not only false but hypocritical, given she was on her third marriage.</p> \n\n<p>Here's some of the heated exchange:</p> \n\n<p>COOPER: I want to ask you - I saw you the other day saying that anyone who attacks the LGBT community, our LGBT community, you said, will be gone after with the full extent of the law.</p> \n\n<p>BONDI: That's exactly right.</p> \n\n<p>COOPER: I talked to a lot of gay and lesbian people here yesterday who are not fans of yours and who said that they thought you were being a hypocrite, that you for years have fought - you basically have gone after gay people, said that in court that gay people simply by fighting for marriage equality were trying to do harm to the people of Florida, to induce public harm I believe was the term you used in court. Do you really think you're a champion of the gay community?</p> \n\n<p>BONDI: I - let me tell you, I - when I was sworn in as attorney general, I put my hand on a Bible and was sworn to uphold the constitution of the state of Florida. That's not a law. That was voted in to our state constitution by the voters of Florida. That's what I was defending. Had nothing to do - I've never said I don't like gay people. That's ridiculous.</p> \n\n<p>COOPER: But you did say - but do you worry about using language accusing gay people of trying to do harm to the people of Florida -</p> \n\n<p>He continued to fluster Bondi, by simply reviewing her words and actions against equal rights for ALL PEOPLE. The final nail in her coffin came close to the end of the interview:</p> \n\n<p>COOPER: The - the hotline that you've been talking about on television, which allows family members and spouses of the dead to get information -</p> \n\n<p>BONDI: Yes</p> \n\n<p>.</p> \n\n<p>COOPER: Which is incredibly important, and I appreciate you talking about on the air, had there been no gay marriage, had there been no same-sex marriage, you do realize that spouses, there would be no spouses, that boyfriends and girlfriends of the dead would not be able to get information and would not be able probably to even visit in the hospital here.</p> \n\n<p>BONDI: Well, that's -</p> \n\n<p>And he goes in for the kill with a quick question.</p> \n\n<p>COOPER: Isn't there a sick irony in that?</p> \n\n<p>She tried to win the argument by saying that she was defending Florida's Constitution, but Cooper shut her down again.</p> \n\n<p>BONDI: I was defending the constitution of what over 69 percent of the voters put in the constitution.</p> \n\n<p>COOPER: Right. But the - you know, the courts, the federal courts said, that's not the constitution -</p> \n\n<p>He reminded her that she kept fighting the ruling and wouldn't stop until she could no longer appeal. She attempted to switch subjects to the human tragedy that brought them all to Orlando, but Anderson destroyed her attempt to cover up the truth about her homophobia, and that's all the viewers will remember. Just awesome!</p> \n\n<p>In case you weren't disgusted by this woman, she is also the very same Republican who just so happened to drop the investigation into Trump University after the Trump Foundation made a <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-u-scandal-gets-worse-floridas-ag\" type=\"external\">$25,000</a>contribution towards her re-election efforts.

The problems with Palo Alto's recent quarter range from increased spending to poor guidance and slowing revenue growth. And to make matters worse, it's a healthy dose of all three.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Despite landing on the wrong side of the earnings fence, Palo Alto responded positively in one of its primary initiatives: boosting its source of recurring revenue. However, as noted in a recent <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/05/25/3-things-to-watch-for-during-palo-alto-networks-in.aspx?source=eptfxblnk0000004\" type=\"external\">article Opens a New Window.</a> leading up to the May 26 announcement, Palo Alto investors' patience was only going to be tested for so long. At some point the company needs to perform beyond growing its top line, and it's running out of time.</p> \n\n<p>CEO Mark McLaughlin tried to temper expectations after reporting Palo Alto's second-quarter results by forecasting a 43% to 45% revenue improvement in Q3, ending its nearly two-year-long streak of reporting 50% or more quarterly sales growth. Palo Alto didn't quite reach the remarkable 50% revenue jump this past (fiscal third) quarter, but delivered a pleasantly surprising 48% gain, to $345.8 million. Analysts had expected sales of $339.48 million.</p> \n\n<p>On the earnings-per-share front, Palo Alto hit its high-end forecast of $0.42 on a non-GAAP (excluding one-time items) basis, which also matched pundits' expectations. Fiscal Q3 billings rose a whopping 61% last quarter, to $486.2 million, which would seemingly be a positive sign of what is to come in the current fiscal Q4. But it is not to be.</p> \n\n<p>If not reaching 50% revenue growth is partly to blame for Palo Alto's stock price nosedive, its forecast for the current quarter will be downright depressing. On the high end of McLaughlin's forecast, Palo Alto expects 37% revenue growth to end its fiscal year, or $390 million.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>On a more positive note, Palo Alto's services unit grew a whopping 63%, to $183.7 million, in Q3, and now represents 53% of total sales. Service sales, and the recurring revenue they generate, are a critical initiative for Palo Alto, and they took a step in the right direction last quarter.</p> \n\n<p>As noted before, Palo Alto has been on a spending spree for years to drive its stellar 50%-plus revenue jumps. But with growth beginning to slow -- Q3's results and this quarter's guidance are proof of that -- minimizing costs has become a necessity, not a nicety. The problem is, McLaughlin and team can't seem to keep their checkbooks in their pockets.</p> \n\n<p>A comparison with Palo Alto's peer and primary competitor,Check Point Software , demonstrates why the former's stock is down 26% year to date, and the latter's is up 3%. Palo Alto's total operating expenses of $309.5 million equaled 90% of sales. Check Point, on the other hand, spent 50% of last quarter's $404.3 million in revenue on its operating expenses.</p> \n\n<p>As for cost of revenue, Palo Alto spent $94.9 million to drive its product and services sales, more than twice Check Point Software's $45 million last quarter. Is it any wonder Check Point is profitable, on both a GAAP (including one-time items) and non-GAAP basis? And Check Point's profits continue to climb, too, rising 10% last quarter.</p> \n\n<p>Considering Palo Alto's slowing revenue growth and increased spending, it could be years before shareholders are in the black. Unfortunately, it gets worse because of the nature of Palo Alto's skyrocketing expenses. Check Point's sales and marketing costs equaled 23% of revenue in fiscal Q1, whereas Palo Alto's $202 million ate up a head-shaking 58% of its total sales last quarter.</p> \n\n<p>When investors add it all up, the answer is fairly straightforward: Slowing top-line growth was inevitable, but continuing to spend indiscriminately is not. Until McLaughlin reins in overheads, even improvement in services unit sales and the recurring revenue that comes with it won't be enough to placate shareholders. Nor should it be.</p> \n\n<p>The article <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/05/30/palo-alto-networks-inc-earnings-missed-where-it-ma.aspx\" type=\"external\">Palo Alto Networks Inc.

[The] less privileged, Negroes, Spanish-Americans, and poor whites, must fight a war in the name of principles such as freedom and equality of opportunity which their own nation has denied them.&#8221;&amp;#160; &#8220;Conscription,&#8221; they declared, has throughout American history &#8220;invariably been biased in favor of the wealthy and privileged.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Enter young Mitt Romney, right on cue, waving a sign denouncing the anti-war students.&amp;#160; &amp;#160;He, like his fellow almost all-male participants in this pro-war demonstration, fervently argued in support of the war and the draft.&amp;#160; But not, of course, for himself.</p> \n\n<p>When Mitt enrolled at Stanford back in the spring of 1965, the official and overt U.S. war (as distinct from the previous forms of proxy, clandestine, and &#8220;adviser&#8221; warfare waged in Vietnam for more than a decade) had just begun.&amp;#160; Operation Rolling Thunder, the sustained U.S. bombing of the north, had started on March 2.&amp;#160; The first officially acknowledged U.S. combat units were the Marines who went ashore at Da Nang on March 8 (joining the 24,000 U.S. military personnel already fighting in Vietnam).&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Draftees were not yet being used in combat.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; So Mitt and his dad clearly intended the fall of 1965 to be the beginning of a fine four-year career at Stanford for the young man.&amp;#160; But Mitt&#8217;s last month as a Stanford student was May 1966.&amp;#160; Why?</p> \n\n<p>Although the Selective Service Exam radically reduced the chances of college men, especially those with the test-taking skills of most Stanford students, to be conscripted into the Vietnam War, it was no guarantee of long-lasting deferment.&amp;#160; There were other, surer, escapes from the Vietnam nightmare.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; One of the very best was the ministry.&amp;#160; In 1966, young men flooded into divinity schools, embarking on careers to be ministers, priests, and rabbis.&amp;#160; The Mormons had an even better deal than most religions, because The Church of Latter-Day Saints required each and every one of its young men to become, for at least two years, a &#8220;minister of religion.&#8221;&amp;#160; &amp;#160;Thus all Mormon young men could claim deferments as ministers.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; When the inequity of this arrangement became too blatant, the Selective Service entered into an agreement with the LDS that required the church to specify just one &#8220;minister&#8221; for each geographical district.&amp;#160; Since there were relatively few Mormons in Michigan, and Governor George Romney had considerable influence in the church, Mitt quickly received an official appointment as a Mormon &#8220;minister of religion,&#8221; consecrated by a draft deferment from the Selective Service. &amp;#160;So instead of returning to Stanford, Mitt went off to become a Mormon missionary in France, where he would spend the next two and a half years&#8212;while Vietnam became a slaughterhouse for the Vietnamese and many Americans drafted to slaughter them.</p> \n\n<p>So who says that Mitt Romney is inconsistent?&amp;#160; After all, what may have been his first recorded public political act was supporting the draft for ordinary Americans, forcing them to participate in a war waged in the interest of his own class.</p> \n\n<p>H.

Here's why.</p> \n\n<p>Intel's revised financial guidance for the quarter called for $15.6 billion in revenue -- representing the midpoint of the range that Intel provided -- thanks to an uptick in sales of chips that go into personal computers. Intel actually delivered $15.8 billion in revenue, handily beating the midpoint of its revised guidance and analyst consensus of $15.58 billion.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>So why is the stock taking a drubbing if it actually beat analyst estimates?</p> \n\n<p>Analysts were expecting Intel to guide to revenue of around $15.86 billion for the fourth quarter of the year; Intel guided to $15.7 billion -- missing expectations, albeit slightly. Investors often place greater value on future performance and less on past performance, which is probably a large reason the stock is selling off.</p> \n\n<p>However, the problems run a little bit deeper than a headline guidance miss; there was a pretty significant red flag in the company's earnings report -- particularly in its results for its highly important data center group business. (If you're unfamiliar with why this segment is so important to Intel and its investors, read <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/10/13/intel-corporations-data-center-business-3-things-i.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">this Opens a New Window.</a>.)</p> \n\n<p>During the first half of the year, Intel's data center business delivered disappointing revenue growth relative to its long-term 15% compounded annual growth rate guidance and even its full-year guidance of low-double-digit percentage growth -- 9% in the first quarter and just 5% in the second quarter.</p> \n\n<p>Despite those lackluster results in the first half of 2016, Intel management insisted that it could still hit its double-digit growth target for the year as a result of a significant reacceleration during the second half of the year. Intel's data center group achieved just 10% year-over-year growth in the third quarter and, unsurprisingly, guided down full-year expectations to just \"high-single-digit growth.\"</p> \n\n<p>Although the better-than-expected results in the company's personal computer chip business helped to bolster the quarterly results -- even the \"worse than expected\" fourth-quarter guidance still represents a healthy number -- investors are very sensitive to the performance of the company's data center group.</p> \n\n<p>Remember, Intel and many investors have basically written off hopes of ever seeing its PC business as a \"growth\" business again -- it's a large cash cow that's going to milked for every last dollar of operating profit that it can reasonably produce.</p> \n\n<p>The data center group, on the other hand, represents the company's best hope over the long term at sustainable growth, since the markets it serves are generally growing. If this shows signs of faltering, then Intel's growth prospects may appear dimmer -- leading to a lower share price.</p> \n\n<p>Although the headline results might seem bad, things look better when one takes a look under the covers. The bulk of Intel's data center group revenue comes from the sale of processors, and according to the company's 2015 investor meeting, those processor sales can be broken down into three major categories:</p> \n\n<p>Intel's prior forecast called for each of these segments to represent roughly a third of the processor revenue that its data center group generates in 2016.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Intel.</p> \n\n<p>According to Intel, although the second two categories performed well -- and they're generally viewed as the healthy and growing sub-segments of Intel's data center business -- the enterprise server portion of its business came in worse than expected. Intel says it was looking for enterprise-related revenue to be roughly flat, but it wound up declining about 3% in the quarter.</p> \n\n<p>The good news here is that the sub-segments that have historically been growing are still growing, so it's not as though these results cast doubt over the long-term trends that this business is expected to benefit from. It just so happens that one generally problematic and disappointing sub-segment was a little more problematic and disappointing than is usually the case.</p> \n\n<p>So although the data center results were disappointing, they're hardly cause to freak out over. If you liked Intel's long-term prospects before the earnings report, then this one \"miss\" really shouldn't change that fundamental view.</p> \n\n<p>A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Because he sees a world in need of the Gospel, and of friendship with Jesus Christ, as an antidote to the self-absorption and loneliness that are eating away at the solidarity of the human community. Because, in the Vatican, &amp;#160;if you don&#8217;t get something new done quickly you may not get it done at all. Because he&#8217;s 78 years old and knows that his will be a short pontificate.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: You&#8217;ve written that he has &#8220;reanimated the papacy.&#8221; What does that mean for Church teaching?</p> \n\n<p>GW: I hope it means that the new interest in the pope evokes a new interest in the Church&#8217;s teaching, of which the pope is the custodian. Francis ought to be taken at his word when he says, as he has often done, that he is a son of the Church who believes and teaches what the Catholic Church believes and teaches. If his media-generated popularity, fragile as that may turn out to be when the world discovers that the pope is really a Catholic, opens windows of possibility for explaining that divine mercy leads us to the truths God revealed to us (and inscribed into the world and into us), then his reanimation of the papacy will advance the &#8220;Church in permanent mission&#8221; for which he called in&amp;#160;Evangelii Gaudium, which is the grand strategy document of his pontificate.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: In that same article for the Tablet, a British magazine, you said, &#8220;All over the world, Francis is news, and when the Pope is news, so is the Church and the Gospel.&#8221; Is that still good news when the pope seems to be interpreted in different ways by different people? When the Gospel seems to be interpreted in different ways by different people?</p> \n\n<p>GW: That&#8217;s the obvious challenge, perhaps even danger, here. By its very nature as a custodial office, the papacy can&#8217;t be a Rorschach test, into which people read whatever they like &#8211; whatever they fear or hope for. So when media &#8220;narratives&#8221; about Francis get set in concrete, and act as filters bending or distorting (or ignoring) aspects of his vision and his teaching that don&#8217;t fit the established story line, the Church has a problem. There&#8217;s an obvious investment in some media circles in the &#8220;narrative&#8221; of &#8220;the pope who&#8217;s finally going to get with it.&#8221; And as a friend at a major American newspaper said to me when I complained about this tendency in his own paper, &#8220;You know how these media narratives are. They&#8217;re like bamboo.&#8221; Meaning, once they start growing, you can&#8217;t kill them.</p> \n\n<p>Perhaps the dumbest of these story lines is that Francis has re-opened conversation and debate in a Church that had been closed and claustrophobic for 35 years under John Paul II and Benedict XVI. I defy anyone who, over the last 35 years, has spent time on the campuses of Notre Dame or Georgetown, or who has read the National Catholic Reporter, or who has gone to a meeting of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious, to make that claim without experiencing a twinge of conscience that says, &#8220;I should wash my mouth out with soap.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The most enduring of the false narratives is that the signature phrase of the early pontificate &#8212; &#8220;Who am I to judge?&#8221; &#8212; was a matter of the pope jettisoning millennia of Catholic moral teaching. It was not. It was a specific response to the circumstances of a man who had repented and was trying to live an upright life; it was, in a word, what any sensible pastor, facing that specific set of circumstances, would say. But ripped out of context, it has become an all-purpose filter through which everything else &#8212; including the pope&#8217;s multiple reaffirmations of Humanae Vitae, Paul VI&#8217;s encyclical on the morally appropriate means of family planning &#8212; gets airbrushed out of the picture.</p> \n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s the trope about an impending &#8220;global-warming encyclical.&#8221; The pope is preparing an encyclical on nature and the environment, including the human environment (which includes the moral imperative of a culturally affirmed and legally recognized right to life from conception until natural death). So what happens? A low-ranking Vatican official with gauchiste tendencies and a marked talent for self-promotion gives an interview to the Guardian, one of the most consistently anti-Catholic newspapers in the world, in which he claims that this is a global-warming encyclical &#8212; which he couldn&#8217;t possibly have known, as the document wasn&#8217;t drafted yet. The Guardian loves it, because it fits the story line of the long-awaited Great Catholic Cave-In. So the story wafts across the Atlantic, where it&#8217;s picked up with glee by Catholic progressives and horror by some Catholic conservatives &#8212; and the battle of the blogs is on, full blast. No one bothers to ask whether there&#8217;s any basis in fact for the assertion that this is going to be a &#8220;global-warming encyclical.&#8221; So when climate change gets some attention in a 100-page document, the most important parts of which will have to do with the theology of stewardship and the theology of &#8220;human ecology,&#8221; it&#8217;s almost certainly going to be rapturously embraced, or bitterly opposed, as a &#8220;global-warming encyclical,&#8221; despite the evidence that it&#8217;s much more broadly gauged than that.</p> \n\n<p>More pro-active Vatican communications might be able to do something about all this, but when the Holy See is constantly in the mode of, &#8220;No, what the pope really meant was . . . ,&#8221; the game has already been largely forfeited.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: What is it that is so powerful about Pope Francis&#8217;s example? His gestures?</p> \n\n<p>GW: The world needs a pastor, whether it knows it or not. And Francis communicates the pastoral embrace of the Church, the breadth and inclusiveness of Catholicism symbolized by the Bernini colonnade around St. Peter&#8217;s Square, in a powerful way. What is amazing here is that he started doing this at age 76; there was none of it in Buenos Aires, as least on a vast scale. So here&#8217;s a contrast to John Paul II, who was an immensely attractive public figure in Cracow and then brought that capacity to inspire-by-example to Rome &#8212; although some of the narrative-merchants seem to have forgotten that.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: What is it about the missionary mandate of the Church that modern-day Catholics miss in the West?</p> \n\n<p>GW: We&#8217;re used to institutional-maintenance Catholicism, in which the institution ticks along by its own inertia and people are &#8220;born&#8221; into the Church. Francis knows that is over and done with: &#8220;Kept&#8221; Catholicism, whether &#8220;kept&#8221; by legal establishment or by cultural habit, has no future. The only future is intentional Catholicism, evangelical Catholicism. That&#8217;s what he and the other bishops of Latin America proclaimed at their Aparecida meeting in Brazil in 2007.&amp;#160; And that&#8217;s what the liveliest parts of the world Church today &#8212; ranging from the booming Church in Africa to FOCUS missionaries on American campuses &#8212; are living: a Catholicism that has discovered that it doesn&#8217;t have a mission, it is a mission. The people who are behind the curve of the Catholic future are the institutional-maintenance types. The Germans now seem the primary example of this &#8212; which is another reason to scratch the head at their seeming determination to force the whole Church to adopt the Catholic Lite approach that has, in a bizarre inversion, emptied German churches of congregants while vastly expanding the German Church&#8217;s bureaucracies.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: All this focus Francis has put on family, and all the debates he has seemed to encourage, what is that about? Where do we wind up? Is there a danger in the risks he seems to have taken?</p> \n\n<p>GW: The pope knows that the marriage culture is in crisis throughout the world, and so is the family. He comes to that conviction as a pastor, not as Brad Wilcox or Charles Murray. So he wants to challenge the Church to find pastoral responses to that crisis that meet real human needs. The turmoil of the Synod last October was in large part the result of the Synod&#8217;s being hijacked by a small cabal of northern-European bishops, determined to make the entire exercise a referendum on some things the rest of the Church already considers settled: the permanence of marriage and the conditions for receiving Holy Communion worthily. I think the Synod of October 2015 is going to get back to that broader agenda &#8212; at least I hope it does, and I&#8217;ve reason to believe that there are many bishops determined that that will be the case.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: What do you say to conservative friends who are nervous &#8212; or disappointed, or dismissive, or livid, or heartbroken &#8212; about the pope?</p> \n\n<p>GW: &#8220;You don&#8217;t believe what you read in the papers about anything else; why do you believe it about the pope?&#8221; That&#8217;s where I&#8217;d start.</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;d then suggest that these people, if they&#8217;re Americans, look back on the last 35 years of our ecclesial experience and take heart from that. The dramatic reform of seminaries continues. The priests and bishops who take their pastoral model from John Paul II will continue to do so, perhaps learning a lesson or two from Francis along the way &#8212; and they&#8217;ll be the overwhelming majority of the Church&#8217;s ordained ministers ten, twenty, thirty years from now. The dynamically orthodox orders of religious women will continue to grow, and the dying orders, which long ago opted for the lightest of Catholic Lite, will continue to die. Younger theologians will continue to pursue and understand truth rather than deconstructing it, as a lot of their elders seemed to want to do. Vital parishes built on the Bible and the sacraments, committed to evangelizing their neighborhoods, will continue to flourish. The poor will be served, the sick healed, and the dying comforted. None of that is going to change, and I&#8217;d wager that it&#8217;s going to get better. The Church in the United States turned a corner about three decades ago, and the idea that we&#8217;re going back to the incoherence of the late Sixties and Seventies is, frankly, silly. Let&#8217;s have a little faith in what the Holy Spirit has done among us these past 35 years.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: What do you say to liberals who warn Francis (like that Rolling Stone cover a year or so ago) that he&#8217;d better not be like Benedict, that he&#8217;d better be the pope of their ideological hopes and dreams?</p> \n\n<p>GW: That anyone would imagine finding insight in a Rolling Stone article on a pope, be he Francis, Benedict XVI, Agapitus I, or Leo the Great, is beyond my comprehension; it would be like seeking the inside scoop on the rock scene inForeign Affairs. What I hope my liberal friends (and I have more than a few) take from this pontificate is that mercy and truth are never separable in Catholic pastoral life. The Church offers the medicine of the divine mercy so that healed souls can grasp the truth that will liberate them in the fullest meaning of human freedom. I&#8217;d also hope that my liberal friends, who find in this pope a critic of what they&#8217;re pleased to call &#8220;culture-warrior&#8221; Catholics, will read carefully, and ponder even more carefully, what Pope Francis had to say about the &#8220;ideological colonization&#8221; implicit in Western decadence when he was giving robust pro-life, pro-family talks in the Philippines earlier this year. (In fact, the nervous conservatives should read those texts, too.)</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: Is there any shot at cleansing some of the ideology that&#8217;s crept into Church circles and getting back to something more sacramental?</p> \n\n<p>GW: That&#8217;s happening all the time in the best parishes in the Church, where the transformative power of the Eucharist is experienced through the dignified celebration of Holy Mass, and people are empowered for mission because of that.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: Why are people responding to him so favorably? He blows Pew polls off the charts. Is there a real impact he&#8217;s making?</p> \n\n<p>GW: The impact remains to be seen; I don&#8217;t think we can measure the enduring impact of John Paul II, for example, for another hundred, perhaps two hundred, years. The short-term impact is that people are encouraged to give the Church another look. It&#8217;s up to the liveliest parts of the Church &#8212; the dynamically orthodox parts of the Church &#8212; to seize that opportunity.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: What is the &#8220;encounter&#8221; he talks about? What are the &#8220;peripheries&#8221;?</p> \n\n<p>GW: Again, the pope takes his vocabulary from his pastoral experience, not from the rhetorical tool kit of liberation theology, with its Marxist yammering about &#8220;center&#8221; and &#8220;periphery.&#8221; The &#8220;peripheries,&#8221; for Francis, are all those who have fallen through the cracks of late-modernity and post-modernity &#8212; in his native Argentina, because of colossal corruption, political and financial. The pope speaks with great passion about the shame we should all feel when, as he puts it, &#8220;a man does not have the dignity of earning bread for his family,&#8221; but is turned into a peripheral person, a welfare client, a dependent. The &#8220;encounter&#8221; with the people on the peripheries is intended to draw them into the circle of common care and concern &#8212; that call to encounter is, to use a favorite world of John Paul II&#8217;s, a call to solidarity. And that means, it seems to me, aggressive Catholic efforts to empower the poor &#8212; and a profound Catholic challenge to all those cultural forces that are eroding stable families, which are the elementary schools where we learn to take responsibility for our lives, which is the highest exercise of freedom.</p> \n\n<p>The emphasis on the &#8220;peripheries&#8221; is also a distinctively &#8220;Franciscan&#8221; way of expressing the pope&#8217;s respect for untutored popular piety &#8212; a respect, I might add, that was shared by St. John Paul II. No one who reads and reveres the New Testament should doubt for a second that the pious poor and marginalized have something to teach all of us &#8212; including German theologian-bishops &#8212; about the truth of the Gospel and the mysteries of the Kingdom of God.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: What have your conversations with him been like?</p> \n\n<p>GW: Robust, quite candid, occasionally whimsical, very friendly; everything&#8217;s on the table.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: Has the Vatican changed on account of him? What does the future hold?</p> \n\n<p>GW: The most important appointment Pope Francis has made is the appointment of the Australian cardinal, George Pell, as the Vatican&#8217;s financial overseer. The colossal mess in Vatican finances that Francis inherited two years ago has been cleaned up, and cleaned out. Real budgeting and accounting procedures are in place; so are real professionals, not somebody&#8217;s nephew. The job now is to institutionalize all of that, and I wouldn&#8217;t bet against Cardinal Pell, who hasn&#8217;t shied away from contact sports since his days as an Australian-rules football star.</p> \n\n<p>It would seem that the rest of the re-design of the Roman Curia is not going nearly as well. And the contrast between these two realities, two years on, underscores a point I learned long ago about the papacy: One of the most important qualities in a pope is his judgment of people &#8212; can he get around him the people who can put into practice his vision of what the Church must be doing now to fulfill its mandate from the Lord?</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: Who is Jesus Christ to Pope Francis?</p> \n\n<p>GW: The Lord with whom he speaks for hours every day in prayer. The Risen One who reached out, touched his life, and called him into mission.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: What&#8217;s the most constructive Catholic response to him?</p> \n\n<p>GW: The papacy is an impossible job. So the best thing Catholics can do for the pope is to pray for him.</p> \n\n<p>Then they owe him the loyalty that is expressed in speaking the truth to him &#8212; and that puts a premium on knowing whether what you&#8217;re happy about, on unhappy about, has a basis in fact, or is merely a reflection of the &#8220;narrative.&#8221; By the same token, the new and stringent Ultramontanism on the Catholic Left &#8212; in which even the mildest questions about how things are working in this pontificate are denounced as treasonous disloyalty &#8212; is an affront to the open conversation for which the pope has called.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>KJL: What is his visit to the United States going to mean for the Church here?</p> \n\n<p>GW: For us, it&#8217;s going to be a great gathering of the vast and multifaceted Catholic family. For him, it&#8217;s an opportunity to experience the vitality of Catholicism in America, which, despite all its problems, is the best embodiment of his &#8220;Church in permanent mission&#8221; in the developed world.</p> \n\n<p>&#8212; Kathryn Jean Lopez is senior fellow at the&amp;#160;National Review Institute, editor-at-large of&amp;#160;National Review Online, and founding director of&amp;#160;Catholic Voices USA.

He first appeared on the Virginia scene in 1948 when, at age 25, he was the energetic new pastor of the First Baptist Church of Annandale. It was the beginning of a love affair with that wild, reckless and growing child known as Northern Virginia.</p> \n\n<p>It also was the beginning of a more important love life. Just two weeks before beginning his Annandale pastorate, Cumbie married Catherine &#8220;Kay&#8221; Inscoe and the couple honeymooned in Colonial Williamsburg, declaring that they loved each other and Virginia.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Bill Cumbie</p> \n\n<p>The '50s and '60s were exciting years of church growth, denominational development and, for the Cumbies, family building. In fairly close succession, the couple had four children: Elizabeth, James, Rebecca and Judith. The Annandale church occupied the young man's energy and he helped it grow from a core group of about 75 to a membership of over 700. He led the church in building programs. He developed a quick step and learned every back road from Alexandria to Vienna, visiting his far-flung congregation and developing long-lasting relationships among those in other churches.</p> \n\n<p>In 1952 Bill Cumbie was present at Columbia Baptist Church for the organizational meeting of the new Mount Vernon Baptist Association, which included 25 churches out of the old Potomac Association. In 1956-57 Cumbie served so effectively as moderator of the Mount Vernon that one pastor remarked that he had never seen a better, more efficient district association moderator. The same man predicted that &#8220;this young pastor will be heard from in the future in larger Baptist councils in Virginia and our Southland.&#8221; It was a prophetic statement.</p> \n\n<p>In 1957, the association was ready to appoint a full-time superintendent of missions, a title which changed over the years to executive director. At age 34, Cumbie was elected as the association's first executive and he steamed ahead with all the gusto of youth. For the next 30 years, until his retirement in 1988, he led the day-to-day work of the Mount Vernon, rallying leaders in the member churches, building staff and programs and planting the Baptist banner all across the burgeoning metro Washington area. He was not satisfied even when the Mount Vernon became one of the undisputed models for associationalism in the nation. He always pushed for something more, something better.</p> \n\n<p>Cumbie became active in every phase of Baptist life. He was involved in the professional organization for SBC &#8220;DOMs&#8221; (directors of missions, as they were known). He served on the board of trustees of his alma mater, Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas. He was an unpaid assistant to the chief leader of the Baptist World Alliance and never missed a BWA Congress. And he embraced the Baptist General Association of Virginia as if he were one of Virginia's native sons.</p> \n\n<p>He studied Virginia Baptist history. When someone mentioned Editor R.H. Pitt's classic address, &#8220;The Virginia Baptist Temper and Tradition,&#8221; Cumbie laughed that he had read the address in its full original text, noting the omissions in later printed copies. He chaired the General Association's 150th anniversary committee. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Richmond and claimed it as proudly as he did his earned degree from Baylor University. He learned the politics of the General Association. He understood the intricacies of its framework and organization. In 1975-76 he achieved &#8220;the highlight&#8221; of his life with election to the office of president. He was the first director of missions to serve as president of a state convention.</p> \n\n<p>Bill Cumbie early discovered that to master public meetings it was necessary to master parliamentary law. He served as parliamentarian of SBC meetings and frequently for the BGAV. In 1985 he openly criticized Charles Stanley's &#8220;flagrant misuse&#8221; of parliamentary procedure at the pivotal SBC meeting in Dallas.</p> \n\n<p>Whenever as a messenger to a BGAV meeting, Cumbie rose to a microphone during a business session, a hush fell over the room and all ears listened. Seasoned messengers would punch newcomers and whisper for them to listen up. And Cumbie was always right on target with his objections and observations. Wags wondered if the man from Mount Vernon slept with the BGAV constitution and bylaws as well as with Robert's Rules!</p> \n\n<p>Bill Cumbie was feisty, determined and hopeful. His personality was shaped by nine years in an orphanage in Macon, Ga., and by gentle folks at the First Baptist Church of Macon.</p> \n\n<p>At 10, he accepted Christ and was baptized. Two years later, the orphanage's superintendent expressed the hope that one day Billie might become its first preacher. The boy was only 12 but he already knew that the pulpit was his destination. As &#8220;DOM&#8221; for Mount Vernon, over a 30-year period, he averaged preaching somewhere every other day (not every other Sunday but every other day). And he possessed a power and skill in the pulpit which enabled him to reach any type of congregation.</p> \n\n<p>In order to accomplish so much, he had to be master of himself and slave to a clock. He once admonished this columnist that every person has equality in one thing: everyone has the same 24 hours within a single day. It mattered how you organized and prioritized and &#8220;I haven't got time&#8221; was not a valid excuse.</p> \n\n<p>Bill Cumbie suffered no fools. He was never bashful about buttonholing someone, jabbing his pointed finger into the air or into someone's chest, and holding forth when truth as he perceived it was misrepresented. People&#8212;friends, colleagues and even opponents&#8212;listened because ultimately they respected him. They understood that the man from Mount Vernon knew whatever he was talking about and that he cared passionately about the subject and, even more, about them.</p> \n\n<p>He died on Feb. 19 at age 83; and when Virginia Baptists gather again, the man from Mount Vernon will be missed.</p>", "title": "The man from Mount Vernon", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://baptistnews.com/article/themanfrommountvernon/", "published_at": "", "bias": 3}, {"text": "<p>.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........</p> \n\n<p>Romea (handout photo)</p> \n\n<p>BELEN &#8211; The Rev.

John Daniel of the Archdiocese of Santa Fe, who said that &#8220;in an investigation conducted by the church &#8230; Father Romea had stated that after services he had talked to a juvenile female, and had kissed her forehead and then he told her that he liked her pictures on Facebook. The juvenile, not yet listed, was reported as saying that Father Romea had kissed her on the cheek, and then told her that he had seen her pictures on Facebook and that he wanted to see more pictures of her in shorts,&#8221; according to the report.</p> \n\n<p>Belen Police Chief Scott Conner said he instructed his detectives to make contact with the church and archdiocese, and they were cooperative.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;They did a little digging around and it looks like it&#8217;s going to be more an inappropriate conduct by a member of the clergy than a criminal act,&#8221; Conner said in a phone interview.</p> \n\n<p>Conner said the alleged victim is an 18-year-old girl who is a Belen High School student and detectives found no need for further investigation because they believe no criminal act occurred.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;As with any case, that could change depending on any new information we receive,&#8221; the chief said.</p> \n\n<p>The report noted that no other comments were made and that no other juveniles had reported any misconduct from Romea.</p> \n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Romea has been at the center of alleged inappropriate conduct while at Our Lady of Belen.

The president said his team is doing \"everything we can possibly do to get the websites functioning faster,\" and said there's no excuse for the problems users have experienced.</p> \n\n<p>\"Everybody who wants insurance through the marketplace will get insurance. Period,\" the president said.</p> \n\n<p>From the beginning, those wanting to sign-up for insurance via the Affordable Care Act&#8217;s marketplace experienced a host of problems including even just accessing the site&amp;#160; and even fewer people were actually able to register for a policy they wanted on the first few days the site was live.</p> \n\n<p>In addition, some of those who were able to successfully logon, create an account, and select a policy also ran into glitches that caused them to sign up for more than one insurance plan, or send incomplete data to insurance companies from the new enrollees, according to several reports.</p> \n\n<p>Because of the unsuccessful rollout of the ACA&#8217;s registration site, the Obama administration has been heavily criticized for not testing the operation more adequately before it was made available to the American public. The ACA was also under the intense spotlight of the recent government shutdown and debt ceiling debate in Washington following the site&#8217;s launch.

Waged battle to make sure millions of Americans have same chance to get same security as everybody else. That is what this is about.

After one not-so-successful attempt at cajoling publishers to post their news stories directly to the social network, the company hasreportedly tweaked its offering enough to appease bigger publishers testing out the updated Instant Articles platform. And now it has plans to extend its reach into news much further, bringing aboard other online news publishers and bloggers starting this spring, when it will open Instant Articles to all publishers.</p> \n\n<p>The latest move has the chance to help Facebook in two ways:</p> \n\n<p>Facebook has been trying to get its Instant Articles platform off the ground since last May. Its initial rollout with some publishers last year, however, didn't go over very well. Those who tested out the platform found that it wasn't delivering the kind of ad revenue that would make it advantageous for them to publish articles directly to the social network rather than publish to their own sites and use social to guide readers to the content.</p> \n\n<p>Round 2 has gone better Facebook took a step back later last year and made changes in hopes of easing some of the news publishers' concerns. It now offers the publishers 70% of the revenue generated on the Facebook-procured ads on their Instant Articles and 100% of the revenue of any ads they procure themselves.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Image source: instantarticles.fb.com.</p> \n\n<p>It also loosened up restrictions on how many ads the publishers could place on each article page. Facebook, understandably worried about diminishing its users' experience, had initially set ad limits that publishers testing the pages found too restrictive to make the type of money necessary to consider staying on board.</p> \n\n<p>Those changes were apparently enough to satisfy some very popular publishers. Several <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-instant-articles-advertising-fixes-win-over-publishers-1455218551\" type=\"external\">spoke recently to The Wall Street Journal Opens a New Window.</a>, including Business Insider, Vox, and Mic, all major players in online news with varied audiences. Each had good things to say about their ability to generate revenue through the platform, and through the use of the ads procured through the Facebook Audience Network.</p> \n\n<p>Bringing Instant Articles to smaller publishersSoon after that WSJ report, Facebook announced plans to extend Instant Articles to all Web publishers. The company is no doubt comfortable with what it heard back after the tweaks and is ready for a major expansion to the platform, which is expected to come sometime after the F8 Facebook Developer Conference in April.</p> \n\n<p>The move to post content through Instant Articles will not be not an easy one for many news publishers. It has the potential to offer a healthy source of digital ad revenue, which can be frustratingly elusive for companies that don't deal in the type of big data that Facebook and Alphabet do. It also offers the potential of a much greater reach, with the ability to share content with friends an important component in delivery.</p> \n\n<p>But publishers have to reckon with a downside, too. Publishing directly to Facebook's platform has the potential to further commoditize the news content they deal in, siphoning off even more of their brands' strength over time.</p> \n\n<p>On top of that, it creates the potential for the publications to become increasingly more reliant on Facebook for their digital traffic -- and digital ad revenue. That's not a problem as long as the rules are working in their favor, but if Facebook were to change these rules, the publishers could be in a much weaker bargaining position than they were when they demanded better terms from Facebook last year.</p> \n\n<p>Maybe not a \"win-win,\" but it could be mutually beneficialBut it's not as if they were in a strong position to start with, either. Generating digital ad revenue has been difficult for many publishers. If Facebook's platform offers them the ability to generate as much or more revenue than they can from the same story on their own site, we should expect them to continue publishing directly to Facebook.</p> \n\n<p>For that reason, it made good sense for Facebook to have sweetened the pot enough to get them to stick around. While it's sharing a bigger portion of its ad revenue now, the long-term gains would seem to go to the social network.</p> \n\n<p>The article <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/09/good-news-in-facebooks-drive-to-win-over-publisher.aspx\" type=\"external\">Good News in Facebook's Drive to Win Over Publishers Opens a New Window.</a> originally appeared on Fool.com.</p> \n\n<p>Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. <a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/jekoslosky/info.aspx?source=eptfxblnk0000004\" type=\"external\">John-Erik Koslosky Opens a New Window.</a> owns shares of GOOGL. and FB.

The Canadians can clinch top spot with a win in their preliminary round finale against Denmark (0-3) on Saturday.</p> \n\n<p>In the only other tournament game, St. Louis Blues draft pick Klim Kostin scored twice in leading Russia (2-1) to a 5-2 win over Belarus (0-3). Russia clinched a Group B berth in the quarterfinal round Tuesday. Belarus closes the preliminary round against the Czech Republic on Saturday and is in jeopardy of finishing last in five-team Group B standings.</p> \n\n<p>Bellows scored on the Americans' first shootout chance by snapping a shot through Hart's legs. Then Tkachuk scored by firing a shot in the top right corner.</p> \n\n<p>Down 3-1, Perunovich cut the lead to 3-2 from the slot by capping a give-and-go passing play with Mittelstadt with 13:51 left. Mittlestadt, the Buffalo Sabres' first-round pick, then set up Tkachuk in front for the tying goal by gathering a loose puck behind the net after Canadian defenseman Kale Clague lost his stick.</p> \n\n<p>The Americans drew upon last year's win over Canada, in which they trailed 4-2.</p> \n\n<p>\"Just believing you're never out of the game. We had a lot of hockey left to be played,\" U.S. defenseman Adam Fox said. \"Last year, it was a very similar thing. Some guys who are returning had that experience to tell guys this year that, 'You know, we're not down and out.'\"</p> \n\n<p>It was a familiar feeling of disappointment for Canada.</p> \n\n<p>\"Yeah, it's a tough pill to swallow once again losing to the Americans in the shootout,\" forward Michael McLeod said. \"The only good thing is that this is round robin.\"</p> \n\n<p>The crowd on Friday appeared evenly split with American and Canadian fans, many of whom spent much of the game standing. As night fell, a red glow emanated from the middle section of the stadium, where rows of heaters hang above the seats.</p> \n\n<p>Flurries began falling during the pre-game national anthems, and the snow fell harder as the game progressed. It began falling so heavily that the surface had to be shoveled at each commercial break starting late in the second period. Work crews filled several wheelbarrows full of snow, which were dumped onto a pile that grew to about seven feet behind the east end of the rink.</p> \n\n<p>Oettinger had an opportunity to take time to enjoy the atmosphere.</p> \n\n<p>\"Yeah, I did see the shirtless guy on the Jumbotron. Yeah, I took a look a couple of times,\" Oettinger said with a smile. \"A really fun win, but now we've got to put it behind us.\"</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Eds: This story has been corrected to show this was international hockey's first outdoor game at a junior world championships.</p>", "title": "US rallies to 4-3 shootout win over Canada in outdoor game", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://apnews.com/amp/0cc5be91591d4cfaa850e50ff0ec2e31", "published_at": "2017-12-30", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>When Pojoaque High volleyball coach Brian Ainsworth decided to take the head coaching post for the Storm a couple years ago, after winning titles there in 2006, plus 2009-11, he &#8212; of course &#8212; brought along his daughter Briana, who&#8217;d merely been the two-time &#8220;Player of the Year&#8221; in Class 3A as the setter for the champion Elkettes.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s worked out well for both of them so far: The Storm have been to the last two state championship matches with the Ainsworths.</p> \n\n<p>Briana Ainsworth.</p> \n\n<p>When the Storm won it all in 2012, it was the third championship in a row for Briana.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the latest in the Observer&#8217;s Sunday features spotlighting talented senior student-athletes at both of the city&#8217;s high schools:</p> \n\n<p>When did you realize you were good enough to play this game? I realized I was good enough to play this game when I was in eighth grade and got moved up to play varsity. This forced me to mature as a player and set goals for myself. This year was a great start off to my high school season. My team and I won a state title as well as myself getting an award of Player of the Year. Outside of high school, I started receiving college letters and as an eighth-grader, this was pretty awesome. This gave me the desire to work harder to improve in any way I could.</p> \n\n<p>What&#8217;s been your most memorable moment on the court? My most memorable moment was my eighth-grade year, after they announced that we were state champions and my dad walked up to me with open arms, crying, and told me that I was awesome and he was proud of me. (And my dad never cries.)</p> \n\n<p>What&#8217;s the best advice you&#8217;ve ever received? &#8220;Play every game like it&#8217;s your last,&#8221; because in every sport there&#8217;s a chance of getting hurt, and once high school and college is over, there&#8217;s a chance you&#8217;ll never step foot on the court again. So live in the moment and make a difference when you play.</p> \n\n<p>What will you be doing at this time next year? This time next year I hope to be playing volleyball in college; however, I still have not decided where I want to go. As far as academically, I plan on going into the medical field.</p> \n\n<p>Where do you see yourself 10 years from now? Ten years from now I see myself working in the medical field. I would love to live somewhere outside of New Mexico to be able to experience different places.</p> \n\n<p>Who&#8217;s your favorite professional athlete? My favorite professional athlete is Misty May- Treanor. I look up to her because even though she&#8217;s short she&#8217;s so determined to be the best. I&#8217;ve been told a lot that I&#8217;m too short to play front row at a top college, which makes me work harder to prove people wrong.</p> \n\n<p>Name three people, dead or alive, you&#8217;d like to have dinner with: I would like to have dinner with Taylor Swift, my grandpa that died, and Misty May Treanor.</p> \n\n<p>Your most embarrassing moment on the court? My most embarrassing moment was club freshman year when I was really frustrated with my team not calling out their sets and I caught the ball in the middle of the play. Everyone looked at me and I was really embarrassed, but it turns out it worked, because my team was really loud from there on out.</p> \n\n<p>Hearing what song makes you prepare or play your best? &#8220;Centuries,&#8221; by Fall Out Boy.</p> \n\n<p>What&#8217;s your advice to the player that takes your place next season? Realize that when you&#8217;re a setter, nothing&#8217;s ever perfect. Hitters will complain, but don&#8217;t get discouraged, because setter is the hardest position on the court. In the blink of an eye the season will be over, so I suggest that everyone play every game like it&#8217;s their last, because there will be a day when it&#8217;s all over and, hopefully, on that day there will be no regrets!</p>", "title": "SENIOR SPOTLIGHT", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/481953/05-09-21-17.html", "published_at": "", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>In a sneak preview of the 2014 campaign, a GOP ad in North Carolina says Rep. Mike McIntyre &#8220;voted to spend $1.8 trillion on Obamacare&#8221; and &#8220;keep Obamacare&#8217;s taxes.&#8221; Spoiler alert: The ad is misleading. In fact, McIntyre voted twice against the health care bill, and he voted twice for the law&#8217;s full repeal in two standalone bills. The ad&#8217;s specious claim rests on McIntyre&#8217;s recent vote on a non-binding House GOP budget resolution.</p> \n\n<p>The National Republican Congressional Committee posted the 30-second TV spot on its <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=PJLGqUK4dvM\" type=\"external\">YouTube site</a> on April 3. It opens by saying the <a href=\"http://mcintyre.house.gov/index.php/about-mike/biography\" type=\"external\">nine-term Democratic congressman</a> has been in Washington too long. It then says, &#8220;And we&#8217;re paying the price. Instead of voting to balance the budget, he voted to spend $1.8 trillion on Obamacare.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The NRCC is referring to McIntyre&#8217;s March 21 vote on a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;ved=0CDMQFjAA&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gpo.gov%2Ffdsys%2Fpkg%2FBILLS-113hconres25eh%2Fpdf%2FBILLS-113hconres25eh.pdf&amp;amp;ei=apRcUbmaBubp0gHdo4CYCA&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNHoT-QXUYLsI1hEr5xRfIPMcdPrCA&amp;amp;sig2=GBilYQjb1wFdbD0ufXx-JA&amp;amp;bvm=bv.44697112,d.dmQ\" type=\"external\">non-binding resolution</a> that sets budget levels for fiscal years 2015 through 2023. It passed <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll088.xml\" type=\"external\">221-207</a> without a single Democratic vote. The budget resolution, which was drafted by the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, is a statement of the party&#8217;s budget principles. It calls for a balanced budget in 10 years and the repeal of the federal health care law. Specifically, the budget blueprint says the budget chairman &#8220;may revise&#8221; the spending levels to account for the &#8220;budgetary effects of any bill &#8230; that reforms or replaces the Patient Protection and Affordable Care or the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The fact is nothing in the budget resolution itself would repeal the Affordable Care Act. That would have to happen in a separate repeal bill &#8212; which McIntyre has repeatedly supported.</p> \n\n<p>Here are the major votes taken in the House to approve and later repeal the health care law:</p> \n\n<p>In addition to a full repeal of the law, McIntyre voted with Republicans to defund all or part of the health care law.</p> \n\n<p>For example, he was <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll285.xml\" type=\"external\">one of five House Democrats</a> on May 3, 2011 to vote for legislation that would have barred federal funding for the state health insurance exchanges that will be created in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act. He also was <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll097.xml\" type=\"external\">one of three House Democrats</a> to vote for an amendment ( <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2011-02-18/pdf/CREC-2011-02-18-pt1-PgH1202-6.pdf#page=1\" type=\"external\">No. 575</a>) to an appropriations bill that would have prohibited the use of federal funds for &#8220;any employee, officer, contractor, or grantee of any department or agency&#8221; previously funded by the health care law.</p> \n\n<p>The ad also says &#8220;McIntyre voted to keep Obamacare&#8217;s taxes&#8221; &#8212; another reference to his vote on the non-binding resolution. That, too, is misleading. McIntyre voted not only to repeal the entire law and to defund it, but he also <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.r.1370:\" type=\"external\">cosponsored a bill</a> in 2011 to repeal the annual fees imposed on health care providers by the new law. And he <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll359.xml\" type=\"external\">voted in 2012 to repeal the medical device tax</a> contained in the law.</p> \n\n<p>We should point out, too, that although the ad criticizes the congressman for not &#8220;voting to balance the budget,&#8221; McIntyre in 2011 <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:h.j.res.00002:\" type=\"external\">cosponsored</a> and <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll858.xml\" type=\"external\">voted for</a> a balanced budget amendment &#8211; which was a goal of the budget resolution.</p> \n\n<p>&#8212; Eugene Kiely</p>", "title": "NRCC\u2019s Sneak Preview of 2014", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://factcheck.org/2013/04/nrccs-sneak-preview-of-2014/", "published_at": "2013-04-04", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>Sen. Dick Lugar (R-Ind.) &amp;lt;a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/talkradionews/2510926965/sizes/l/in/photostream/\"&amp;gt;TalkRadioNews&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;/Flickr</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Centrism and bipartisan consensus often are unduly worshiped by Washington&#8217;s punditeers, who are ever bemoaning the decline of across-the-aisle dialogue and compromise. Frequently, these calls for cooperation are escape routes for those who prefer to transcend real and important political and policy divides and who yearn to position themselves above the critical but down-and-dirty squabbles that shape this country&#8217;s future. Yet there are times when the pursuit of a common purpose uniting Democrats and Republicans is necessary to advance important policy aims and to demonstrate to the citizenry that the nation&#8217;s capital can function and serve the public interest. And in an era of increasing political rancor, Washington&#8217;s ability to rise to this task is now diminished with the primary defeat of Sen. Dick Lugar, an Indiana Republican.</p> \n\n<p>Lugar was beaten on Tuesday by Richard Mourdock, the tea-party-favored state treasurer. This was not unexpected. Lugar, a <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Richard_Lugar.htm\" type=\"external\">moderate</a> GOPer who had served in the Senate since 1977, was ripe for the defenestration. Tea partiers in recent years had eviscerated other targeted-from-the-right Republican senators, including Bob Bennett of Utah and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. (Murkowski was able to retain her seat via an unconventional <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/11/17/murkowski-wins-election-write-candidate-ap-projects/\" type=\"external\">write-in campaign</a>.) And Lugar, unlike John McCain (who successfully beat back this sort of challenge in 2010), did little to protect his right flank in the past two years.</p> \n\n<p>Lugar&#8217;s defeat will be cited by the hand-wringing DC pooh-bahs as another sign of hopelessness. But the loss of Lugar&#8212;as opposed to, say, the loss of Bennett&#8212;will have true policy ramifications, for this Hoosier frequently endeavored to forge bipartisan coalitions to advance national security priorities.</p> \n\n<p>Most notably, as I recounted in my new book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Showdown-Inside-Fought-Against-Boehner/dp/0062107992\" type=\"external\">Showdown: The Inside Story of How Obama Fought Back Against Boehner, Cantor, and the Tea Party</a>, Lugar worked&#8212;that is, conspired with&#8212;the Obama White House to win ratification of the New START treaty reducing the number of US and Russian nuclear weapons. With leading Senate Republicans opposed to the treaty&#8212;mainly, it seemed, because Obama had negotiated it&#8212;Lugar, the senior Republican on the Senate foreign relations committee, collaborated with Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.), the chair of that committee, and Vice President Joe Biden to devise a strategy to circumvent his party&#8217;s opposition. This entailed undercutting McCain, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), and the GOP&#8217;s chief voice on arms control, Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.).</p> \n\n<p>The yearlong effort to achieve ratification&#8212;which was approved on a bipartisan vote as the lame-duck session of 2010 was coming to a close&#8212;was a deftly mounted effort. At one point, Kerry, though he controlled the committee, had Lugar introduce the ratification resolution in order to win over a couple of Republican senators so the White House could claim the treaty had bipartisan backing. And Kerry even complained publicly about Lugar&#8217;s resolution to make it easier for Lugar to sell it to his GOP comrades. It is hard to envision a Democratic White House cooperating as closely with another Republican senator on such a significant matter.</p> \n\n<p>Lugar&#8212;who years earlier had worked in the Senate with Obama to pass <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2008/08/25/28084/rove-obama-lugar/\" type=\"external\">legislation</a> to detect and secure loose nukes overseas&#8212;was not a pushover for Obama. Prior to Obama&#8217;s launching of multilateral strikes on Libya, he told the president he would <a href=\"http://video.msnbc.msn.com/morning-joe/42207545\" type=\"external\">not support this action</a>. He also publicly raised questions about US involvement in Afghanistan, <a href=\"http://lugar.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=332665\" type=\"external\">noting</a> in 2011, &#8220;It is exceedingly difficult to conclude that our vast expenditures in Afghanistan represent a rational allocation of our military and financial assets.&#8221; But he was the rare Republican lawmaker who preferred to collaborate than clash with the president.</p> \n\n<p>Lugar was an independent&#8212;and often reasonable&#8212;GOP voice on foreign policy, surviving for decades within a party that often put a premium on extreme and harsh positions. A decade ago, he joined with Joe Biden, then a senator, and fellow Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) to try to slow President George W. Bush&#8217;s rush to war in Iraq. In response to Bush&#8217;s request for legislation authorizing him to attack Iraq at a time of his own choosing, Lugar, Biden, and Hagel pushed an <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=iznyGV9qkjoC&amp;amp;pg=PA127&amp;amp;lpg=PA127&amp;amp;dq=Biden-Lugar-Hagel+bush+war&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=zgWHqPMEIS&amp;amp;sig=lHxGDcXhBg6HC563VpNPUz6WOAg&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ei=4qSpT72BBaaPigLBupHJCw&amp;amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=Biden-Lugar-Hagel%20bush%20war&amp;amp;f=false\" type=\"external\">alternative</a> that would permit Bush to initiate a war only for the purpose of destroying Iraq&#8217;s WMD and only after seeking United Nations approval. Absent a UN green light, Bush would have to come back to Congress and demonstrate that the Iraqi weapons threat was so &#8220;grave&#8221; that only military action could eliminate it. (The Biden-Lugar-Hagel effort ended up being derailed by none other than Rep. Dick Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, who cut a deal with the Bush White House and essentially accepted the resolution Bush was demanding.)</p> \n\n<p>Lugar was a charisma-challenged Republican. His attempt at <a href=\"http://www.4president.us/websites/1996/lugar1996website.htm\" type=\"external\">a presidential campaign</a> in the 1996 cycle was ludicrous. (During his announcement, he stood alone on a rather big stage and looked quite small.) But he was a policy-minded legislator who did the heavy-lifting on issues far from the spotlight and who was not reluctant to put aside partisanship when policy progress was possible. As Washington&#8217;s centrism fanciers predictably grieve the electoral demise of another member of that endangered breed, the Republican moderate, this is indeed a genuine loss for those who care about arms control, nuclear nonproliferation, and foreign-policy discussions that are serious and deep, not silly and opportunistic.</p> \n\n<p>UPDATE: On Tuesday night, Obama released this statement: &#8220;As a friend and former colleague, I want to express my deep appreciation for Dick Lugar&#8217;s distinguished service in the United States Senate. While Dick and I didn&#8217;t always agree on everything, I found during my time in the Senate that he was often willing to reach across the aisle and get things done. My administration&#8217;s efforts to secure the world&#8217;s most dangerous weapons has been based on the work that Senator Lugar began, as well as the bipartisan cooperation we forged during my first overseas trip as Senator to Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Why Washington Needs Dick Lugar", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2012/05/why-washington-needs-dick-lugar/", "published_at": "2012-05-09", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>&amp;#160; &amp;#160; Hillary Clinton.

Mullen&#8217;s team utilized financial instruments called collateralized debt obligations to essentially bet against subprime mortgages.

New York&amp;#160;magazine&#8217;s Kevin Roose described the career change this way: &#8220;A guy whose most famous trade was a successful bet on the full-scale implosion of the housing market is now swooping in to pick up the pieces on the other end.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Mullen gave $100,000 to Priorities USA Action on June 30. According to Federal Election Commission data, this is the largest single contribution he has made to any soft money organization in his giving history.

Because <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/tv/awards/melina-matsoukas-anthony-hemingway-directors-bring-diverse-tv-projects-to-life-1202463697/\" type=\"external\">Thanksgiving</a> sales were so inflated, some of the Street&#8217;s hottest tickets &#8212; &#8220;Hamilton&#8221; ($2,837,331), &#8220;The Lion King&#8221; ($2,087,845), &#8220;Wicked&#8221; ($1,825,028) and &#8220;Aladdin&#8221; ($1,466,570) &#8212; were down by more than half a million apiece (but still doing just fine, thank you). &#8220;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&#8221; ($846,298) also tumbled, but should continue to attract family audiences over the holiday weeks and then bring in heightened last-minute sales before it closes Jan. 14.</p> \n\n<p>Also contributing to the overall drop at the box office last week was the fact that Bruce Springsteen took a break, so &#8220;Springsteen on Broadway&#8221; didn&#8217;t add any coin to the pot. The mega-selling production picks up again this week.</p> \n\n<p>Two plays opened &#8212; &#8220;Meteor Shower&#8221; ($870,728) starring Amy Schumer and &#8220;The Parisian Woman&#8221; ($689,134) with Uma Thurman &#8212; so they probably would have declined anyway, even if it weren&#8217;t the week after Thanksgiving. Another play, Manhattan Theater Club&#8217;s staging of &#8220;The Children&#8221; ($193,707 for seven previews), started up slowly.</p> \n\n<p>Among the fall&#8217;s newest offerings, &#8220;The Band&#8217;s Visit&#8221; ($1,092,929) dipped by $200,000 but still topped $1 million, while &#8220;SpongeBob SquarePants&#8221; ($583,037) hosted critics before the show opens tonight. &#8220;Once On This Island&#8221; ($395,580) proved modest in its opening week, but can expect to gain steam following the <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/legit/reviews/once-on-this-island-review-broadway-1202629232/\" type=\"external\">critical raves</a> lavished on the show after its Dec. 4 opening.</p> \n\n<p>Overall Broadway sales slowed by $9.1 million to $30 million &#8212; a 23% drop &#8212; for 30 shows now playing.

Susan M. Collins of Maine was the only Republican to object to both options, at least openly, so Republican leaders could be hoping to leave things flexible enough to avoid more than two defections from their 52-seat majority for the procedural motion, with Vice President Mike Pence serving as a tie-breaker if necessary.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;There is a large majority in our conference that want to demonstrate to the American people that they intend to keep the commitment they made in four straight elections to repeal Obamacare,&#8221; Mr. McConnell said. &#8220;I think we all agree it&#8217;s better to both repeal and replace. But we could have a vote on either.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Senators are free to offer a plethora of amendments once the chamber takes up either plan, leaders said, so Republicans will have options and can vote to tweak the underlying proposals.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Any senator who votes against starting debate is really telling America that you&#8217;re fine with Obamacare,&#8221; <a href=\"/topics/donald-trump/\" type=\"external\">Mr. Trump</a> said.</p> \n\n<p>Conservative groups furious at wavering Republicans piled on.

The tech-heavy exchange was full of companies that tended to reinvest their profits into growth projects rather than returning capital to shareholders. But in recent years, more Nasdaq-listed companies have are looking at dividends as a critical part of their total return success.</p> \n\n<p>Below, we examine the 10 top-yielding dividend stocks in the Nasdaq 100 today, with an eye toward identifying whether any of them give you the combination of income and growth prospects that make them ideal candidates for your portfolio.</p> \n\n<p>Here are the 10 highest-yielding stocks among the Nasdaq 100 as of Aug. 18:</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Data source: Yahoo! Finance.</p> \n\n<p>The most obvious thing about this chart is the huge lead that Seagate Technology has over its Nasdaq 100 brethren. The maker of hard-disk drives and other data storage products has long been on many investors' danger lists in terms of expectations for a dividend cut in the future, especially because the company has been under considerable pressure as the mobile revolution reduces the importance of PCs, with their traditional reliance on hard drives for storage. In addition, Seagate's free cash flow has been less than its dividend payments in the first two quarters of 2016.</p> \n\n<p>Ordinarily, such a high yield would indeed be a danger sign. However, Seagate has actually seen its yield drop from double-digit percentages earlier this year as the stock recovered somewhat from lows below $19 a share, and optimism about the company's prospects are the primary cause. <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/08/05/how-seagate-technology-plc-gained-31-in-july.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Investors were pleased by Seagate's recent restructuring announcements Opens a New Window.</a>, and even though the company expects to reduce production of hard drives, it is looking at focusing more on high-end enterprise applications, which carry higher margins. In addition, efforts to expand its exposure to flash memory and solid-state drives could represent growth opportunities for Seagate as well. Rival Western Digital has also seen some positive movement in its share price, and although its yield also remains high, rays of hope have emerged for the data storage industry.</p> \n\n<p>Another trend you can see in this list of stocks is that it includes many former high-flyers that have come upon tough times. In the semiconductor industry, for instance, Qualcomm and Intel are both going through the pains of adapting to changing conditions in the PC and mobile chip businesses. Cisco has seen similar changes afflict its networking hardware unit. Yet an recently improving tech sector has lifted those stocks and sent their yields lower compared to where they were early in 2016.</p> \n\n<p>Among the stocks above, however, there are some interesting growth candidates. <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/07/06/corporate-profits-in-britain-could-soar-and-brexit.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Vodafone has struggled due to competitive pressure Opens a New Window.</a> in the European wireless telecom market, but the decline in the British pound could bolster its profits due to favorable foreign-exchange impacts and help send the stock higher. Moreover, expansion efforts in emerging markets in Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region could also add to growth. Even though Vodafone no longer has its exposure to the U.S. market after selling its minority stake in Verizon Wireless, the British telecom arguably has even better prospects because of the potential in many underserved emerging markets.</p> \n\n<p>At the same time, Paychex has exposure to the strong U.S. economy. By offering payroll services to employers, especially small and mid-sized businesses, Paychex keeps its finger on the pulse of American employment trends. As job growth has increased and the economy has recovered from the financial crisis, Paychex has been able to sustaining its own growth. With the U.S. still outpacing its peers overseas economically, Paychex offers not only an attractive yield but also plenty of possibilities for rising share prices.</p> \n\n<p>For dividend investors looking at the Nasdaq as a source of stock ideas, the index's traditional aversion to dividends has almost entirely disappeared. By focusing on the stocks with the best growth prospects, however, you'll ensure that you not only get paid while you wait for companies to reach their full potential but also enjoy share-price appreciation when they succeed in their growth goals. Seagate offers that mix for those who are willing to assume the execution risk of the storage-device maker's turnaround efforts, and both Vodafone and Paychex also have opportunities to expand their respective businesses to give dividend investors even more of what they want in the months and years ahead.</p> \n\n<p>A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

She said the person they were really looking for was in an adjacent building. Nevertheless, she attempted to tell the police that she had an 18-month old child sleeping in the bedroom.

Bryce Heinlein reflected on the events of the day telling reporters:</p> \n\n<p>At that point one of the officers grabbed the female by the arm. During that time she fell to the ground.</p> \n\n<p>Abraham scoffs at the notion she somehow fell down on her own accord. She responded:</p> \n\n<p>I have a baby in my stomach, I&#8217;m not fixing to just fall or exaggeratedly fall.&amp;#160; I&#8217;m not fixing to do anything to harm my son.</p> \n\n<p>When asked if the actions of the officer who allegedly threw her to the ground where appropriate Heinlein said:</p> \n\n<p>To this day, Abraham maintains her innocence and says the whole home invasion/arrest of her mother&#8217;s boyfriend caught her off-guard. She rejects any notion that she and her family are somehow, someway, to blame for what happened when police mistook her mom&#8217;s boyfriend for their suspect. She said:</p> \n\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t in the way. I was telling them this is my home, trying to figure out what&#8217;s going on. I got a 1-year-old that lives here. We wasn&#8217;t doing nothing but minding our business that day.</p> \n\n<p>Making matters worse for Abraham, when police entered her apartment they kicked down the door and did not fix it. Luckily, however, neighbors were more helpful than police and actually nailed the frame back together while she was in the hospital.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I knew they were going to try to justify this whole thing.

The viceroy appointed by George W. Bush, Paul Bremer, had no legal charter from the US Congress and represented no one, having never been elected to anything. He wrote dozens of laws for the Iraqis by fiat. They are still technically the law of the land in Iraq. He used Iraq&#8217;s oil revenue, billions of dollars worth, to run his interim government, even though no Iraqi voted to give it to him for that purpose. In subsequent years the US intervened heavy-handedly in Iraqi political affairs and still does so today. Few complaints of the Founding Fathers against Britain could not be lodged against the United States by Iraq.</p> \n\n<p>All through spring of 2009, US officers in Iraq heavily lobbied the new president, Barack Obama, not to honor the Status of Forces Agreement that George W. Bush had negotiated with the Iraqi parliament during his last months in office. It called for troop reductions. The officers opposed them. It called for US forces to cease actively patrolling major Iraqi cities on June 30, 2009. the officers said that step was foolhardy, and would make it impossible to keep up their collection of intelligence on urban guerrillas. It called for rapid US troop reductions. The officers argued that Iraq would fall back into instability.</p> \n\n<p>Obama stuck to his guns, and the US soldiers stopped patrolling the cities independently on June 30, 2009. In July of that year, the number of attacks by guerrillas and the number of civilians killed both fell by one third. It appears that the patrols were causing violence, not stopping it, since the guerrillas attacked the patrols and ended up killing civilians.</p> \n\n<p>The troop withdrawal also proceeded apace throughout the past year. Although Iraq remains in a low-intensity civil war, the monthly death toll of civilians and security forces averages 300-400 now, compared to 2500 a month in summer of 2006. At the height of the troop escalation or surge there were around 170,000 US troops in Iraq. Today there are about 88,000 and the number is rapidly falling.</p> \n\n<p>Everything the naysayers in the Pentagon alleged about the effect of implementing the SOFA was wrong.</p> \n\n<p>Now unnamed sources in Iraq <a href=\"http://atwar.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/02/fighting-but-not-calling-it-combat/\" type=\"external\">are leaking again to the New York Times</a>. They want to insist that the timetable for troop withdrawal in the SOFA is unrealistic. They cannot imagine that US troops will really leave by the end of 2011. They are sure that the SOFA will be renegotiated by the new Iraqi government whenever it is finally formed.</p> \n\n<p>While the SOFA could be tinkered with, there are powerful forces working against that outcome. The Sadrists, fundamentalist Shiites who follow cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, may well be kingmakers of the new government, and they are dead set against any change to the SOFA timetables. The Sadrists are highly politically networked and their relative success in the March 7 parliamentary elections attests to their political strength even today. They could prove spoilers of any attempt by the US to drag its feet on withdrawal, since they can put thousands of protesters and hundreds of guerrillas in the street.</p> \n\n<p>Nor is the threat only of renewed political unrest among Sadrists if the US stays in force. Al-Hayat reported on May 24, &#8220;The local government in Basra announced yesterday its commitment to the security agreement signed by Iraq and the United States for scheduling the US forces&#8217; withdrawal. The announcement came in reply to statements by Al-Sadr Trend in the governorate about preparing its armed wing &#8220;Al-Mahdi Army&#8221; to resume the resistance activity against the remaining forces in the governorate and to wait for orders to do this from Trend Leader Muqtada al-Sadr.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It is true that the 50,000 or so troops that will be left in Iraq as of September may not all be &#8216;non-combat&#8217; units, since there will be some rebranding. And it is true that Iraq will need the US air force for years to come, for logistics purposes. But to say that the timetable will be tinkered with at the request of the Iraqi parliament in any major way is wishful thinking.</p> \n\n<p>The US commanders were expecting to be asked by the Iraqi officers to go on joint patrols in the major cities. They got few invitations, even though they had trained many of the Iraqi officers who now gave them the cold shoulder. The new Iraqi military is perfectly capable of patrolling on its own now in cities such as Baghdad, and of facing down any ordinary threat from militias. The US is not needed for routine security patrols. While the Iraqi troops have not been able to establish order in Mosul or in Diyala Province, the prospect of the dwindling number of US troops doing so is slim to none. Iraq is just going to be a little unstable for a few years, and even if US troops stayed in numbers past the deadlines, it is highly unlikely that they could miraculously lend the place stability. Bush knocked Iraq off balance, and it will likely remain off balance for a good long time. Bush was not authorized by the Iraqi people to destroy the country. He was acting more like his namesake, King George III, than like a president who won an election.</p> \n\n<p>Moreover, as the US military has increasingly focused on Afghanistan, many will realize that they just don&#8217;t have the resources to continue in Iraq.</p> \n\n<p>Iraqi factions are finding it hard to form a government in the wake of the March 7 parliamentary elections. But they have a perfectly good interim government, that of incumbent Nuri al-Maliki, in the meantime. And it took Lebanon 5 months to form a government recently. The Lebanon case is instructive because the national unity government that came out of months of wrangling is fairly representative and seems to have forestalled further trouble of the sort we saw in May 2008. Vice President <a href=\"\" type=\"external\">Biden may or may not succeed in helping the factions make progress during his visit to Baghdad this weekend</a>, but contrary to what some American politicians say, there is no reason the process of government-formation cannot be protracted. Consensus is better in Iraqi politics than up-and-down-votes that cause some faction to lose and to lose face.</p> \n\n<p>For the pragmatic reason that the US cannot afford Iraq, and because it is the right thing to do, the Obama administration should withdraw in a systematic and deliberate manner from Iraq. We owe its people their independence. It is what we used, at least, to stand for.</p>", "title": "On Fourth of July, Let Iraq Go", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://juancole.com/2010/07/on-fourth-of-july-let-iraq-go.html", "published_at": "2010-07-04", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>On Tuesday, President Obama held a ceremony at the White House to announce his use of executive authority to expand the <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/content/ca/en/prog/blm_special_areas/nm/ccnm.html\" type=\"external\">California Coastal National Monument</a> (CCNM) to include the Point Arena-Stornetta Public Lands on the Mendocino Coast.

Former Interior Secretary Ken Salazar <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/03/25/president-obama-designates-five-new-national-monuments\" type=\"external\">announced five designations</a> before leaving office last year, and in November, his successor Sally Jewell delivered a major agenda-setting speech on conservation that challenged Congress to pass the many backlogged conservation bills that are pending, saying that &#8220;President Obama is ready and willing to step up where Congress falls short.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Obama confirmed this in his state of the Union speech, saying&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;&#8220;I&#8217;ll use my authority to protect more of our pristine federal lands for future generations.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Even Congress seems to be hearing the message. Although the previous 112th Congress became somewhat notorious as the first in decades not to protect a single new acre of public lands, last Tuesday, Congress passed a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/congress-passes-bill-to-protect-michigans-sleeping-bear-dunes-as-wilderness-area/2014/03/04/89c0dc34-a3ee-11e3-a5fa-55f0c77bf39c_story.html\" type=\"external\">bill to set aside</a> more than 30,000 acres of wilderness at Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in Michigan.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The President&#8217;s decision to protect this stunning section of California&#8217;s coastline shows his commitment to helping communities protect the lands and waters they love,&#8221; said Matt Lee-Ashley, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. &#8220;It also sends a clear signal to Congress that&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;as the President has already made clear&#8202;&#8212;&#8202;he is not going to continue to wait while dozens of parks and wilderness bills remain stalled, year after year.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The President is right to use his authority to ensure that America&#8217;s most special places are protected for everyone to experience and enjoy.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Despite the new momentum to conserve, Obama still has a long way to go to establish balance between conservation and fossil fuel development on federal lands. From the beginning of Obama&#8217;s first term through 2013, 7.3 million acres of public lands were leased to oil and gas companies, while just 2.9 million acres were permanently protected.</p> \n\n<p>The newly-designated area has long been considered for special protection. In July, the House <a href=\"http://huffman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/huffman-introduces-first-bill-as-us-congressman\" type=\"external\">unanimously approved</a> Rep. Jared Huffman&#8217;s (D-CA) proposal to add the area to the California Coastal National Monument, but subsequently the bill was left to languish in the Senate.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I am thrilled that President Obama has preserved these pristine and breathtaking coastal lands,&#8221; said Congressman Huffman. &#8220;Thousands of new visitors each year will flock to see this gateway to the Coastal National Monument. As they enjoy some of the best ocean views in Northern California, they will also provide a significant boost to the local tourism industry, already Mendocino County&#8217;s biggest employer. I thank President Obama for bringing this land into permanent protection as a National Monument.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;This is great news for small businesses, because entrepreneurs know protecting our natural assets is one way we can enhance the financial success of small businesses and local economies.&#8221; said John Arensmeyer, Founder and CEO of Small Business Majority. &#8220;Small business owners in the West strongly believe the designation of additional national parks and monuments enhances local jobs and the economy.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks in New Mexico, the Boulder-White Clouds in Idaho and the Greater Canyonlands in Utah are on the top of conservationists&#8217; wish lists for future monument designation.</p> \n\n<p>In response to the president&#8217;s action Rep. Rob Bishop released the following statement. &#8220;The legislation was held up in the Senate so the president could usurp the congressional process,&#8221; said Bishop. &#8220;In other words, the House was punked by the president. Had the Senate done its job, the bill would have been considered and passed under regular order. There was broad support for the measure.&#8221;</p>", "title": "Obama Creates New National Monument", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/03/11/3390781/obama-new-california-national-monument/", "published_at": "2014-03-11", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Elon Musk is a man of many hats, with Tesla at the forefront of the electric car revolution and SpaceX in the midst of innovating space transportation.

Hyperloop could transport people and freight from Los Angeles to San Francisco in about half-hour and the trip would cost $20 if ridership reached 7.4 million people.</p> \n\n<p>Parallel to Hyperloop, Musk is also focused on artificial intelligence, recently donating $10 million to the Future of Life Institute for a global AI research program, PC Mag reported.

Two previous juries couldn&#8217;t reach a unanimous agreement on murder and voluntary manslaughter charges against the former University of Cincinnati officer.</p> \n\n<p>Deters said he concluded he wouldn&#8217;t be able to get a jury to convict Tensing and he feels &#8220;badly.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to do what I think is right,&#8221; he said.</p> \n\n<p>Tensing&#8217;s attorney, Stewart Mathews, said Deters made the right decision because jurors he talked to after the second trial said they felt there would &#8220;never be a unanimous decision&#8221; reached in the case.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The system worked exactly as it&#8217;s designed to work,&#8221; Mathews said. &#8220;We tried it with two separate juries, and neither one could come to a unanimous decision, and that&#8217;s our justice system working.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Deters agreed with Mathews that the U.S. justice system is &#8220;the best system in the world&#8221; but added: &#8220;It&#8217;s imperfect.&#8221; He referred to outrage among some people over football star O.J. Simpson&#8217;s 1995 acquittal in Los Angeles on murder charges.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The division in this country is profound,&#8221; Deters said. &#8220;I mean, look at the O.J. Simpson case; people were like, &#8216;What? Not guilty?&#8217; OK? This goes both ways, hard.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Simpson is up for parole Thursday in Nevada after his 2008 conviction there on armed robbery and other charges.</p> \n\n<p>Tensing shot DuBose in the head after pulling him over for a missing front license plate on July 19, 2015. The officer, since fired from his job, testified he feared he was going to be killed. The shooting is among numerous cases across the nation that have called attention to how police deal with blacks. It also highlighted the challenges prosecutors face in getting jurors to convict police officers for shooting when they say they&#8217;re under threat.</p> \n\n<p>Tensing, 27, testified in his own defense at both trials and said he feared he could be dragged or run over as DuBose, 43, tried to drive away.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I meant to stop the threat,&#8221; he told jurors in his second trial. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t shoot to kill him. I didn&#8217;t shoot to wound him. I shot to stop his actions.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>DuBose&#8217;s family and civil rights groups wanted a third trial. DuBose&#8217;s family earlier called for a federal investigation and wasn&#8217;t satisfied by Deters&#8217; announcement the case will be reviewed.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We are telling the federal government that we believe Tensing violated Sam&#8217;s civil rights, his right to life,&#8221; DuBose&#8217;s sister Terina Allen said. &#8220;Tensing has never demonstrated any reasonable or justifiable cause to put a bullet in Sam&#8217;s head on July 19.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>U.S. Attorney Benjamin Glassman said authorities will review evidence from the state court trials to assess whether there are possible federal civil rights offenses that might warrant prosecution.</p> \n\n<p>Deters said Glassman&#8217;s office contacted his office after the second hung jury. He said case information has been turned over to the federal authorities.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hopeful that the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office will see fit to proceed in this matter,&#8221; Deters said.</p> \n\n<p>Federal authorities recently announced they had ended an investigation without charges in a 2014 police shooting of a black man in a Walmart store in Beavercreek.</p> \n\n<p>DuBose had significant amounts of marijuana and cash on him, and Mathews contends he was desperate to get away from police because he knew he would be headed to jail.</p> \n\n<p>An expert hired by prosecutors said his frame-by-frame analysis of Tensing&#8217;s body camera video showed Tensing was not being dragged by the car.</p> \n\n<p>To convict Tensing of murder, jurors had to find he purposely killed DuBose. The charge carries a possible sentence of 15 years to life in prison.</p> \n\n<p>The voluntary manslaughter charge means killing during sudden passion or a fit of rage. That carries a possible sentence of three to 11 years with conviction.</p> \n\n<p>The university reached a $5.3 million settlement with DuBose&#8217;s family, including free undergraduate tuition for his 13 children.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Associated Press writer Andrew Welsh-Huggins in Columbus and Lisa Cornwell in Cincinnati contributed to this report.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Follow Dan Sewell at <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/dansewell\" type=\"external\">http://www.twitter.com/dansewell</a></p>", "title": "Case against officer who killed unarmed motorist is dropped", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/1034490/case-dropped-vs-cincinnati-ex-cop-in-unarmed-mans-shooting.html", "published_at": "2017-07-18", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Businesses big and small use social media.

In 2014, simply tweeting and posting Facebook updates isn&#8217;t enough.</p> \n\n<p>Snapchat: What was once an app for sending silly selfies, Snapchat can&#8217;t be ignored when it comes to social media marketing.&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/snapchat-for-business/\" type=\"external\">Businesses can use Snapchat Opens a New Window.</a>&amp;#160;to send deals to customers to help get them in the door.

Crowdsource a Custom Wiki</p> \n\n<p>Crowdsourcing was all the rage in 2013, and in 2014 one can reasonably expect it to be even more relevant when it comes to social networks. Successfully utilizing crowdsourcing can be difficult because it requires an already high level of engagement, but if done correctly it can pay dividends for both businesses and customers alike. Crowdsourcing a custom wiki is essentially asking your past customers to develop content for you to help other customers. It could be anything from testimonials to FAQs to common issues; whatever it is, the content is coming from the customers, meaning it&#8217;s honest. It will also help you as a business get valuable feedback in order to improve and offer better services.</p> \n\n<p>3. Engage Your 21st&amp;#160;Century Coupon&amp;#160;Young Professionals</p> \n\n<p>One of the main demographic users for social networks, they would never clip a coupon out of a magazine and bring it to your establishment.

Each social network offers a somewhat different opportunity relating to how a business could offer a coupon. For example, &#8220;checking-in&#8221; on Facebook or FourSquare could unlock a deal, or tweeting that you&#8217;re at a current location could do the same. The more creative a business is with its social coupons, the higher the likelihood of engagement.</p> \n\n<p>Miguel Salcido is a veteran search marketing executive with a focus on SEO and link building.

The analyst thought that the company should benefit from rising oil prices due to its focus on the low-cost Midland Basin.</p> \n\n<p>About a week later SM Energy announced that it had put the rest of its Bakken shale assets up for sale by launching a formal bid process for its Divide County assets. The company hopes to close a transaction by mid-year. That announcement follows an earlier divestiture of Bakken assets to Oasis Petroleum (NYSE: OAS). SM Energy used the proceeds from the Oasis Petroleum transaction to help finance an acquisition in the Midland Basin.</p> \n\n<p>Toward the end of the month, SM Energy received another vote of confidence from analysts after KeyBanc said investors should buy shares before its month-end conference call. The analyst thought that the call would prove to be a catalyst for the stock because it would feature an update on its Midland Basin well results. Unfortunately, that call did not turn out to be a catalyst.

This development is taking longer than investors had hoped. However, that is because SM Energy wants to make sure it gets things right by fully optimizing its acreage in the Midland.

They were shipping in arms under the cover of oil tools.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The BP executive was explaining to me how the CIA, MI6 and British Petroleum engineered a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat, overthrowing a nation&#8217;s elected president who was &#8220;not favorable to BP.&#8221; The corporation&#8217;s former vice president, Leslie Abrahams, is pictured above, holding an AK-47 in front of BP&#8217;s offices in Baku, Azerbaijan. Like most of the other BP executives I spoke with, he proudly added that although he was working for BP, he was also an operative for MI6, British intelligence.</p> \n\n<p>This conversation, which took place in 2010, was far from the weirdest I had in my four-continent investigation of the real story of the Deepwater Horizon.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The BP oil rig blew out on April 20 of that year, four years ago this Sunday.</p> \n\n<p>Last month, the Obama administration officially OK&#8217;d BP&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/20/bp-gulf-of-mexico-leases_n_4996314.html\" type=\"external\">right to resume</a> drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. A few days after lifting the ban, just to assure the company that all is forgiven, the U.S. Department of the Interior gave BP a new contract to drill in the Gulf of Mexico &#8212; right next to where the Deepwater Horizon went down. At the same time, the forgive-and-forget U.S. Justice Department has put the trial of David Rainey, the only BP big shot charged with a felony crime in the disaster, on indefinite hold.</p> \n\n<p>The Deepwater Horizon blowout incinerated 11 men on the rig and poisoned 600 miles of Gulf coastline. What political fairy dust does BP keep in its pocket to receive virtual immunity from the consequences?</p> \n\n<p>To understand what really happened in the Gulf of Mexico, and how BP became a corporate creature beyond the reach of the law, British television network Channel 4 sent me on an investigation through a labyrinthine fun house of bribery, lap dancing, beatings, WikiLeaks, a coup d&#8217;&#233;tat, arrests and oil-state terror.</p> \n\n<p>I found the cause of the tragedy of the Deepwater Horizon 7,000 miles from the Gulf in the ancient city of Baku, the Central Asian caravan stop on the Silk Road.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>For the interview with agent Abrahams and the full story of the Deepwater Horizon, see, &#8220;Vultures and Vote Rustlers,&#8221; the documentary that will be available as a <a href=\"http://www.gregpalast.com/vulturesandvoterustlersfreedownload/\" type=\"external\">download without charge</a> until April 21 courtesy of the not-for-profit Palast Investigative Fund.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The literal source of Soviet power until 1991, Baku has been exporting petroleum for 3,000 years. As the Soviet Union shattered into pieces that year, BP set its sights on the city. It is now the capital of the new nation of Azerbaijan, which sits atop the biggest untapped oil field in the world, right beneath the Caspian Sea.</p> \n\n<p>A coup for BP</p> \n\n<p>In 1992, then-BP Chairman Lord Browne flew into Baku as soon as the young state elected its first president, Abulfaz Elchibey. Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher joined him via the &#8220;Iron Lady,&#8221; a plane the corporation outfitted especially for her. At a state dinner, Browne handed Abrahams, a BP vice president at the time, a briefcase and showed him the contents: a check for $30 million. Browne then gave the check to the president of Azerbaijan.</p> \n\n<p>Still, the new president remained &#8220;not favorable&#8221; to BP&#8217;s demand for control of the Caspian oil, so MI6, the CIA and the corporation went into action. The spy agencies armed and empowered former Soviet KGB chief Heydar Aliyev, who in 1993 overthrew Azerbaijan&#8217;s elected government. Once he became dictator, Aliyev named himself president for life and within four months signed a no-bid deal to give the reserves to BP.</p> \n\n<p>BP and MI6 man Abrahams was instructed, he told me, to &#8220;smooth the way&#8221; for the deal by taking Azeri officials to London in Browne&#8217;s jet for weekends of lap dancing and other entertainment. By Abrahams&#8217; own estimation, he paid over $3 million in additional cash bribes to make certain BP would have no trouble.</p> \n\n<p>I should note that Abrahams broke no law: Bribery by a British subject was legal then. BP executives did not deny the payoffs when I questioned them directly, and MI6 officers proudly confirmed the coup&#8217;s purpose of locking in the offshore deal for BP.</p> \n\n<p>Quick-dry, quick-kill cement</p> \n\n<p>What does this have to do with the blowout of the Deepwater Horizon?</p> \n\n<p>This: It is now well established that the disaster occurred when the cement used to cap the well failed, allowing explosive methane gas to fill the rig and transform it into a sinking fireball.</p> \n\n<p>But this was not BP&#8217;s first cement failure and explosion. Just 17 months earlier, BP&#8217;s Caspian Sea Transocean rig had suffered exactly the same fate.</p> \n\n<p>The cause of the two blowouts was identical. In the Caspian as in the Gulf, BP laced its cement with nitrogen gas. The nitrogen bubbles sped up the drying of the mixture, saving BP half a million dollars a day on rig rental charges. But in offshore high-pressure zones, nitrogen-spiked cement can fail. And it did. Twice.Question: Why in the world was BP allowed to use this insanely dangerous &#8220;quick-dry&#8221; cement just after a failure in the Caspian? Answer: A cover-up &#8212; via threats, beatings, arrests, bribery, perjury and the complicity of the U.S. State Department.</p> \n\n<p>I learned of the prior blowout only because of a coded message from the Caspian Sea received from one very nervous eyewitness. To get the evidence, I flew to Baku and headed across the road-less desert to find more witnesses.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Greg Palast and crew under arrest in Azerbaijan. Photo by Palast Investigative Fund</p> \n\n<p>But we had been ratted out. My crew was placed under arrest by Azerbaijan&#8217;s secret police. Although officers demanded our film, I was allowed to keep my pen, which was actually a hidden camera. (I&#8217;ve learned a few things from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pArBEnKcoMw\" type=\"external\">Maxwell Smart</a>.)</p> \n\n<p>How do you keep a monstrous blowout from going public? As one of the arresting cops told us with odd pride, &#8220;BP drives this country.&#8221; It drives it with cash. Robert Ebel, former chief of oil analysis for the CIA, estimates that at least <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Energy-Conflict-Central-Asia-Caucasus/dp/0742500632\" type=\"external\">$140 million in payments</a> by BP for Azeri oil has gone unaccounted for. Where did it go? Notably, the Aliyev ruling family lives like pashas despite the president&#8217;s official salary of $100 a month.</p> \n\n<p>Oil worker advocate Mirvari Gahramanli said she was beaten by police for raising questions. In case I doubted it, she showed me photographs of a dozen cops slamming her with long clubs.</p> \n\n<p>What&#8217;s worse, while I was tossed out of the country (it would have looked bad to throw a TV reporter into a dungeon), my witnesses disappeared.</p> \n\n<p>WikiLeaks and oily lies</p> \n\n<p>Just five months before the Deepwater Horizon spill, Rainey &#8212; BP&#8217;s vice president for Gulf exploration &#8212; testified before the U.S. Congress that the company had drilled offshore &#8220;for the last 50 years in a manner both safe and protective of the environment.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BP&#8217;s testimony was a lie. The Caspian rig had blown out a year earlier.</p> \n\n<p>But the lie was good enough for Congress. Based on Rainey&#8217;s assurances, legislators pressured the Department of the Interior to drop objections to plans for drilling in the Gulf&#8217;s deep waters.</p> \n\n<p>Withholding information from Congress is a felony. But Rainey has one heck of a defense: The U.S. State Department was in on the cover-up.</p> \n\n<p>Deep in the pile of confidential State Department cables released by one courageous U.S. soldier, Pfc. Bradley (now Chelsea) Manning, we have the notes from a secret meeting between the U.S. ambassador to Azerbaijan, Anne E. Derse, and the chief of BP&#8217;s Caspian operation.</p> \n\n<p>The hugger-mugger was demanded by BP&#8217;s American partners, Chevron and Exxon. The U.S. oil companies had complained to the State Department that they were no longer getting their piece of the Caspian loot and BP wouldn&#8217;t tell them why. (You&#8217;ll remember that Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was a member of Chevron&#8217;s board.)</p> \n\n<p>In the memo, which you can see in our film &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.palastinvestigativefund.org/?id=65\" type=\"external\">Vultures and Vote Rustlers</a>,&#8221; the U.S. ambassador provides the details of the blowout of the bad cement on the BP rig.</p> \n\n<p>The State Department kept schtum (quiet) about it, not even warning U.S. safety regulators. And Exxon and Chevron&#8217;s chiefs joined BP&#8217;s Rainey in the mendacious sales pitch to Congress, testifying, despite their knowledge, that their offshore drilling methods were as safe as a game of checkers.</p> \n\n<p>Justice is not always abused: Rainey was indicted on a felony charge of obstruction of Congress. However, the charge centers on a relatively minor falsehood: his alleged understatement of the amount of oil bursting into the Gulf. Neither Rainey nor BP will be tried for the deadlier lie to Congress &#8212; the prior blowout caused by the penny-pinching quick-dry cement &#8212; because the U.S. government is itself complicit in the cover-up.</p> \n\n<p>Blowbacks and blowouts</p> \n\n<p>And that&#8217;s why we are seeing the red carpet rolled out for BP in the Gulf once more.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The Deepwater Horizon rig in flames. Photo by Palast Investigative Fund</p> \n\n<p>When the U.S. government participates in the corruption of other democracies, when it authorizes bribery and ignores police-state tactics to benefit from business deals, the sins of empire can come back to haunt the nation. In the CIA&#8217;s world this is called &#8220;blowback.&#8221; What was covered up in Baku has killed Americans in the Gulf, and it will likely continue to kill.</p> \n\n<p>And bribery does not simply stay &#8220;over there.&#8221; American officials are not as different from the Baku bandits as they may like to believe. The agency in charge of regulating BP&#8217;s drilling in the Gulf, the U.S. Minerals Management Service, was rife with watchdogs who, like their Azeri counterparts, took backhanders and payouts from BP. And when I say BP was in bed with the regulators, that is not a metaphor: A BP lobbyist was reportedly <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/11/washington/11royalty.html\" type=\"external\">sleeping with</a> a chief of the agency.Don&#8217;t bother sending Rainey a file in a cake: The BP man won&#8217;t get two minutes of jail time.

As I <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">reported</a> last month, BP was the main culprit in the disaster caused by the Exxon Valdez grounding. The company walked away without paying a dime to the victims. In the case of the Deepwater Horizon, a few tenacious attorneys have ensured the corporation pays some compensation in the Gulf. But that money comes nowhere close to the damage it caused and will do nothing to harm the company&#8217;s bottom line.</p> \n\n<p>The oil is still there</p> \n\n<p>Today BP has declared Gulf waters clean, as if Mother Nature were just a toilet you can poop in and flush. But I&#8217;ve been to the Gulf shores. Dig down 10 inches in the shoals off Gulfport, Miss., and you&#8217;ll hit Deepwater Horizon crude.

The ordinance also bars immigration agents from having access to county jail inmates without a criminal warrant.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The practice of detaining people by the sheriff was also eroding the trust and relationship between residents of various communities,&#8221; said Garcia, who drafted the ordinance. &#8220;It was undermining public safety.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Cook County&#8217;s ordinance is among the first enacted in the country designed to resist Secure Communities, a controversial federal program that aims to deport immigrants who have been arrested by local law enforcement agencies.</p> \n\n<p>Amalia Pallares, associate professor of political science and Latin American and Latino studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the spirit of the ordinance could be emulated in other counties.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It is about the rights of immigrants,&#8221; said Pallares, who also co-edited a book about immigration activism in Chicago. &#8220;Every local government has to figure out what makes sense to them, but the spirit can be used to uphold the rights of undocumented immigrants who don&#8217;t have a criminal background.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>As of Aug. 31, immigration detainers were issued for 342 inmates among the daily average population of about 9,000 at Cook County Jail, shows a Chicago Reporter analysis of Cook County inmate reports. Last year, 1,665 inmates were placed under immigration hold.About 87 percent have been charged with a felony, and the rest had a misdemeanor charge, the analysis shows.</p> \n\n<p>Since the ordinance was approved, 48 inmates&#8212;36 of them with felony charges&#8212;have been released after they posted bond, said Steve Patterson, a spokesman for the Cook County Sheriff&#8217;s Office.</p> \n\n<p>It costs $143 a day to house an inmate at the county jail. By not holding inmates, Garcia said, the ordinance would save the county $15 million a year. Patterson said that number is actually smaller&#8212;about $250,000&#8212;a year.</p> \n\n<p>A recent federal court ruling cleared the way for the ordinance. An Indiana court case ruled in June that the detainer requests made by immigration enforcement officials are only a request and not criminal warrants.</p> \n\n<p>The ordinance also came after immigration activists rallied around what they say is a flawed implementation of Secure Communities, Garcia said.</p> \n\n<p>Many undocumented immigrants were being booked into immigration custody after an arrest but not conviction, he said.</p> \n\n<p>The Reporter analysis of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security records bears out his claim. In Illinois, 46 percent of 3,023 people who were booked into immigration custody between Nov. 24, 2009, and July 25, 2011, were never charged with, or convicted of, the crimes for which they were arrested, the analysis shows.</p> \n\n<p>Cook County&#8217;s unease with Secure Communities began to surface in April 2009, when the sheriff&#8217;s office opted not to share fingerprints of its arrestees with the homeland security department.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We were trying to get answers from [the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] about Secure Communities,&#8221; Patterson said. &#8220;We got a lot of runarounds and conflicting answers.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Nicole Nava, spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said the ordinance would release criminals back into communities instead of deporting them.</p> \n\n<p>Her agency &#8220;places detainers on aliens arrested on criminal charges to ensure that dangerous criminals are not released from prisons/jails and into our communities,&#8221; Nava wrote.</p> \n\n<p>Nava offered three examples of undocumented immigrants being released back to Cook County, including the release of a 32-year-old Mexican charged with a felony and traffic offenses after running a red light and then punching the officer who arrested him.</p> \n\n<p>Garcia said the ordinance was needed to clarify any confusion and to stop immigration enforcement overreach. The ordinance will also protect the county from liability in cases where immigration officials ask the county to hold someone they wrongly suspect as being undocumented.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t detain people without probable cause,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That would violate constitutional guarantees like due process and equal protection. But these detainers are not based on probable cause.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Contributing: Crystal Vance Guerra</p>", "title": "Holding penalty", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "http://chicagoreporter.com/holding-penalty/", "published_at": "2011-11-01", "bias": 3}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella continues to put his stamp on the company, announcing Wednesday an executive shuffle that involves the departure of former Nokia Corp. chief Stephen Elop.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Elop was the biggest surprise departure in the executive shuffle. Two other Microsoft executives, Kirill Tatarinov and Eric Rudder, will, like Mr. Elop \"leave Microsoft after a designated transition period,\" the company said in a news release. Separately, Mark Penn, who had served in a senior strategist role, is leaving Microsoft as well.</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Elop's departure is the latest sign Microsoft is hitting the reset button on its struggling smartphone hardware business. The more than $9 billion purchase of Nokia's handset business--a deal struck by Mr. Nadella's predecessor Steve Ballmer in late 2013--was supposed to make Microsoft a relevant player in smartphones.</p> \n\n<p>Microsoft declined to make Mr. Elop available for an interview.</p> \n\n<p>Instead under Mr. Elop's leadership at Microsoft, the company's Windows smartphones lost market share and bled red ink. The company recently said it planned to further cut costs at the smartphone business and other hardware units. Nokia already was targeted for thousands of job cuts in the biggest layoffs in Microsoft's history, announced last year.</p> \n\n<p>Last July, in an email that rankled some with an introduction of \"Hello there,\" Mr. Elop outlined 12,500 Microsoft job cuts and underlined the challenges the unit was facing.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>\"It is particularly important to recognize that the role of phones within Microsoft is different than it was within Nokia,\" he wrote. \"Our device strategy must reflect Microsoft's strategy and must be accomplished within an appropriate financial envelope. Therefore, we plan to make some changes.\"</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Elop had been viewed as a potential successor to Mr. Ballmer, and his return to the company was seen as setting the table for him to win respect in Microsoft's board room as directors searched for a new CEO. In February 2014, Mr. Nadella was appointed to the job.</p> \n\n<p>Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets, said Elop's exit \"speaks to Microsoft's view that Nokia and the overall mobile strategy was clearly not heading down the right path.\"</p> \n\n<p>Microsoft's hardware devices businesses, which Mr. Elop ran, will now be folded into a new division with Microsoft's operating systems group.

According to the report, students who reach those score targets are likely to pass their freshman courses with a &#8220;C&#8221; grade or better. The benchmarks are 18 for English, 22 for reading and math and 23 for science.</p> \n\n<p>In New Mexico, 19 percent of students who took the ACT met the benchmarks in all four areas, up from 17 percent last year. Students were most successful in English, with 56 percent meeting that benchmark, and they struggled most in science, with just 29 percent hitting the target score.</p> \n\n<p>However, the science percentage saw the most improvement over last year, when 22 percent hit the benchmark. Students slipped on the reading portion of the test, from 45 percent hitting the target in 2012 to 38 percent this year. The other subjects were relatively flat.</p> \n\n<p>Overall, 70 percent of New Mexico graduates take the ACT, and their average composite score is 19.9. That&#8217;s one point below the national average score of 20.9.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>The racial and ethnic breakdown of ACT-takers remained relatively unchanged over last year, at 51 percent Hispanic, 28 percent Anglo and 9 percent American Indian. That breakdown has changed significantly over the past five years, with the percentage of Hispanic test-takers increasing from 36 percent in 2009 to 51 percent in 2013.</p> \n\n<p>But even though Hispanic students now take the test in greater numbers than their Anglo counterparts, there is still a yawning gap between the scores of Anglo and Hispanic students. While 50 percent of Anglo students met three or more of the college readiness benchmarks, 22 percent of Hispanic students reached three or more of the targets. That gap has remained unchanged since at least 2009.</p> \n\n<p>Albuquerque Public Schools will place more emphasis on the ACT this school year, in that the district will begin administering the Plan test to sophomores rather than the pre-SAT.

Since most everything has been adequately chilled this week I doubt that by spreading manure you would encourage any growth now. Just be sure to give everything a good drink before you spread your black gold. Try and arrange &#8211; perhaps by a good neighbor or family member &#8211; a watering or two while you are away unless we are blessed by rain or snow. Then, they&#8217;d be off the hook, so to speak.</p> \n\n<p>The watering is most important. It helps wash the salts that are usually contained in manure through the soils. If the salts aren&#8217;t worked down by a good watering, you run the risk of root damage. So as long as you can arrange to get some help, spread your manure now and don&#8217;t worry about being a little early.</p> \n\n<p>Oh, be sure to insist your caretaker unfastens the hoses from your hose bibs after they&#8217;ve finished so your plumbing stays healthy, too. Have a marvelous time knowing you&#8217;ve done a good thing for next year!</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Q: It seems I&#8217;ve brought in a few flying gnat-like bugs with my patio plants. What should I do to get rid of them? &#8211; N.G., Belen</p> \n\n<p>A: There is something about finding a gnat doing the backstroke in your first cup of coffee of the morning to set your teeth on edge! Just aggravating! But you can get these pesky critters under control and live the rest of the winter gnat free.</p> \n\n<p>First, be sure that the saucers that came in with your treasures are clean. Wash them clean in hot soapy water to eliminate any of the gnats that could be hanging out there.</p> \n\n<p>Next, see if you can water a little less now that the plants are indoors. Gnats like damp homes so if the soil&#8217;s kept a bit on the dry side they aren&#8217;t as healthy. Now I&#8217;d suggest spraying the soil surface of each and every plant you have with a pesticide. You can find ready-to-use products that are quite safe at most any garden center or nursery. Look for products that contain neem or insecticidal soap in the list of active ingredients.</p> \n\n<p>Or, you can make your own spray. Mix a tablespoon of liquid dish soap in a quart of water and, voil&#224;, you&#8217;ve got a safe and pretty inexpensive pesticide!</p> \n\n<p>Be sure to follow the instructions on the label of your store-bought pesticides as to how closely you can apply successive applications, but you will want to spray at least three, maybe four, times.</p> \n\n<p>The home-made type you can spray weekly, for sure. Just be sure to have watered the plants before you spray, wait an hour, and then spray with your chosen pesticide. Be sure to get in the three-to-four sprayings so you will get the next generation, and within a month you and your plants should be gnat-free!</p> \n\n<p>While you are spraying and since these treasures did come in for the winter, be sure to give every one a good, close looking over. I&#8217;d be remiss to not warn you of other ne&#8217;er-do-wells that could have hitchhiked in with the plants, too. The store-bought pesticides should be able to handle most any bug you could find. The home-made brew should be tested on a sample spot before spraying your plants willy-nilly, if you find a need.</p> \n\n<p>Really, you can get rid of those pesky gnats by spraying routinely for the next couple of weeks and have gnat-free coffee!

Instead, she said it&#8217;s about taking the forward momentum at Van Buren and accelerating it.</p> \n\n<p>The school is on Louisiana SE, south of Trumbull. Nearly all the students at the school come from low-income families and the mobility rate is high, meaning many students move in and out of the school during the year.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Test scores at the school are still low &#8211; 22.7 percent of students scored proficiently in math last year &#8211; but have inched up steadily over the past three years. And the school received top marks on its state school grade for the test score growth of its lowest-performing students. It also showed strong growth among higher-performing students, and the school&#8217;s overall grade was a high C.</p> \n\n<p>At a presentation to the school board earlier in the semester, APS Superintendent Winston Brooks said he wants to channel community resources into Van Buren, and the district is partnering with Sandia National Laboratories and other community organizations to support efforts at the school.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;One of the problems we have in APS is everybody wants to help, but they all want to do their thing at their place, and what we&#8217;re really trying to do is coordinate all the resources right now at Van Buren and try to get everybody on the same page,&#8221; Brooks said. &#8220;And it&#8217;s not somebody&#8217;s little pet project, but it&#8217;s all based on what the faculty and the folks at Van Buren want to have happen.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Rieger said Brooks approached her about putting some resources into the school, and told her to &#8220;dream big.&#8221; Specifically, the district is eyeing a $200,000 infusion into the school, although the school board still has not approved next year&#8217;s budget.</p> \n\n<p>Van Buren was chosen for extra attention as part of an ongoing APS effort to rejuvenate some schools in the southeast part of the city, starting with Emerson Elementary School. Associate Superintendent Eddie Soto said administrators originally envisioned a project like Emerson, which is historically low-performing and was substantially overhauled. But upon visiting Van Buren, Soto said, he and Brooks realized the school already had momentum and just needed resources to maintain and enrich their current efforts.</p> \n\n<p>Rieger said she has been consulting with her staff and has formed a working committee to identify their wants and needs. She said the plan is still in progress, but will definitely include an additional counselor at the school.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The staff said, and I agree, we need more mental health support for our student population,&#8221; Rieger said. &#8220;Our children and families have a lot of challenges, and students cannot be successful in school if they do not feel socially, emotionally, psychologically and physically stable.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Rieger said the plan will probably include an additional teacher who specializes in teaching English as a second language and can work with students who are new to the country. Van Buren has a large population of students from places like Africa and the Middle East, in part because refugee placement services are active in that part of the city.</p> \n\n<p>The new teacher would be assigned to a classroom, and students who need help acclimating to the United States would be placed in that teacher&#8217;s class. The teacher would specialize in ESL but also would also teach students other day-to-day skills for living in a new country.</p> \n\n<p>Mara Minnegen, Van Buren&#8217;s librarian and a member of the team that&#8217;s planning the initiative, said students often need more than language skills, and an additional full-time teacher focusing on those issues will help students move forward.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just language,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Sometimes it&#8217;s students who have lived in a very rural area coming to live in the big city.

Politicians from the President on down state that creating jobs for American workers is their top priority. Often any jobs, as with the low-wage jobs that Texas Governor Rick Perry brags he &#8220;created.&#8221; Sometimes they want to create &#8220;good paying&#8221; jobs. But in this discourse having a job is everything, because it allows one to pay the bills and avoid poverty.</p> \n\n<p>Those who worked with Jean Alonso making missiles in a Massachusetts defense plant &#8211; referred to as American Missile and Communications Corporation but sounding suspiciously like Massachusetts-based Raytheon &#8211; knew how important it was to have a job in this society. But they also recognized that &#8221;good jobs&#8221; should mean far more than good-paying ones. And they knew, from their own bitter experience, that many jobs can be toxic, destroying the mind and soul, and sometimes the body as well of those who work them.</p> \n\n<p>Alonso&#8217;s book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1463538812/counterpunchmaga\" type=\"external\">The Patriots: An Inside Look at Life in a Defense Plant</a> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1463538812/counterpunchmaga\" type=\"external\">&amp;#160;</a> begins as the missiles fly at the start of the first Gulf War. The fragile community in the plant is strained by tensions between the patriotic workers and Alonso with her antiwar views and activities. Alonso copes with her own anguish by conducting an informal survey of how her coworkers feel about their work. She learns that these coworkers are filled with a profound sense of hopelessness and despair:</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I feel like a zero.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Inferior.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Empty.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Helpless.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very depressed and anxious.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so unhappy here I get aches and pains from it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Apathetic. I can&#8217;t do anything at home anymore but watch TV.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I was a musician, you know, so I still need to write everyday &#8211; if you don&#8217;t you have no soul. But I go home and I&#8217;m too tired.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I feel like there&#8217;s something crushed inside &#8211; I feel really defeated. It&#8217;s like giving up on your whole self in order to make a living &#8211; you can&#8217;t figure a way out.&#8221; (pp. 10-11).</p> \n\n<p>These responses, expressing feelings that had never been spoken among these workers, start Alonso and a small group of coworkers on a journey to make sense of what was happening to them at work and why. Through monthly meetings buttressed by Alonso&#8217;s library research, they explore the deadening effects of repetitive work accompanied by social powerlessness in the workplace. They try to understand Alonso&#8217;s realization that &#8220;something in this work is changing us, as if we were living by Love Canal&#8221; (p. 37).</p> \n\n<p>Over the next couple of years this group of defense plant workers examine their dashed hopes and dreams as well as an extensive body of social science literature, in an attempt to figure out just how the work was changing them. They confessed to each other that their ability to reason had diminished after years in the plant. The lack of mental stimulation was reducing their very intelligence. And, indeed, as Alonso learned from her reading, a German researcher had found that IQ declines following years of unskilled labor. This cognitive decline didn&#8217;t seem so surprising to the workers when one of them recalled being told by a supervisor, &#8220;You don&#8217;t get paid to think.&#8221; These workers discovered through their own experience that mindless work induces mindlessness.</p> \n\n<p>Alonso later realized that the experience of the American Missile workers wouldn&#8217;t have seemed strange to Adam Smith, who in 1776 wrote of the mind-destroying effects of unskilled work as an unfortunate but inevitable consequence of the then new industrial system:</p> \n\n<p>The understanding of the greater part of men is necessarily formed by their ordinary employments. The man&#8217;s whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations and he naturally loses, therefore, the habit [of solving problems] and generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become&#8230; But in every improved and civilized society this is the state into which the laboring poor, that is, the great body of the people, must necessarily fall (p. 180).</p> \n\n<p>In addition to cognitive problems, the plant workers confronted elevated depression, anxiety, and apathy. Alonso&#8217;s research convinced her that these symptoms were similar to those experienced by victims of what psychologist Judith Herman called &#8220;complex chronic post-traumatic stress syndrome&#8221; or CCPTSD. She quotes Herman as saying that those suffering from CCPTSD &#8220;have a history of subjection to totalitarian control over a prolonged period of time&#8221; (p. 125).</p> \n\n<p>The shop floor environment that Alonso and her fellow workers experienced daily was, indeed, totalitarian. Every motion was monitored. Bathroom breaks were strictly regulated.&amp;#160; Supervisors yelled at workers as if they were disobedient children. Conversations were monitored and often forbidden. Escape, while not impossible, became ever more difficult as years in the plant went by and economic chains bound the workers.</p> \n\n<p>In her efforts to better understand the totalitarian aspects of her work environment, Alonso studied military culture and found many similarities to the culture at American Missile. The similarities were not accidental. She realized that the company deliberately sought out supervisors with military backgrounds. The fact that the company was part of the military-industrial complex, producing missiles for US wars, probably made military culture especially desirable to management.</p> \n\n<p>At the time that Alonso writes about, relations between workers in the plant were especially stressed as many of the workers sought a sense of meaning and community through patriotic identification with the company&#8217;s missile-producing mission and with the war in progress and became less tolerant of those questioning the war. Pressure to not rock the boat increased as demand for the missiles rose.</p> \n\n<p>Like many manufacturing companies, American Missile had a union. Unfortunately, this was as much a part of the problem as part of the solution. Union officials refused to pursue cases of sexual abuse, wouldn&#8217;t recognize the women&#8217;s committee founded by Alonso and others, and systematically harassed militants. Thus, much of the energy to improve the workplace was channeled into often futile attempts at union reform.</p> \n\n<p>Throughout The Patriots: An Inside Look at Life in a Defense Plant Alonso weaves her personal account of nearly two decades in the factory with an account of the research into the effects of the work environment on workers. The result is one of the most thought provoking books you will find to read this year. As the politicians talk endlessly about &#8220;jobs&#8221; while providing few, Alonso reminds us that a good society will provide not just jobs, or even well-paying jobs, but jobs that enhance the spirit and development of those who work them.</p> \n\n<p>Surely today, 235 years after Adam Smith described the mind-destroying nature of unskilled work, an &#8220;improved and civilized society,&#8221; &#8211; as Smith described the new industrial capitalism &#8211; should be one that proves him wrong. Such a society would be one in which all who work find that their jobs enhance their thinking, spirit, and sense of humanity. Such a society would be one in which workers are not merely the tools of the already wealthy and powerful, but makers of a more decent world for themselves, their fellow workers, and the rest of society. While the politicians beholden to the powerful are not likely to be concerned with this goal, surely the vast majority of us ought to be.</p> \n\n<p>What did you learn in the morning? How much did you know in the afternoon? Were you content in the evening? Did they teach you how to question when you were at the school? Did the factory help you grow, were you the maker or the tool? Did the place where you were living Enrich your life and then Did you reach some understanding of all your fellow men, all your fellow men, all your fellow men?</p> \n\n<p>[From Ballad of Accounting, words and music by Ewan MacColl]</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:ssoldz@bgsp.edu\" type=\"external\">Stephen Soldz</a>&amp;#160;is a psychoanalyst, psychologist, public health researcher, and faculty member at the&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.bgsp.edu/\" type=\"external\">Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis</a>.

George Lucas, heady with the success of American Graffiti in 1973, conceived the series two years later. It was to be the story of Anakin Skywalker&#8217;s rise, fall and ultimate redemption. Since the story was too large for one film, he divided it into two trilogies and decided (for reasons best known to him) to make the second trilogy before the first one.</p> \n\n<p>He offered the science fiction concept to Universal Studios, who had produced American Graffiti. In a decision they would regret badly in the years to come, Universal passed on it because they dismissed the story as &#8220;unfathomable and silly.&#8221; In fact, every single studio in Hollywood passed on it except for 20th Century Fox.</p> \n\n<p>The first film in the series was released in 1977. By the end of its first theatrical run, it had become the most successful in the history of cinema and turned Lucas into a multi-millionaire. In the decades to come, the Star Wars brand would acquire a cult following equally among the young and the old. Some would be drawn to it because of the lure of space travel. Others would love the stunning special effects that became its hallmark. And many would love its portrayal of war between good and evil. Located in a &#8220;galaxy far, far away,&#8221; war seemed glorious.</p> \n\n<p>However, it you strip the exotic location and the stunning special effects, the film is a gripping portrayal of the arrogance, anger and hostility that drive people to make war on planet Earth. By not calling it &#8220;Earth Wars,&#8221; Lucas ensured that millions of people seeking to escape the real wars going on around them would become moviegoers.</p> \n\n<p>Addressing the Asian defense ministers in Singapore earlier this month, an indignant US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld asked why China was increasing its defense spending in consecutive years by double-digit percentages since it faced no immediate threats. He said such high spending rates could destabilize the Asian military balance. One may, of course, ask the same question of Rumsfeld. The only known enemies of the US are non-state actors that hardly justify the type and level of military spending that it is engaged in.</p> \n\n<p>While accounting for only 5 percent of the world&#8217;s population, the US accounts for half of global defense spending, according to figures released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. For the first time since the end of the Cold War, global military spending topped a trillion dollars last year. This amounts to 2.6 percent of the world&#8217;s gross domestic product and represents an expenditure of $162 for every man, woman and child on the planet.</p> \n\n<p>In addition to spending $500 billion annually on its military, the US has allocated $238 billion to prosecute the global war on terror since 2003. As Jeffrey Sachs of the Earth Institute argues in his new book, &#8220;The End Of Poverty,&#8221; the US has unfortunately neglected the deeper causes of global instability that lead to terror. Its spending on extremely poor people who live on a daily income of less than a dollar a day is about 3 percent of its defense budget. These people are chronically hungry, ill, and uneducated. They lack basic housing and clothing. Today, there are 1.1 billion such people in the globe, all in danger of being killed by poverty.</p> \n\n<p>Yet a callous world continues to increase military spending. No where is this more evident than in South Asia, where defense spending grew by 14 percent last year, compared to a global average growth rate of 5 percent.</p> \n\n<p>While always arguing that it is not engaged in an arms race with India, Pakistan has just raised its defense spending by 16 percent to $3.8 billion. The saving grace is that in the same budget, the government has announced it will raise infrastructure development spending by almost 35 percent to $4.6 billion. Higher economic growth rates in the 6 to 8 percent range have made it possible to raise spending on both defense and development. However, this should not be taken to mean that there is no trade-off between spending on development and defense. If there is any ironclad law in economics, it is that there is no free lunch.</p> \n\n<p>Peace economist Kanta Marwah and Nobel laureate Lawrence Klein have published an analysis of the impact of defense spending on economic growth, drawing upon data from five Latin American countries: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Peru. During the 1970s and 1980s, these countries spent on average 3.3 percent of their GDP on defense, which translated into an annual military expenditure of $7.4 billion (measured in 1990 US dollars). Marwah and Klein quantify the &#8220;hidden cost&#8221; of defense spending during this period, by assessing how much it lowered the rate of economic growth.</p> \n\n<p>Applying econometric methods to annual data over the 1970-91 time frame, they find that military spending had a negative impact on economic growth in all five countries. The worst affected country was Paraguay and the least affected was Bolivia. To determine the impact of the defense burden, they simulated what would have happened had the burden been reduced to 1 percent of GDP, emulating the spending cap set by the Central American nation of Costa Rica.</p> \n\n<p>Marwah and Klein find that high military spending caused Argentina to lose nearly 2 percentage points in its annual economic growth rate during the 1976-81 period. It was during this time that the generals in Argentina waged a &#8220;dirty war&#8221; after having overthrown the civilian government of Isabel Peron.</p> \n\n<p>Similarly, Chile lost annually 1 to 1.5 percentage points in its economic growth rate between 1974 to 1988, when the military government of August Pinochet held sway, after having overthrown the government of Salvadore Allende. For the five countries collectively, excessive military spending took off 1.5 percentage points of the annual rate of economic growth.</p> \n\n<p>The findings of this exercise in revisionist history are very revealing and worth pondering over by governments in all developing countries who are seeking a brighter future for their citizens. In particular, they should be of interest to the leaders of South Asia, which is home to a third of the world&#8217;s poor.</p> \n\n<p>Pakistan and India need to take the lead in reducing the defense burden on their populations, especially now that their longstanding tensions seem to be dissipating. Capping (and eventually reducing) military spending would be the ultimate confidence building measure on the road to peace.</p> \n\n<p>AHMAD FARUQUI is a member of <a href=\"http://www.epsusa.org/\" type=\"external\">Economists for Peace and Security</a> and can be reached at <a href=\"mailto:faruqui@pacbell.net\" type=\"external\">faruqui@pacbell.net</a>.</p> \n\n<p>This article was first published in Daily Times, Pakistan.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "Star Wars or Earth Wars?", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2005/06/18/star-wars-or-earth-wars/", "published_at": "2005-06-18", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Obama plans to announce Johnson&#8217;s nomination Friday.

He also mapped out the legal defense for the American cross-border raid into Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden.</p> \n\n<p>A senior Obama administration official on Thursday confirmed Johnson&#8217;s selection, first reported by The Daily Beast.

DiMarco, a dentist; two children, Jeh and Natalie.</p> \n\n<p>The official said Obama chose Johnson because of his experience as a national security leader. The official noted that Johnson oversaw the work of more than 10,000 lawyers and was responsible for reviewing every military operation approved by the president and defense secretary.</p> \n\n<p>Johnson is not as well versed in the immigration and disaster response side of the Homeland Security Department, although the administration official pointed out the Pentagon also coordinates federal relief to respond quickly to disasters.</p> \n\n<p>Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta praised Johnson&#8217;s selection Thursday, saying he has &#8220;impeccable judgment, leadership qualities and high ethical standards.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>At the Pentagon, Johnson was involved in the decision to move Army Pfc. Chelsea Manning from a military jail in Quantico, Va. to Fort Leavenworth, Kan. Supporters of Manning, the young soldier who leaked thousands of classified documents to WikiLeaks, said conditions at the military jail in Virginia were too harsh.</p> \n\n<p>Johnson led a widespread crackdown on unauthorized leaks in the Defense Department, including warning former Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette that by publishing a book on the SEAL&#8217;s raid that killed bin Laden he was in &#8220;material breach&#8221; of two nondisclosure agreements he signed earlier in his career. He was also involved in the investigation of retired Marine Gen. John Allen and Tampa, Fla., socialite Jill Kelley.</p> \n\n<p>Johnson sparked criticism when he said in a speech at Britain&#8217;s Oxford University last November that the war on terror was not an endless conflict and that the U.S. was approaching a &#8220;tipping point&#8221; after which the military fight against al-Qaida would be replaced by a law enforcement and intelligence operation.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;War must be regarded as a finite, extraordinary and unnatural state of affairs,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;In its 12th year, we must not accept the current conflict, and all that it entails, as the new normal.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Johnson was part of the team that looked at ways to bring women into combat missions and which assessed legal questions surrounding sexual assaults in the military, including how the chain of command should be involved in investigations and prosecutions. He also helped pave the way for the military&#8217;s 2010 repeal of the &#8220;don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; policy banning openly gay service members.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;For those service members who are gay and lesbian, we lifted a real and personal burden from their shoulders,&#8221; Johnson said last year at an event recognizing the service of gay troops. &#8220;They no longer have to live a lie in the military.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Pentagon lawyer picked to head Homeland Security", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/283695/pentagon-lawyer-picked-to-head-homeland-security.html", "published_at": "2013-10-18", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>Shares of Papa John's International Inc. fell more than 3% late Tuesday as the pizza chain reported quarterly sales below Wall Street expectations.

All nine banks about to get a total equity capital injection of $125 billion, courtesy of phase one of the bailout plan, reserved $108 billion during 2008 in order to pay for compensation and bonuses ( <a href=\"http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20081028142433.pdf\" type=\"external\">.pdf</a>). Guess who&#8217;ll end up footing the bill?</p> \n\n<p>Helping to pay these awards was not supposed to be part of the bailout plan. On the contrary, when the Senate, including Obama, <a href=\"http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;amp;session=2&amp;amp;vote=00213\" type=\"external\">approved</a> the $700 billion package in October, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson called this package one that would loosen the credit markets. The idea was that banks would start lending to each other again, as well as to citizens and small businesses.</p> \n\n<p>That hasn&#8217;t happened, which is why it&#8217;s particularly offensive that this no-strings-attached money is going to line the pockets of the biggest executives on Wall Street. Goldman Sachs, the country&#8217;s top investment bank (which since September 21 calls itself a bank holding company), set aside $11.4 billion during the first nine months of this year to cover bonus payments for its 443 senior partners and other employees. That&#8217;s one-third less than last year&#8217;s amount, but only slightly more than the firm&#8217;s $10 billion US government gift. Economic woes notwithstanding, those partners are still <a href=\"http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/03/wall-streets-bonus-hopes-linger-despite-losses/?hp\" type=\"external\">expected to make</a> at least $5 million each. While Wall Street may not believe in higher taxes for the richest citizens, it does believe in higher bonuses for top executives. The bulk of bonus money on Wall Street concentrates there, after ferocious internal discussions about how much each person&#8217;s contribution to the firm is worth, no matter what the market conditions are on the outside. Trust me, I witnessed too many of these during my time on Wall Street. They are exercises in pure, unadulterated whines of entitlement.</p> \n\n<p>Goldman&#8217;s CEO, Lloyd C. Blankfein, bagged a record bonus last year of $67.9 million, including $26.8 million in cash. That amount was nearly double the $38 million that Hank Paulson made at the firm in 2005, the year before he became the treasury secretary, a post for which he received <a href=\"http://www.ustreas.gov/organization/bios/paulson-e.html\" type=\"external\">unanimous approval</a> from the Senate in 2006.</p> \n\n<p>Last year, when the financial crisis was just in brewing mode, the top five investment banks paid themselves $39 billion in compensation and bonuses, up 6 percent from 2006. Two of those firms, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, went bankrupt this year. Bank of America is acquiring a third, Merrill Lynch. The remaining two, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, have seen their stock values plummet more than 60 percent.</p> \n\n<p>Yet that didn&#8217;t stop their election money from pouring out. Goldman was Obama&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/pres08/contrib.php?cycle=2008&amp;amp;cid=N00009638\" type=\"external\">largest corporate campaign contributor</a>, with $874,207. Also in the Obama top 20 were three other recipients of bailout capital injections: JPM, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley. In the spirit of not sacrificing Main Street for Wall Street, this shouldn&#8217;t matter.</p> \n\n<p>Last week ( <a href=\"http://oversight.house.gov/documents/20081028142314.pdf\" type=\"external\">.pdf</a>), House Oversight Committee chairman Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) gave the bailout capital recipient firms until November 10 to come up with some darn good reasons to be paying themselves so much. Specifically, he requested detailed information on the total and average compensation per year from 2006 to 2008, the number of employees expected to be paid more than $500,000 in total compensation, and the total compensation projected for the top 10 executives.</p> \n\n<p>Similarly, New York state attorney general Andrew Cuomo demanded information about this year&#8217;s bonuses, requesting a detailed accounting of expected payments to top management, including the size of the firm&#8217;s expected bonus pool both before and after knowing that it would be a recipient of taxpayer funds.</p> \n\n<p>As Cuomo told the firms, &#8220;The American taxpayer has provided substantial funds to your firm; the preservation of those funds is a vital obligation of your company. Taxpayers are in many ways now like shareholders of your company, and your firm has a responsibility to them ( <a href=\"http://www.oag.state.ny.us/media_center/2008/oct/bank_letter.pdf\" type=\"external\">.pdf</a>).&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>House Financial Service Committee chairman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) concurred. &#8220;Any use of the these funds for any purpose other than lending&#8212;for bonuses, for severance pay, for dividends, for acquisitions of other institutions, etc.&#8212;is a <a href=\"http://www.house.gov/frank/tarp103108.html\" type=\"external\">violation of the terms</a> of the [Troubled Assets Relief Program] Act.&#8221; Next week, his committee will hold oversight hearings on the matter.</p> \n\n<p>To combat these inquires, Wall Street has gone into its best defense mode, projecting an aura of being accommodating and self-deprecating (because it is shedding jobs, too), in order to remain in its status-quo state of self-regulation. Banks are going to tell Congress that of course they won&#8217;t use that $125 billion for bonuses&#8212;it will go to shoring up balance sheets and for acquisitions just like they promised, whereas the bonus money will come from earnings, as it always does.</p> \n\n<p>If that sounds like accounting prattle, it&#8217;s because it is. It doesn&#8217;t matter where in the balance sheet capital comes from or goes; the point is, there&#8217;s more of it because of taxpayer redistribution in the wrong direction than there would have been otherwise, and that is not just.</p> \n\n<p>According to Gar Alperovitz, economist and coauthor with Lew Daly of the book <a href=\"http://www.thenewpress.com/index.php?option=com_title&amp;amp;task=view_title&amp;amp;metaproductid=1741\" type=\"external\">Unjust Deserts</a>, that beautifully explains why too much money goes to those whose contributions are marginal compared to the historical contribution of others before them. &#8220;We&#8217;re making homeowners take a big hit, and if there&#8217;s any justification for any of these bonuses, which is dubious, sharing that burden is important.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>That&#8217;s not quite the sharing that Wall Street wanted from the bailout package, but if &#8220;change has come to America,&#8221; as per Obama&#8217;s promise, then it&#8217;s time for Wall Street to shoulder its share. Taxpayers will not be getting a personal return on their capital from Goldman Sachs partners. Getting involved in decisively saving taxpayer money from being distributed to the likes of Lloyd Blankfein before these payments are made would be an excellent way for Obama to invoke immediate change.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "And Now, Back to the Economy", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2008/11/and-now-back-economy/", "published_at": "2008-11-07", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>In a motion at the Southern Baptists Convention June 14, a Baptist state newspaper editor asked trustees of all Southern Baptist Convention entities to open their meetings to the press.</p> \n\n<p>Lonnie Wilkey</p> \n\n<p>Lonnie Wilkey, editor of the Baptist and Reflector newspaper in Tennessee, requested all SBC trustees &#8220;to consider examining their media policies, and if they do not have clearly defined guidelines to consider establishing a policy that trustee meetings, including committee meetings, be open to news media.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>By rules which state any motion on the floor of the annual meeting concerning the internal work of an SBC entity be referred to its board of trustees, messengers voted to refer the motion to all entities with a request they report back to the convention next year.</p> \n\n<p>Early this year Wilkey and other Baptist state paper editors <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">voiced</a> concern about unanswered questions concerning layoffs at the International Mission Board.

His latest device, which attaches to a backpack, is handy, but only if you&#8217;re running away from a charging bear. As the animal closes in, you push a button on your backpack strap and pepper spray shoots out into the muzzle of the bear behind you. Presumably, this halts the attack cold; Matheny did not say whether he had tried it out.</p> \n\n<p>MONTANA &#8211; When three members of the notorious Kansas-based Westboro Baptist Church arrived in Bozeman to denounce gays, adultery, lying, fornicating and abortion, they found themselves confronted by crowds of people, many of them high school students, who met their vitriol with wit and compassion. According to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle, they held handmade signs, including &#8220;Green Coalition of Gay Loggers for Jesus,&#8221; and our favorite: &#8220;If God hates gays, then why are they so cute?&#8221; A Catholic men&#8217;s group brought along a painting of the Virgin Mary, because, Tom Nyquist explained, &#8220;We want to present a message of love; our feeling is Westboro presents a message of hate.&#8221; The dozen or so motorcyclists who regularly appear when Westboro Church members picket military funerals were on hand as well; the riders rev up their motors to drown out church members whenever they start denouncing gays in the military and condemning all service members, whether gay or not, to hell in an apparent example of divine collateral damage. Though more than 300 protesters gathered on a sidewalk across from the three church members at one point, no one became angry or violent toward Westboro members Shirley Phelps-Roper, 55, her husband Brent Roper, 50, and their 11th child, Luke, who is 11. Ms. Phelps-Roper told reporter Gail Schontzler that her church protests evildoers somewhere every day; over the last 22 years, they&#8217;ve picketed some 51,000 times. She also warned anyone living close to Yellowstone that it&#8217;s &#8220;poised to vomit&#8221; with &#8220;a lot of explosions, a lot of lava,&#8221; she said, &#8220;because you&#8217;ve got same-sex marriage.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>WASHINGTON &#8211; Mike Momany, 62, probably thought he had a neat idea for a business that would have next to no overhead and allow him to charge people a fat fee. He&#8217;d guide men (no women allowed) into Seattle&#8217;s street culture, dressing the tourists down as homeless, and giving them phony nicknames and a &#8220;simple life script,&#8221; while promising that they would be &#8220;completely anonymous.&#8221; But after Momany announced his Real View Tours on a website, reaction came fast and it wasn&#8217;t exactly positive: &#8220;A Seattle man offers a tour package where you can live like a homeless person for three days for $2,000? Damn,&#8221; said Paul Richardson in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. &#8220;I can&#8217;t even afford to be homeless!&#8221; Other critics blasted the service as &#8220;tacky as hell&#8221; and &#8220;poverty tourism.&#8221; Momany responded that he believed the experience would help people better understand the predicament of the homeless &#8211; especially after his paying customers had slept on the streets themselves.</p> \n\n<p>Marston is the editor of Writers on the Range a service of High Country News ( <a href=\"http://hcn.org\" type=\"external\">hcn.org</a>).

The first is the rather obvious truism that candidates really do matter come election time. George W. Bush, of course, captured a near-historic percentage of the Hispanic vote, 40 percent in 2004. But he did this in part by distancing himself from the negative perceptions that Hispanics had of the Republican Party in general. Only 18 percent of Hispanics consider the GOP to be &#8220;accepting of different cultures&#8221;&#8212;indeed, the Democratic Party has a 40 point lead on the issue&#8212;but 30 percent thought the same of Bush himself. 30 percent is nothing to brag about in tolerance contests, but difference came in handy on election day. Unfortunately for the GOP, no other presidential name for 2008 seems to carry a similar personal advantage.</p> \n\n<p>Now as to why Kerry did relatively poorly among Hispanics, some 39 percent claimed that they had no idea &#8220;what he stood for.&#8221; Yeah, well, so it goes, we&#8217;ve heard this ad infinitum and it&#8217;s not clear what Democrats can do about this besides, perhaps, run a more comprehensible candidate (Hispanics give Bill Clinton, for instance, an overwhelmingly warm personal rating). Anyway, the second reason&#8212;28 percent&#8212;had to do with Kerry&#8217;s &#8220;permissiveness on abortion and gay marriage,&#8221; which would appear to give &#8220;centrist&#8221; Democrats <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0121/p03s01-uspo.html\" type=\"external\">yet another excuse</a> to sacrifice abortion rights in order to reclaim swing voters. But if you look a bit farther down, a pro-life Democrat would run only slightly better than a pro-choice Democrat, and support for stem cell research pretty much swamps any edge an abortion foe could bring. (Obviously a pro-life, pro-stem cell candidate would do best, but Bill Frist&#8217;s delusions of the White House aside, there aren&#8217;t many presidential contenders who take this view.)</p> \n\n<p>Meanwhile, one should note that Hispanic voters under 30 and Hispanic voters with a college education are overwhelmingly pro-choice (60 and 62 percent respectively). So Bush may have won himself a slight advantage in 2004 on the issue, but over time&#8212;given changing demographics and, one would hope, a greater proportion of Hispanics going to college&#8212;abortion will turn into a much less successful wedge issue for Republicans to wield.

The nuts and bolts of legislation and the maddening, unpredictable ways and rhythms of Congress can seem foreign to him. Most of his top advisers have little Washington experience &#8212; and it&#8217;s showed.</p> \n\n<p>Now, facing an enormous challenge in the Senate on health care, Trump and his team are opting for a hands-off approach on legislation to dismantle the &#8220;Obamacare&#8221; law, instead putting their faith in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to deliver a legacy-defining victory.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Sen. McConnell has said that he wants a vote next week and that&#8217;s up to him to run the chamber the way he sees fit. But the president is very supportive of the bill,&#8221; White House press secretary Sean Spicer said Friday.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>The strategy follows Trump&#8217;s seat-of-the-pants approach on health care in the House that almost unraveled and exposed painful rifts among Republicans. Trump&#8217;s team also failed to score major wins in last month&#8217;s wrap-up spending bill, as lawmakers blocked funding for his border wall, leading the president to lash out on Twitter and ponder vetoing the measure.</p> \n\n<p>After a shaky start, the White House hopes the Senate debate will allow Trump to turn the page on health care and get a fresh start on rewriting the tax code, a plan to rebuild roads and bridges, and his promise to strengthen the military &#8212; none of which will prove easy to accomplish.</p> \n\n<p>On taxes, a working group of four top lawmakers is meeting weekly in hopes of coming up with a unified GOP tax plan for a vote this fall.</p> \n\n<p>While health care is still unfinished, Trump took pride on Friday in signing a bill to make it easier to fire workers at the much-criticized Department of Veterans Affairs. He took to Twitter to boast of passing 38 bills thus far.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done in five months what other people haven&#8217;t done in years,&#8221; Trump said in an interview that aired Friday on Fox News Channel&#8217;s &#8220;Fox &amp;amp; Friends.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>House GOP leaders say Trump was a big asset in getting the health care bill passed, despite a fight with the hard-right Freedom Caucus that stalled the measure.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s more engaging, which means he has more personal relationships,&#8221; said No. 2 House Republican Kevin McCarthy of California. &#8220;He will tell you from the health care experience that he&#8217;s talked to almost every single member. If he sees somebody on TV and he thought they did something good, he&#8217;ll pick up the phone and just call them directly.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But the Senate is even more complicated and Trump&#8217;s lack of interest in the nitty-gritty details of legislation is a liability.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>When Trump suggested on Twitter in late May that Republicans should change the Senate rules to a simple majority vote to speed up the process, McConnell told the president to leave Senate business to him, according to three people familiar with the conversation. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private calls.</p> \n\n<p>During a White House meeting last week with 13 Republican senators, Trump said the House version was &#8220;mean&#8221; and urged the senators to make it more generous. That message was at odds with Trump&#8217;s Rose Garden celebration after the bill cleared the House, when he told lawmakers it was a &#8220;great plan.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But Trump didn&#8217;t articulate what improvements he wanted to see in the Senate bill, even as the comment ruffled feathers in the House.</p> \n\n<p>Shortly after the Senate bill was released on Thursday, the challenges that lie ahead in the Senate came into view. If three of the Senate Republicans&#8217; 52 members oppose the bill, it will fail.</p> \n\n<p>Four conservative Senate Republicans &#8212; including onetime Trump presidential rivals Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas &#8212; said they could not support the plan because it looked too much like Obamacare.</p> \n\n<p>Others, like Sens. Dean Heller of Nevada, Shelly Moore Capito of West Virginia and Rob Portman of Ohio, have pointed to concerns about the proposal&#8217;s cuts to Medicaid.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be very difficult to get me to a &#8216;yes,'&#8221; Heller said Friday.</p> \n\n<p>Trump helped House leaders corral votes, but his ability to move more difficult-to-influence senators is untested. Several of them felt his lash during last year&#8217;s campaign or, like Portman and Susan Collins of Maine, have kept their distance from Trump.</p> \n\n<p>The health care bill could underscore the perils of the president&#8217;s poor job approval ratings, which have hovered around 40 percent this year. Some of the GOP senators he&#8217;ll need to persuade have built their own separate political identities in their home states and may be less inclined to embrace Trump.</p> \n\n<p>Behind the scenes, several members of Trump&#8217;s team have been active in discussions with Senate leaders, including chief of staff Reince Priebus; legislative director Marc Short; domestic policy chief Andrew Bremberg, who&#8217;s a former aide to McConnell; Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price; and Seema Verma, who oversees Medicare and Medicaid.</p> \n\n<p>Vice President Mike Pence has made weekly trips to Capitol Hill to meet with senators about the health care bill and said he and the president are &#8220;determined before this summer is out&#8221; to keep their promise to break up Obamacare.</p> \n\n<p>Former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the White House needed to &#8220;get this health care thing done one way or the other&#8221; so it could move forward. But he put the fate of the bill in McConnell&#8217;s hands.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It may be a squeaker, but I have a lot of confidence in the ability and the maneuverability of McConnell,&#8221; Lott said.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>On Twitter follow Taylor at https://twitter.com/apandrewtaylor and Thomas at https://twitter.com/KThomasDC</p>", "title": "Health care poses a test of Trump\u2019s work with the Senate", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/1022742/health-care-poses-a-test-of-trumps-work-with-the-senate.html", "published_at": "2017-06-23", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>George &#8220;I Had no Idea&#8221; Clooney and Harvey Weinstein</p> \n\n<p>This article first appeared at <a href=\"https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2017/10/14/the-downfall-of-hollyweird-stars-er-actress-calls-out-george-clooney-producer-in-misconduct-claim/\" type=\"external\">Fellowship of the Minds</a></p> \n\n<p>Every woman has the right <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/09/14/hillary_clinton_women_should_be_believed_when_they_claim_rape_have_to_increase_prevention.html\" type=\"external\">to be heard and believed</a>, correct?</p> \n\n<p>Call &#8216;em all out girls!

Labor Notes interviewed two activists about the executive order and what&#8217;s next in the fight for immigrant rights.</p> \n\n<p>Arianna Salgado is a Chicago-based immigrant and education activist and member of the <a href=\"http://www.iyjl.org/\" type=\"external\">Immigrant Youth Justice League</a>.&amp;#160;Guillermo Perez is the President of the Pittsburgh Labor Council on Latin American Advancement (LCLAA), a member activist in the steelworkers union (USW) local 3657, and a member of the Labor Notes policy committee.</p> \n\n<p>Tell us about your experience in the immigrant rights movement.</p> \n\n<p>Arianna Salgado:&amp;#160;I&#8217;m undocumented but I have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival [DACA], which provides me with a work permit and Social Security number and protection against deportation. I&#8217;ve been involved in the immigrant rights movement since 2010 or 2011&#8230; through the issue of access to education for undocumented students.</p> \n\n<p>Eventually I got involved in the fight against deportations and detentions. We were trying to highlight the reality that people who are in detention or who are facing deportation aren&#8217;t these criminals that we&#8217;re often times made to believe.</p> \n\n<p>Guillermo Perez:&amp;#160;I&#8217;ve been involved in the fight to reform the immigration laws for 15 years. My involvement came from representing undocumented workers who were in the union that I was working for. I really see the fight for immigration reform as a labor fight, because I think that the question of immigration is fundamentally a labor question.</p> \n\n<p>The thing that we were fighting for all along was to achieve something in the way of protections for people so that they could become full-fledged participants in our society, without any regard to whether they had papers or not. In LCLAA we say,&amp;#160;&#8220;las luchas obreras no tienen fronteras,&#8221;&amp;#160;&#8220;workers&#8217; fights don&#8217;t have borders.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Obama&#8217;s announcement centered on the creation of a new immigrant status called Deferred Action for Parental Accountability (DAPA). What do you think of this new status for undocumented parents of children who are citizens or permanent residents?</p> \n\n<p>GP:&amp;#160;I think it&#8217;s an important achievement. It&#8217;s the product of tremendous struggle on the part of immigrant rights activists who really put pressure on this president to do something about the situation. As a victory we have to take it, and we have to build on it.</p> \n\n<p>The White House claims that over 5 million immigrants could be eligible for the new and expanded statuses, out of an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Immigrants cannot yet apply for DAPA or the expanded DACA. The changes are expected to happen incrementally in the coming months, unless they are somehow blocked by Congress.</p> \n\n<p>There are 5 million people eligible for DAPA and this now expanded DACA program. The challenge is getting those folks to apply, get them legal status, and make sure that they never lose it. If we don&#8217;t get enough people into the program, then it&#8217;s more likely that it could be taken away.</p> \n\n<p>AS:&amp;#160;I think it&#8217;s definitely a step towards the right direction. We&#8217;re very well aware of the fact that it doesn&#8217;t cover even half of the people in our community. But we understand how it may be significant to those that it does cover.</p> \n\n<p>The much-accepted narrative is that if an individual is in detention or deportation proceedings then they must have done something really bad to get there. But what we find is that these are individuals who were just picked up, sometimes on routine traffic checks. Even though President Obama has announced DACA and DAPA, the reality is that the deportations will not decrease. This announcement doesn&#8217;t really impact that.</p> \n\n<p>What do you think of Obama&#8217;s claim that DAPA will allow millions of undocumented immigrants to &#8220;come out of the shadows?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>AS:&amp;#160;It&#8217;s important to highlight that this whole concept of &#8220;coming out of the shadows&#8221; is&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://labornotes.org/blogs/2014/03/no-papers-no-fear\" type=\"external\">something that comes from the grassroots</a>; it doesn&#8217;t come after a politician provides some sort of announcement. The concept of &#8220;coming out of the shadows&#8221; is something that people who are undocumented have been doing since about 2010.</p> \n\n<p>I can only speak to DACA, because that&#8217;s the only one that has a process right now, but that might give us some insight into how people might react to DAPA. Individuals who have applied to DACA understand that it doesn&#8217;t provide us a pathway to permanent legalization, but also understand that it does provide us with some new resources. Before, we weren&#8217;t able to work legally, we didn&#8217;t have the ability to consider different employment options because we didn&#8217;t have a Social Security number.</p> \n\n<p>Something that DAPA may bring is the ability to have more employment options other than just what individuals have had access to, which is usually really low-wage jobs. I&#8217;m not saying that all of a sudden people are going to have access to great jobs and pay and benefits, but at least it does provide a bit more opportunity than what people had before.</p> \n\n<p>GP:&amp;#160;I think that it&#8217;s vitally important that we convince people that it&#8217;s worth doing. In some ways it&#8217;s no different than an organizing campaign that we wage. When we talk to workers and they say, &#8220;Can I get fired for joining the union?&#8221; Yeah, it&#8217;s a possibility, but if you don&#8217;t join then nothing&#8217;s ever going to change.</p> \n\n<p>Some have criticized DAPA&#8217;s eligibility requirements (high fees, criminal background checks, five years&#8217; proof of residency in the U.S., a citizen or permanent resident child). How would you respond?</p> \n\n<p>AS:&amp;#160;It does require you to prove your continued presence in the Untied States. For those individuals who don&#8217;t have access to all the documents that are required, it will be a challenge.</p> \n\n<p>I can speak to the experience of some of my friends who have had to move since they&#8217;ve been in the country. They haven&#8217;t had the opportunity to collect documents that prove that they&#8217;ve been here since they were six. They&#8217;re now 20. That&#8217;s a problem.</p> \n\n<p>The announcement doesn&#8217;t do anything to address detention or deportation.</p> \n\n<p>We can also see how the U.S. citizen or resident child requirement may be challenging for LGBTQ families who may not be able to adopt children [or may only have one parent considered a legal guardian and therefore eligible for DAPA]. It leaves out people who don&#8217;t have U.S. citizen or resident children, even if they qualify under all the other requirements.</p> \n\n<p>What do you make of Obama&#8217;s announcement that he will end the&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/06/opinion/the-secure-communities-illusion.html?_r=0\" type=\"external\">much-criticized Secure Communities</a>&amp;#160;program?</p> \n\n<p>GP:&amp;#160;If there&#8217;s a certain amount of cynicism being expressed when it comes to this part of the executive action, I think it&#8217;s warranted. It&#8217;s a victory in a sense, but it&#8217;s like a contract victory. You fight like hell, you win something in a contract, but enforcement is everything. Is ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] really going to comply? The president&#8217;s record on this has not been great in the past, so people have every reason to be concerned. But that&#8217;s our job as activists: to bring it up and to give him grief if they&#8217;re not complying with what was supposed to be done.</p> \n\n<p>Employers are known to collude with ICE to retaliate against workers who are organizing by using I-9 audits&#8212;sometimes called&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.defendingdissent.org/now/news/immigration-enforcement-a-tool-to-silence-workers/\" type=\"external\">&#8220;silent raids&#8221;</a>&#8212;to intimidate and punish workers. Will Obama&#8217;s announcement have any effect on this workplace intimidation?</p> \n\n<p>GP:&amp;#160;I actually think the executive action could be a huge help. I think it will help us in organizing workplaces where there are substantial numbers of undocumented people who now will have some form of legal status.</p> \n\n<p>AS:&amp;#160;That&#8217;s one hope that I do have for this. Both of my parents qualify under our current understanding of the announcement. My mother has faced very bad work environments. When she tried to organize she was immediately fired, and struggled for a bit to find employment after that.</p> \n\n<p>Her employer was very well aware of the fact that she is undocumented.

To accommodate the oldest members of the troupe, he added the 23-step spiral staircase into the TV room and a carpet-covered ramp into the bedroom.</p> \n\n<p>Over the years, they&#8217;ve had 35 cats, though never more than a dozen at once.</p>", "title": "Owners move from \u2018Cats\u2019 House\u2019", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/240629/owners-move-from-cats-house.html", "published_at": "", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........</p> \n\n<p>FILE &#8211; In this Oct. 4, 2016 file photo, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange participates via video link at a news conference marking the 10th anniversary of the secrecy-spilling group in Berlin. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)</p> \n\n<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; With the U.S. election campaign at an end, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange denied Tuesday that his group has &#8220;a nefarious allegiance with Russia&#8221; and said he had come under &#8220;enormous pressure&#8221; to halt publication of a trove of emails pirated from Hillary Clinton&#8217;s presidential campaign.</p> \n\n<p>In a statement published on the group&#8217;s website, Assange said efforts to discredit him by linking him to Russian President Vladimir Putin were reminiscent of the &#8220;red scare&#8221; tactics used in the 1950s to hunt down communists. He did not explain, however, how he obtained the emails.</p> \n\n<p>U.S. officials have accused Russia of the hack that captured the emails and have said their publication by WikiLeaks was part of a plot to influence the U.S. election. WikiLeaks has published tens of thousands of emails in the past month taken from the Gmail account of John Podesta, the Clinton campaign&#8217;s chairman. So far, WikiLeaks has released 35 batches of the emails.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The real victor is the US public which is better informed as a result of our work,&#8221; Assange wrote. &#8220;No one disputes the public importance of these publications. It would be unconscionable for WikiLeaks to withhold such an archive from the public during an election.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The ultimate impact of WikiLeaks on the election appears to have been muted. But there is little debate that the leaks pulled the veil from a range of election issues.</p> \n\n<p>It was a leaked email that finally disclosed the contents of Clinton&#8217;s paid speeches to Wall Street, speeches whose secrecy had figured prominently in her primary battle with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders but had lost most of their political relevance when they were revealed a month before Election Day in her battle with Donald Trump.</p> \n\n<p>The leaked emails revealed the bad blood between one of former President Bill Clinton&#8217;s confidants and his daughter, Chelsea, and underscored the depth of the personal relationships that tied top Clinton campaign figures to members of the media as well as sitting executive branch officials.</p> \n\n<p>Two top Democratic Party figures lost their jobs because of WikiLeaks: Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was forced out on the eve of the party&#8217;s national convention after leaked emails showed her staff had plotted to undercut the Sanders campaign. Her interim replacement as chair, Donna Brazile, was fired as a commentator by CNN after emails showed she&#8217;d leaked a debate question to Clinton.</p> \n\n<p>None of which appeared to have altered the course of the campaign, however, though journalists and historians are likely to consult the leaked emails for many months, if not years, in search of insights into the skein of relationships and personalities they reveal.</p> \n\n<p>Assange also came under attack. Ecuador, in whose London embassy he has sought asylum for the past four years, cut off his internet access out of concern he was interfering in the U.S. election, and he became the target of a bizarre multi-continent smear campaign that has never been explained.</p> \n\n<p>On Tuesday, he rebutted criticism that he was seeking to thwart Clinton&#8217;s election by releasing only emails related to her Democratic nomination.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We cannot publish what we do not have,&#8221; Assange wrote, saying WikiLeaks had not received leaks from the campaigns of Trump or lesser candidates that meet &#8220;our stated editorial criteria.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He asserted that traditional media, &#8220;with its corporate advertisers and dependencies on incumbent power factions,&#8221; did not measure up to &#8220;WikiLeaks&#8217; model of scientific journalism or an individual&#8217;s decision to inform their friends on social media.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>As far as allegations that Russian state hackers had obtained the emails, Assange said such charges were untrue.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The campaign was unable to invoke evidence about our publications &#8212; because none exists,&#8221; Assange wrote.</p> \n\n<p>WikiLeaks also claimed that the organization had been under &#8220;unrelenting&#8221; denial of service attacks that stretched into Election Day.</p> \n\n<p>The head of the U.S. government intelligence apparatus, James Clapper, issued a joint statement Oct. 7 with the Department of Homeland Security declaring that they were &#8220;confident&#8221; in assessing that Russia and its &#8220;senior-most officials&#8221; were behind the intrusions. The statement didn&#8217;t name the hacks at the DNC and of Podesta directly but it was clear it referred to those penetrations.</p> \n\n<p>Private cybersecurity firms that have done forensics on the digital fingerprints left by the hackers also have charged that cadres from Russia&#8217;s security apparatus were behind the penetration.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We have not published all of our evidence. We have plenty more that gives us complete confidence,&#8221; said Dmitri Alperovitch, co-founder and chief technology officer of CrowdStrike, a cyber threat intelligence firm that was hired to conduct security checks on the DNC computer system.</p> \n\n<p>Two separate and possibly competing groups of Russian state hackers, dubbed Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear, penetrated the DNC servers in the year prior to the discovery of the hack, Alperovitch said.</p> \n\n<p>Cozy Bear has been blamed for recent hacks of the White House, State Department, Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon and other government entities. It entered the DNC network in the summer of 2015, Alperovitch said.</p> \n\n<p>Fancy Bear, which is believed in U.S. intelligence circles to be linked to the GRU, Russia&#8217;s premier military intelligence service, penetrated the DNC servers only in April, &#8220;a couple of weeks before we got there&#8221; to do a cybersecurity checkup, Alperovitch said.</p> \n\n<p>A hacker who goes by the moniker Guccifer 2.0 has claimed the DNC penetration, but Alperovitch said Guccifer 2.0 also claimed a hack of the World Anti-Doping Agency in August that later proved to be the work of Fancy Bear, which released the breached data.</p>", "title": "On Election Day, WikiLeaks\u2019 Assange says voters benefited from email leaks", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/884668/on-election-day-wikileaks-assange-says-voters-benefited-from-email-leaks.html", "published_at": "", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>President Donald Trump boasted about American military equipment that&#8217;s being sent to South Korea, but said he hopes it never gets used against that country&#8217;s northern neighbor.</p> \n\n<p>Trump was asked about North Korea Thursday afternoon during a joint press conference in the East Room of the White House with Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Sabah, the emir of Kuwait.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Military action would certainly be an option.

For almost two years, I&#8217;ve been working as a cultural trainer to the U.S. military, teaching that the U.S. must know the heartland of Pakistan, from Karachi, a teeming city where so many operatives hide, to places such as southern Punjab, the heart of the country and home to the &#8220;Punjabi Taliban&#8221; and the foot soldiers involved in Pearl&#8217;s kidnapping. As a journalist, I choose to do the cultural training, because I&#8217;ll never forget the name Pearl put on the last picture I have with him. We were in Karachi, and he called it, &#8220;Clueless in Karachi.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>To know where so many men on the U.S. Most Wanted list have hidden is to know the geography of Pakistan&#8212;and not just the wild, wild west of the country&#8217;s border region with Afghanistan, but in its heartland and some of its finest neighborhoods, including military cantonments like the one near which bin Laden was killed. I created a Google map outlining cities where <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=209329569017179450454.0004a2442e4e34d5941a7\" type=\"external\">al-Qaeda operatives</a> have been picked up. Zoom into Abbottabad, find St. Peter&#8217;s church and Gammi Adda Stop, a bus stop, and behind both spots you&#8217;ll see a neighborhood where a user had labeled &#8220;Osama bin Laden&#8217;s compound,&#8221; off <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/05/osama-bin-ladens-compound-already-mapped-on-google/238116/\" type=\"external\">Awami Road</a>. It&#8217;s near the intersection of roads named for Pakistan&#8217;s founder, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, and the country&#8217;s Walt Whitman, poet Allama Iqbal.</p> \n\n<p>Photos: <a href=\"/content/dailybeast/galleries/2011/05/02/osama-bin-laden-s-death-the-world-reacts.html\" type=\"external\">The World Reacts</a></p> \n\n<p>While I haven&#8217;t been to Abbottabad, a city of about 125,000 people, it&#8217;s like hill stations I&#8217;ve visited around the nation&#8217;s capital, scenic, peaceful and home to top schools and resort hotels. I&#8217;ve driven not far from it on the highway to Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a magical land that writer Rudyard Kipling traveled and wrote poetic prose about.</p> \n\n<p>Located on the Silk Road, known as the Korakoram Highway, it&#8217;s no outpost outside central government authority, like the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, where so much U.S. military strategy and media attention has been focused. It&#8217;s home to the Pakistan Military Academy, the equivalent of Pakistan&#8217;s West Point. It&#8217;s also got an important military cantonment as the headquarters of a brigade in the Second Division of Pakistan&#8217;s Northern Army Corps.</p> \n\n<p>The namesake for Abbottabad, British Army Major James Abbott, founded the town in 1853, the &#8220;abad&#8221; in its name meaning &#8220;a place of living&#8221; in Urdu. Abbott wrote a poem called Abbottabad, enshrined in a <a href=\"http://www.panoramio.com/photo/21593241\" type=\"external\">city plaque</a>, that has an eerie ring today: &#8220;I remember the day when I first came here/And smelt the sweet Abbottabad air/The trees and ground covered with snow/Gave us indeed a brilliant show/To me the place seemed like a dream/And far ran a lonesome stream/The wind hissed as if welcoming us/The pine swayed creating a lot of fuss/And the tiny cuckoo sang it away/A song very melodious and gay/I adored the place from the first sight/And was happy that my coming here was right/And eight good years here passed very soon/And we leave our perhaps on a sunny noon/Oh Abbottabad we are leaving you now/ To your natural beauty do I bow/Perhaps your winds sound will never reach my ear/My gift for you is a few sad tears/I bid you farewell with a heavy heart/Never from my mind will your memories thwart.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Bin Laden is no longer a threat to the U.S., but a deeper problem remains: Pakistan&#8217;s safe harbor for men intent on harming the U.S.</p> \n\n<p>Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.</p> \n\n<p>A speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).</p> \n\n<p>In much the same whimsy, we act as if Pakistan has just had a simple &#8220;friendship&#8221; in America&#8217;s fight against al Qaeda, but the truth is that its role as a safe space for ideologues dates back to 1979. That year, an Islamist movement came to Pakistan under a military dictator, Gen. Zia ul Haq. Pakistani intelligence began supporting the mujahideen, or &#8220;freedom fighters.&#8221; In the years after, men from bin Laden to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM) found an ideological and operational base in Pakistan. As a nation, we turned a blind eye because the freedom fighters were battling the U.S. enemy, the Soviet Union, after its 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. In 1989, the Soviets were defeated, and ideologues, including bin Laden, turned their eyes to attacks on the U.S.</p> \n\n<p>Since then, bin Laden&#8217;s killing is the latest in a long string of bad guys found, killed, or snatched in Pakistan. In 1993, we had our first attack on the World Trade Center, and on Feb. 17, 1995, according to media reports, U.S. officials raided room number 16 in the Su-Casa Guest House in the city of Islamabad and captured the operational leader of the 1993 World Trade Center attack, Ramzi Yousef, before he headed off for the border city of Peshawar. He was a Pakistani, and he was the nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.</p> \n\n<p>In 1994, British-Pakistani Muslim militant Omar Sheikh was arrested in India for allegedly kidnapping an American in New Delhi. On Dec. 31, 1999, he was freed in exchange for prisoners taken captive on an Indian Airlines jet hijacked from Kathmandu, Nepal, and diverted to Kandahar, Afghanistan, the headquarters for the Taliban in their emergence to power in Afghanistan. At the airport to give the men a welcome home party, according to Sheikh&#8217;s FBI report: bin Laden, who was a guest of the Taliban in Kandahar. From Kandahar in southern Afghanistan, Omar Sheikh slipped easily into Pakistan, was feted at a party in the coastal city of Karachi and then settled down, marrying and welcoming a son, in the Punjab province capital of Lahore. He moved freely in Pakistan, though the U.S. pressed for extradition on the 1994 kidnapping charge. In early January 2002, Sheikh met Wall Street Journal reporter Pearl at the Akbar Hotel in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, outside Islamabad, and hatched his plot to kidnap him. On Feb. 5, 2002, Sheikh turned himself into Pakistani intelligence in the city of Lahore, and the ISI secretly held him for a week before telling the FBI and the CIA.</p> \n\n<p>The next month, in March 2002, FBI agents and CIA officials raided a safehouse in the city of Faisalabad, also in the province of Punjab, and picked up a senior al-Qaeda operational leader, Abu Zubaydah, who offered the U.S. its first clues that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the mastermind behind 9/11. He disclosed something we hardly ever acknowledge: al-Qaeda operatives, from &#8220;shoe bomber&#8221; Richard Reid to failed &#8220;dirty bomber&#8221; Jose Padilla, freely traveled the roads through Pakistan to get operational instructions from KSM in Karachi.</p> \n\n<p>That spring, KSM and another senior al-Qaeda operational leader Ramzi bin al-Shibh secretly gave an audacious interview to al Jazeera reporter Yosri Fouda, taking credit for 9/11. The interview aired on the first anniversary of 9/11, and, sure enough, on Sept. 11, 2002, U.S. officials picked up Ramzi bin al-Shibh in a safehouse in the posh Defence Housing Authority neighborhood of Karachi, not far from where I had rented a home months earlier.</p> \n\n<p>The next year, on March 1, 2003, where did CIA officials pick up Khalid Sheikh Mohammed? A comfortable home in a military cantonment in the city of Rawalpindi. The list goes on and on. It&#8217;s not shocking to me that bin Laden was killed in the heart of Pakistan. As a Muslim dedicated to defeating the ideology of men like bin Laden, I said to myself what it is we are taught to say as Muslims whenever anyone dies: \"Innalilahi wa inna ilayhi rajioon.\" It means: &#8220;To God we belong and to Him we will return.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Bin Laden is no longer a threat to the U.S., but a deeper problem remains: Pakistan&#8217;s safe harbor for men intent on harming the U.S. What matters now is that the U.S. stop enabling this very serious problem of Pakistan&#8217;s culture of denial for its base as a safe space for militants and al-Qaeda operatives. &#8220;Never from my mind will your memories thwart,&#8221; Major Abbott said of the city where, about 150 years later, Osama bin Laden, America&#8217;s No. 1 enemy in the world, was killed.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.asranomani.com/\" type=\"external\">Asra Q.

For example, Senator Jeff Merkley found himself on the receiving end of an <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">earlier Moron Alert</a> for claiming that the Supreme Court vacancy was a \"stolen seat,\" thus justifying a filibuster of Gorsuch's confirmation.</p> \n\n<p>Since then, news of Gorsuch has been relatively quiet. However, senior United States senator from New Mexico Tom Udall met with Gorsuch today. While he did not explicitly suggest whether he would vote for or against him, he gave the following idea to the press: Nominate Gorsuch and former Obama nominee Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court at the same time.</p> \n\n<p>Here was Udall's full comment:</p> \n\n<p>You had President Trump saying, &#8216;I want to unite the country, I&#8217;m a deal-maker, I&#8217;m going to bring people together. Well, the deal right now for President Trump, if he wanted to do it, would be to put Gorsuch and Merrick Garland on the court at the same time.</p> \n\n<p>Here was how Politico <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/tom-udall-neil-gorsuch-merrick-garland-235442\" type=\"external\">described</a> Udall's justification for his ludicrous idea to place ten justices on the Supreme Court:</p> \n\n<p>Trump would discuss the option with one of the three Supreme Court justices often mentioned as retirement prospects in the coming years &#8211; Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer or Anthony Kennedy &#8211; and secure a resignation letter from one of them, contingent on Garland getting nominated and confirmed as their replacement.</p> \n\n<p>This entire idea is ridiculous for a handful of reasons:</p> \n\n<p>First, the Supreme Court has consisted of nine justices ever since Congress <a href=\"http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/landmark_10.html\" type=\"external\">passed</a> the Judiciary Act of 1869. The law <a href=\"https://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&amp;amp;fileName=016/llsl016.db&amp;amp;recNum=79\" type=\"external\">states</a> the following and it has not been amended since:</p> \n\n<p>That the Supreme Court of the United States shall hereafter consist of the Chief Justice of the United States and eight associate justices, any six of whom shall constitute a quorum</p> \n\n<p>Second, the last attempt to increase the number of Supreme Court justices came from President Franklin Roosevelt in an <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/when-franklin-roosevelt-clashed-with-the-supreme-court-and-lost-78497994/\" type=\"external\">attempt to pack the court</a> in response to the Court's continuous rejection of his unconstitutional New Deal laws. That was seen as a considerable constitutional crisis where FDR intended to use the legislature to force his agenda down the throat of the judiciary.</p> \n\n<p>Third, Udall's stroke of \"genius\" only represents a final attempt to bring another judicial <a href=\"https://www.conservativereview.com/commentary/2016/03/judge-merrick-garland-a-moderate-a-centrist-not-hardly\" type=\"external\">\"moderate\"</a> into the Supreme Court to undermine conservatives' hopes of putting additional originalists on the bench. Obama and the Democratic Party lost their privilege to nominate Supreme Court justices and federal judgeships the moment Donald Trump swore his oath to the Constitution on January 20, 2017.</p> \n\n<p>Fourth, and far more substantially, it justifies giving the President power to force the resignation of a Supreme Court justice in order to promulgate an agenda. It was an issue when FDR, Lyndon Johnson, or Richard Nixon attempted to do so during their respective presidencies and it should not be a normalized practice under Trump or any other administration. It is also a gross abuse of power for the executive to directly toy with the make-up of the judiciary to ensure that the Court may rule in his favor in the event of constitutional misconduct.</p> \n\n<p>Nevertheless, Udall believes that any \"true\" attempt to unite the country surrounds the nomination and the confirmation of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court even if it violates nearly 150 years of precedent and if it means undermining the will of the American people <a href=\"http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/poll-majority-of-americans-want-supreme-court-to-interpret-the-constitution-as-originally-written/article/2611261?custom_click=rss\" type=\"external\">who want to see more originalists on the Supreme Court</a>. Such pie-in-the-sky thinking completely ignores the laws of the land, undermines the judiciary, and presents itself as the last act of desperation of a party that refuses to accept that Obama is no longer the President of the United States.</p> \n\n<p>Politico also stipulated the following for Udall's radically moronic idea:</p> \n\n<p>Udall&#8217;s proposal also mirrors an episode from the fifth season of &#8220;The West Wing,&#8221; when staffers for fictional President Jed Bartlet &#8212; faced with a high court vacancy following the death of an associate justice &#8212; persuade the show&#8217;s chief justice to also resign so Bartlet could announce a pair of nominees who wouldn&#8217;t change the ideological balance of the court.</p> \n\n<p>As if anything that comes out of a fictional television show should act as basis for real-life policy.</p> \n\n<p>You cannot make this stuff up.</p> \n\n<p>Follow Elliott on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ElliottRHams\" type=\"external\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ElliottRHams/\" type=\"external\">Facebook</a>.</p>", "title": "MORON ALERT: Senator Tom Udall Says Gorsuch And Garland Should Be Confirmed Simultaneously", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://dailywire.com/news/13922/moron-alert-senator-tom-udall-says-gorsuch-and-elliott-hamilton", "published_at": "2017-02-27", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>Virginia Baptists will gather in Roanoke Nov. 11-12 for Connect:2008, the annual meeting of the Baptist General Association of Virginia.</p> \n\n<p>Although preregistration has now closed, churches that have not preregistered all of their eligible messengers may register messengers on-site.

Earlier this month, the Census Bureau updated the public on changes it has made to improve the survey's results, and in that report, it included intriguing new insight into Americans' net worth. Specifically, U.S. households' median net worth reached $80,039 in 2013. Are you keeping pace?</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>The Census Bureau's estimate of household net worth comes from its 2014 survey, which reflects changes that more accurately show where net worth is coming from. The 2014 survey now includes questions on subjects such as annuities, passive business ownership, education savings accounts, and the cash value of life insurance. According to the Census Bureau, without including these new questions, the median net worth of households could have been reported to be as low as $74,083.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Getty Images.</p> \n\n<p>The biggest contributor to Americans' net worth is home equity. Overall, 63% of the survey's respondents say they have equity in their home, and the bureau reports that, across all respondents, equity represents about one-third of the median $80,039 in net worth.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>If you're a home owner, and you're curious how your equity compares to that of other homeowners, the median value of home equity that was reported was $81,000.</p> \n\n<p>A 401(k) plan or a thrift savings plan, a type of defined contribution plan that's offered to government employees, was the second-biggest contributor to U.S. household net worth. Overall, 40.7% of respondents say they have one of those plans, and that the median value of their account is $46,000.</p> \n\n<p>Individual retirement accounts and Keogh accounts are also popular, with 28% of people surveyed saying they have one, with a median balance of $40,000.</p> \n\n<p>Americans' assets also commonly include the cash value of a life insurance plan, and stocks or mutual funds. About 19% of people report a median $12,000 in cash value of life insurance, and 20% say they have a median $32,500 in stocks or mutual funds.</p> \n\n<p>Student loans and credit card debt were the biggest unsecured liabilities weighing down net worth. Mortgages and auto loans were included in the asset column, because on average, home and car owners reported having equity in them.</p> \n\n<p>More than half of households owe debt that is unsecured by collateral, and over 40% report owing money on credit cards and store bills. The median amount that's owed on credit cards is only $3,000, so student loans that are the biggest drag on U.S. net worth. Almost 20% of Americans owe a median $18,000 in student loans or other education-related debt.</p> \n\n<p>Americans' biggest assets are their home and retirement plans, so if you're on the fence about buying a home, or increasing your contribution rate to your 401(k) plan, those two moves could be your best options for increasing net worth over time.</p> \n\n<p>If you already own your home, making an additional mortgage payment every year can help you quickly build up home equity, and it can save you thousands of dollars in interest payments at the same time. A smart and budget-friendly way to increase your contributions to your 401(k) is to boost your contribution annually by the amount of your pay raise.</p> \n\n<p>On the liabilities side of your ledger, revolving credit card debt is a big no-no because credit card interest rates can be high, and money that's used to make monthly credit card payments can be better used if it's invested in your IRA.</p> \n\n<p>Overall, set reasonable goals for increasing your net worth, and check in annually on your progress toward those goals. Remember, however, that most of your net worth comes from homes and investments, and returns on those assets can vary widely in the short term, so make sure you set your goals with a long-term mindset.</p> \n\n<p>The $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

Of course, knowing when a particular commodity will fall out of favor and when it will be a leader is difficult.</p> \n\n<p>So there are advantages to a diversified commodities exchange traded fund, such as the WisdomTree Continuous Commodity Index Fund (NYSE:GCC), which tracks the Thomson Reuters Equal Weight Continuous Commodity Total Return Index. An ETF like GCC can be particularly useful during periods of commodities volatility or when the asset class swings between various extremes as it did last month.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>While the overall month was positive, the index was filled with extremes. Lean hogs and feeder cattle are having their 2nd worst months in history, the worst since Dec. 2003 and Aug. 2002, respectively. This drove livestock to return its 7th worst month ever since Dec. 2003 when it lost 15.8%. On the other hand, sugar and lead each posted 11.3% gains this month, said S&amp;amp;P Dow Jones Indices <a href=\"http://www.indexologyblog.com/2016/10/03/commodities-post-best-september-in-six-years/\" type=\"external\">in a recent note Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>GCC offers investors exposure to seven sub-sets of the commodities space: energy, grains, industrial metals, livestock, natural gas, precious metals and softs. Within the ETF, investors will find familiar fare such as gold, oil and silver along with more obscure commodities, such as cocoa, coffee and a sugar.</p> \n\n<p>Commodities are on pace to have several big winners and losers this year. Thus far gold and zinc are set to have their 3rd best years in history while feeder cattle is set to post its worst year. Below is a table of commodities that are closest to be on pace for record setting years. Although natural gas is having one of its best years, it is still negative it has only ever been positive six times through the year at this point, adds S&amp;amp;P Dow Jones Indices.</p> \n\n<p>Another advantage is that it equal weights its lineup, which limits the contributions, negative and positive, an individual commodity makes toward the ETF's performance. Additionally, the ETF's rebalancing frequency ensures commodities that are seeing increases in volatility are limited or pulled from GCC's lineup.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>2016 Benzinga.com.

In Arkansas, Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR) holds a 10-point lead over GOP challenger Tom Cotton, 46%-36%. In Louisiana, Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) is ahead of likely GOP front-runner Bill Cassidy, 42%-18% (the free-for-all November race will go to a December runoff if no one surpasses 50%, so Landrieu&#8217;s lead is not as impressive as you might think for now). In North Carolina, Sen. Kay Hagan (D-NC) is up 42%-40% over GOP front-runner Thom Tillis (and up 41%-39% over the other leading GOPer in the race, Greg Brannon). And in Kentucky, it&#8217;s Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell at 44%, Democrat Alison Grimes at 43%. Perhaps the most important result here are the Arkansas numbers, because they confirm other polling we&#8217;ve seen showing Pryor ahead. The poll also shows that North Carolina is headed -- as we&#8217;ve said before -- to be this cycle&#8217;s true bellwether for Senate control, because it&#8217;s truly a &#8220;generic D&#8221; vs &#8220;generic R&#8221; result. And the poll cements the conventional wisdom that the Kentucky Senate race is a pure toss-up. Of course, these vulnerable Democratic incumbents are below 50% (and Landrieu and Hagan are in the low 40s), so they are still in dangerous territory. But the important news for Democrats is that these races are far from done, meaning that Republicans winning the Senate in November (or December) is far from a sure thing.</p> \n\n<p>The bad news for Democrats: Obama remains a liability in these states</p> \n\n<p>The bad news for Democrats is that President Obama remains a big liability in these Southern races. According to the poll, his approval rating among registered voters is 32% in Kentucky, 33% in Arkansas, 41% in North Carolina, and 42% in Louisiana. Strikingly, however, the Democratic governors in Arkansas and Kentucky are very popular (Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe has a 68% approval rating, and Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear has a 56% rating), while the GOP governors in Louisiana and North Carolina are in rough shape (Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is at 40%, and North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory is at 43%). In fact, don&#8217;t be surprised if Dems in Louisiana and North Carolina try and make the Republican governors more of an issue as basically a counterpoint to the president. Still, the other bad news for Democrats is that Republicans have other ways to get to a majority beyond these southern races -- given that they&#8217;ve put Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, and New Hampshire into play (or somewhat into play). But with six months to go until Election Day, Democrats can take comfort that no one is going to write off these southern races. And that&#8217;s an important victory for them. Already, the GOP thinks it has three pickups on the board (SD, WV, and MT), if the Democrats can keep them from adding any more into their column in this EARLY stage and force them to be competing in a wider playing field for longer, it&#8217;s an important development.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_saLrADKqNM\" type=\"external\">&#8220;For relaxing times, make it Suntory time&#8221;</a></p> \n\n<p>Meanwhile, President Obama has arrived in Japan -- the first leg of his overseas trip to Asia. At 8:30 pm ET, he participates in an arrival ceremony and holds a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Abe at 11:00 pm ET. Some have dubbed this trip as an effort to &#8220;contain&#8221; China. But more than anything else, the trip is about giving love to the United States&#8217; leading allies in this region -- Japan and South Korea. Both countries have felt as if the U.S. hasn&#8217;t given them the ally love that they deserve, especially as the U.S. moves closer to China. So this trip is about Obama reassuring both key U.S. allies that the U.S. will play favorites in the region on their behalf. And yes, while the U.S. denies it, there is an obvious &#8220;contain China&#8221; strategy going on here.</p> \n\n<p>Bob Dole&#8217;s tour through Kansas</p> \n\n<p>Don&#8217;t miss the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/bob-dole-is-back-in-kansas-running-for-nothing-but-running-hard/2014/04/22/21c15ef6-c9eb-11e3-b81a-6fff56bc591e_story.html\" type=\"external\">Washington Post&#8217;s Dan Balz</a> on Bob Dole&#8217;s tour through Kansas, where the 90-year-old former senator and former presidential candidate is thanking his former constituents. &#8220;He is running for nothing but is nonetheless running hard. He made three stops on Monday, four more on Tuesday, including at the Dole Institute, which is named for him, at the University of Kansas here in Lawrence. He has two stops planned for Wednesday. That&#8217;s just a warm-up. When he returns next month, he has 16 stops on his schedule&#8230; &#8216;I&#8217;ve got a 45-year-old-mind trapped in a 90-year-old body,&#8217; he joked at the Senior Center in Paola.&#8221; Dole on Obama: &#8220;&#8216;I think President Obama certainly means well,&#8217; he said, &#8216;but without being critical &#8212; because I&#8217;m not here for that purpose &#8212; I think he needs to get acquainted with more members of Congress. .&#8201;.&#8201;.

And even with all the law&#8217;s setbacks, we&#8217;re seeing benefits for thousands of people in Louisiana.&#8221; More from Landrieu: &#8220;I think the benefits that people have received are worth fighting for&#8230; I think Bill Cassidy is going to be at a distinct disadvantage. He has insurance, but he&#8217;s also denying it to the 242,000 people who fall into the Jindal gap [not expanding Medicaid]. He also wants to take coverage away from tens of thousands who have gotten it for the first time.&#8221; Don&#8217;t miss Landrieu&#8217;s &#8220;Jindal gap&#8221; remark when it comes to the GOP governor&#8217;s refusal to expand Medicaid.

Kay Hagan participated in their first televised debate last night, and the state&#8217;s top political writer essentially declared Thom Tillis the winner. The <a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/04/22/3803308/christensen-senate-debate-reflects.html#emlnl=Today_at_a_Glance\" type=\"external\">Raleigh News &amp;amp; Observer&#8217;s Rob Christensen</a>: &#8220;State House Speaker Thom Tillis, who has been leading in the polls and in fundraising, emerged from the debate largely unscathed despite frequent barbs from Cary physician Greg Brannon, his tea party opponent. The other two candidates, Charlotte pastor Mark Harris and Heather Grant, a nurse practitioner in Wilkes County, chose not to engage their opponents in a debate that was surprisingly staid. The winner by default was Tillis, who had the most to risk because he has an extensive public record to defend and only rarely did he have to do so.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The war over women&#8217;s votes</p> \n\n<p>If you want to see how contraception remains a potent issue for Democrats, just check out this new <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y11L7Z2A9vs\" type=\"external\">TV ad</a> Sen.

Gardner even championed an eight-year crusade to outlaw birth control. And if you want to see how Republicans are trying to parry the &#8220;war on women&#8221; attacks from Democrats, observe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dc_AAje-4l0\" type=\"external\">this ad</a> by GOP Senate candidate Terri Lynn Land in Michigan, which knocks down the idea she&#8217;s anti-woman (after previously saying that women prefer work flexibility to more pay). \"Congressman Gary Peters and his buddies want you to believe I'm waging a war on women,\" she says to the camera and later concludes: \"As a woman, I might know a LITTLE bit more about women than [Democrat] Gary Peters.\"</p> \n\n<p>Clawson wins GOP special primary in Florida</p> \n\n<p>In the special GOP congressional primary in Florida to replace Rep. Trey Radel -- who resigned after being pleading guilty to cocaine-possession charges -- businessman Curt Clawson came out on top and is likely headed to Congress. <a href=\"http://atr.rollcall.com/self-funding-republican-wins-primary-in-race-to-replace-trey-radel/?dcz=\" type=\"external\">Roll Call</a>: &#8220;Clawson won with 38 percent of the vote, with 95 percent of precincts reporting at the time the Associated Press called the race.

Road trips are one of those mysterious things families feel compelled to do but no one knows why, like camping in the Mojave Desert or supporting the career of Miley Cyrus. I predict in the end it won&#8217;t be gay marriage that brings about the destruction of the American family. It will be the road trip.</p> \n\n<p>After getting the kids settled into the back seat of our Honda Odyssey with their DVD players and movies, we hit the freeway. Once out of L.A., I was finally able to sit back, pop open my laptop, and begin jotting down a few ideas for this column. That&#8217;s when Kelly woke from his nap and grabbed the steering wheel from me, babbling some nonsense about &#8220;safety&#8221; and not using my computer while driving. So we switched seats.</p> \n\n<p>Relocated to the passenger side, &#8220;safely,&#8221; I narrowed my list of possible topics to two: &#8220;Surviving Your Child&#8217;s K-Mart Taste&#8221; and &#8220;Parents I Hate.&#8221; Then suddenly &#8212; at 70 miles per hour &#8212; the transmission on our car blew out. And a column was born.</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;m an American, a proud gay American who was raised to believe that bad things don&#8217;t happen to Hondas. Yet ours has blown two transmissions in five years.</p> \n\n<p>As we decelerated, the plume of smoke belching from underneath our hood began to panic my unflappable daughter. I tried to calm her as Kelly looked for a place to get off the road. &#8220;Think of it as an adventure, honey! We&#8217;re inside a fire-breathing dragon who just lost a leg!&#8221; She began to cry.</p> \n\n<p>Somehow we managed to limp across four lanes of traffic to the next exit and turn down a hill into the welcoming parking lot of a visitors center that overlooked a picturesque lake. A visitors center with bathrooms and vending machines and other kids to play with. A visitors center we soon noticed had a chain-link fence around it and a propped-up sign gloating, &#8220;Closed for Renovations.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Look, an abandoned castle!&#8221; I tried, failing.</p> \n\n<p>We called AAA Roadside Assistance and waited. Turkeys cook faster. An hour and 40 minutes passed as my iPod faded from Gaga to gone and the sun sank deep into the lake. The battery on our cell phone now dead, our world turned pitch black and eerie quiet.</p> \n\n<p>When our Triple-A savior finally arrived on the scene, I could have jumped for joy. Instead, I froze. The white knight who showed up for our rescue turned out to be a physical composite of every high school bully I ever suffered: a tattooed skinhead-type, complete with soul-deadening stare and missing front tooth.</p> \n\n<p>I hesitantly approached the massive flatbed tow truck idling before me and handed up my membership card through the cab window. Barely looking up, he grunted, &#8220;You know we only tow free for seven miles. After that it&#8217;s 10 bucks a mile. You got about 15 miles to the next town.&#8221; I asked if he could fit a family of four in his cab. His shrug said he&#8217;d manage.</p> \n\n<p>After finishing his paperwork in silence, he finally lumbered down from his cab and stopped, getting his first, long look at my family. He stared at Kelly, then at me, then at our kids, finally speaking in the slow, guttural tones of a wife beater:</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;These kids y&#8217;all&#8217;s?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>We answered that yes, they were.</p> \n\n<p>Traveling as a two-dad family can have its challenges. Twice a year we visit my parents in South Carolina, a state so welcoming that its constitution bans not only same-sex marriage and civil unions but birth control and bagels. On its face, California might seem an improvement, until you find yourself stranded in the dark off I-5 in one of those counties where Prop 8 passed with 98 percent of the vote.</p> \n\n<p>This man, whom I had now cast as the bastard love child of Ned Beatty and his horny hillbilly in the sequel to Deliverance, stared at us for what seemed a heart-thumping forever. Then he moved off. He spent the next few minutes hauling out huge, heavy chains with giant metal hooks. In my mind I pictured him encircling them around Kelly and me after he&#8217;d shot us, to more easily sink us to the bottom of that all-too-convenient lake.</p> \n\n<p>After attaching the giant hooks to our Odyssey &#8212; of course, to complete our family portrait and ensure our suspect status, we were two men driving a minivan &#8212; he moved to the side of his flatbed and began pulling mysterious levers that caused his vehicle to groan as it slowly tipped its flatbed to meet our homosexual automobile.</p> \n\n<p>This was too much for our youngest, James, a boy so Bam-Bam butch that for years we&#8217;ve referred to him as God&#8217;s joke on the gay daddies. By now he truly was jacked up by the adventure of it all. Biologically drawn to the smell of metal and grease like a moth to a blowtorch, James pushed forward and started peppering our AAA guy with questions: &#8220;Is our car dead?&#8221; &#8220;Do you have a bathroom in your truck?&#8221; &#8220;Who knocked out your tooth? Was it Batman?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>At this point Kelly intervened: &#8220;James, stay back so he can do his work.&#8221; Mr. Triple-A stopped what he was doing and looked at us. &#8220;His name&#8217;s James? I got a boy named James.&#8221; He had six kids, he informed us, all named after famous people in the Bible. Of course you do, I thought. A home movie began unspooling in my mind, starring a toddler Moses and barefoot Bathsheba helping their brother Goliath blow up frogs by sticking firecrackers up their butts.</p> \n\n<p>Then he did something unexpected, something&#8230; perfect. This man whose menacing silence and sidelong glances had me rattled took off his work gloves and asked James to hold out his hands. He then began to gently pull the huge, oil-stained gloves over our son&#8217;s tiny fingers. Next he asked if James wanted to help him work the levers on the side of the flatbed so that he could haul our minivan up onto the truck. Mute with awe, James could only nod. As the chains grew taut and our car began to make its slow ascent up the ramp, James&#8217; eyes widened to the size of the moon that had finally peeked through the clouds overhead.</p> \n\n<p>Before long we were all crowded into the cab of the tow truck for the ride to the nearest town. I never would have thought it possible, but somehow the five of us fit. My family was safe. Jesse &#8212; he had a Biblical name, too &#8212; pulled out his phone and handed it to us so we could see pictures of his family. As the glow from the faces of his wife and kids lit up the inside of the truck, he looked at Kelly and me and said, &#8220;So&#8230; did you guys get married when y&#8217;all had that little window a few years back, before the Prop 8 thing?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>We said that we did. &#8220;That&#8217;s good,&#8221; he said. &#8220;My mom did, too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She called up me and my brother and sister and told us, &#8216;Me and Maggie&#8217;s gonna have a wedding. You got a week and a half to figure out a way to get here.&#8217;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>From there on out, this man I was so sure I had pegged continued to upend my preconceived notions. When he learned we live in Hollywood, he told us that as a teenager he&#8217;d been bused in from the suburbs, commuting 20 hours a week to attend the Hollywood High magnet program in theater arts. Theater arts?</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Yep, it was great. For P.E. we took dance. Spent English readin&#8217; Shakespeare. Instead of shop, we built sets for musicals. I loved it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He never charged us the $80 he should have for the extra mileage. Instead, he directed us to the one motel in that truck-stop town that had a swimming pool for the kids. Then he advised us which mechanic to see the next morning and which taco stands to avoid. And before lowering our big, gay minivan into the parking lot of the auto shop, he stopped to put his gloves on our daughter so she could work the levers this time, sending her into a spiral of rapture. After that he offered to drive us to our motel.</p> \n\n<p>After we&#8217;d said our goodbyes and settled into our room, we made sure to sit the kids down and tell them how lucky our family had been that Jesse was the one sent to help us. Being kids, they got it: somehow the five of us fit.</p> \n\n<p>After Kelly and the kids fell asleep, I got curious and Googled the name Jesse. Turns out it&#8217;s Hebrew for &#8220;God&#8217;s gift.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Spilled Milk chronicles Bill&#8217;s misadventures in Daddyland.

This means that construction in the 149 existing Israeli settlements throughout the West Bank that are strangling Palestinians, including the settlements on our village&#8217;s land, will continue unchecked. Olmert&#8217;s cynical announcement underlines our fear that Israel, with US support, will insist on retaining most West Bank settlements in the upcoming negotiations, locking Palestinians into a &#8220;separate but unequal&#8221; position.</p> \n\n<p>When United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice&#8217;s visited the Middle East a few weeks ago, people from our small village of Bil&#8217;in joined neighboring villages to send her a message. We protested peacefully against a West Bank highway near us that is reserved for Jewish Israeli settlers, and off-limits to Palestinians, though it was built on Palestinian land. Our banner read: &#8220;Condi, What would Rosa Parks do?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>We know that Dr. Rice experienced the bitter taste of discrimination growing up in the South during the US civil rights struggle. In Bil&#8217;in, we&#8217;ve drawn inspiration from the US civil rights movement as we&#8217;ve carried out a three year nonviolent resistance campaign against the discriminatory policies of Israel&#8217;s military occupation.</p> \n\n<p>We share Dr. Rice&#8217;s admiration for the courage of Rosa Parks who was arrested in Alabama, Rice&#8217;s home state, for refusing to give her bus seat to a white man. As Palestinians we aren&#8217;t even allowed in buses on many roads in our own country, because 200 miles of the best West Bank roads are reserved for Israeli Jewish settlers.1 The color of Palestinian license plates is different from the licenses of Israelis. Palestinian plates are not allowed on most of the highways crisscrossing the West Bank, many of which were built with US government funding. Palestinians have been banned for five years now from Highway 443 where we protested.</p> \n\n<p>According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), there are 561 physical obstacles and checkpoints inside the West Bank restricting Palestinian movement within the West Bank2, in comparison with only eight checkpoints which separate the West Bank from Israel proper. Nearly all the obstacles and checkpoints are located along the West Bank roads reserved for Israelis. This makes getting to the hospital, school and work or visiting relatives painstakingly difficult or impossible for us. This fragmentation of the West Bank has devastated our economy.</p> \n\n<p>For Palestinians, accepting a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on just 22% of our historic homeland was already a dramatic compromise. But President Bush promised Israel in 2004 that in any negotiated agreement with the Palestinians Israel would retain its &#8220;already existing major population centers&#8221; in the West Bank.</p> \n\n<p>However, all Israeli settlements are illegal under international law. By annexing to Israel strategically located clusters of settlements, or &#8220;settlement blocs&#8221;, and their highways which carve Palestinian areas into isolated enclaves, Israel will gain permanent control of our movement, borders, water, and cut us off from Jerusalem.</p> \n\n<p>The Israeli organization Peace Now reported a few weeks ago that the population growth rate in the settlements is three times the growth rate within Israel.3 We&#8217;re experiencing such rapid settlement construction around Bil&#8217;in and throughout the West Bank that I can&#8217;t even find an accurate map of the West Bank for my son.</p> \n\n<p>In 2001, Israeli developers began building settlement homes on land seized from Bil&#8217;in, calling them a neighborhood of the Modi&#8217;in Illit settlement bloc. Four years later, Israel&#8217;s segregation wall separated Bil&#8217;in from 50% of our agricultural land under the pretext of protecting this new settlement. In response, we held over 200 nonviolent protests together with Israeli and international supporters.</p> \n\n<p>Hundreds of us were injured and arrested. After our protests, Israel&#8217;s Supreme Court ruled that the wall&#8217;s route in Bil&#8217;in must be changed to return around half of our seized land. Though we celebrated this success, Israel continues to build on our land that wasn&#8217;t returned and plans to annex it as part of the Modi&#8217;in Illit settlement bloc.4</p> \n\n<p>Israel has already de facto annexed the 10.2% of the West Bank that lies between the Green Line and the segregation wall, including the major settlement blocs and 80% of Israel&#8217;s 450,000 settlers. The segregation wall, settlements and settlement roads carve Palestinian areas into isolated enclaves.</p> \n\n<p>We pray that our children will not spend their lives under Israeli military occupation. We hope that the Annapolis meeting will bring our dreams of freedom closer to fulfillment. But we are concerned that if Israel is allowed to keep most of its settlements and the roads that connect them, then the existing system of &#8220;separate but unequal&#8221; will be cemented in place in a Palestinian state.</p> \n\n<p>MOHAMMED KHATIB is a leading member of Bilin&#8217;s Popular Committee Against the Wall and the secretary of its village council.</p> \n\n<p>[1] <a href=\"http://imeu.net/engine/uploads/forbidden_roads_-_israels_discriminatory_road_regime_in_the_west_bank.pdf\" type=\"external\">Forbidden roads: The discriminatory West Bank road regime</a>, B&#8217;Tselem.

It's surprising, therefore, to learn that roughly 1 million taxpayers are set to forgo refunds from the 2013 tax year. According to a March 1 statement, the Internal Revenue Service is sitting on as much as $1 billion in total refunds for unfiled 2013 returns. If you're among the million Americans who stand to collect, now's the time to get that old return in -- before it's too late.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Generally speaking, you're supposed to file a tax return each year in time for the deadline, which, for 2017, is April 18. (Yes, you get a few extra days this year.) That said, you technically have a three-year window to claim a refund, which means that if you've yet to file your 2013 return, you still have over a month to do so. Once that April 18 deadline passes, however, you'll no longer have an opportunity to get at that money, at which point it will go straight to the U.S. Treasury instead.</p> \n\n<p>IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.</p> \n\n<p>All in, the IRS says it could owe up to $1 billion in total refunds for the 2013 tax year. Though the median estimated refund varies by state, it ranges from $619 in Idaho to $917 in Alaska. (Note that these figures apply to federal, not state, refunds.)</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Now if you're worried that filing your 2013 tax return three years late will result in a penalty that wipes out any potential refund and then some, fear not. There's no penalty for filing a return after the deadline if the IRS owes you money. Rather, it's the opposite situation you need to worry about.</p> \n\n<p>If you owe the IRS money and are late filing your return, you could face a penalty equal to 5% of the taxes you owe for every month your return is late, up to a maximum of 25%. And if you owe money and file your return more than 60 days after the deadline, you'll face a minimum penalty of $135 or 100% of your unpaid tax bill, whichever is smaller. But again, if you're the one who's owed money, you won't be penalized for getting your return in late.</p> \n\n<p>Now keep in mind that if you've also yet to file your 2014 and 2015 returns, your 2013 tax refund may be withheld by the IRS until you get those forms in. Additionally, if you're due a refund from 2013 but owe the IRS money from another tax year, that 2013 refund will first be applied to whatever balance you have outstanding. The same holds true if you're delinquent on a federal student loan or child support payment -- you won't get that money in hand, but instead, it will be used to offset your obligations. But if it's just that 2013 return you neglected to file and you are due a refund, you should have no problems collecting your money in full.</p> \n\n<p>Failing to file a tax return at any time could mean losing out on a pretty sizable refund, and this especially holds true if you're a lower earner. Each year, an estimated 20% of eligible filers miss out on the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which this year could be worth up to $6,318 depending on your earnings and the number of qualifying children in your household.</p> \n\n<p>Back in 2013, the EITC was worth as much as $6,044, and the income thresholds to qualify were as follows:</p> \n\n<p>DATA SOURCE: IRS.</p> \n\n<p>Note that these limits have since increased, which means that if you currently earn slightly more than what you're seeing above, you may still qualify for the 2016 tax year.</p> \n\n<p>If you're among the many Americans who failed to submit a 2013 return (or a 2014 or 2015 return, for that matter), you should know that it isn't too late to file those forms and get your hands on some much-needed cash. It's a far better alternative than donating that money to the U.S. Treasury and permanently kissing it goodbye.</p> \n\n<p>The $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings.

Look no further than the document above, a letter from Earhart to her future husband George Putnam.</p> \n\n<p>You&#8217;ll remember Earhart became famous as the first female aviator to fly a solo transatlantic flight, redefining expectations of women along the way. Then, she tragically disappeared during a flight in 1937 (only to reappear in a <a href=\"http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/movies/23amelia.html?_r=0\" type=\"external\">&#8220;carefully scrubbed&#8221;</a> <a href=\"http://movies.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/movies/23amelia.html?_r=0\" type=\"external\">and &#8220;exasperatingly dull&#8221; movie</a> in which she was played by Hilary Swank, but that&#8217;s for another post).</p> \n\n<p>Of course, we love her anyway for her courage and fierceness, and even moreso having stumbled upon this priceless prenup agreement. Reading through the document, one thing becomes very clear: this woman had a clear sense of what she wanted out of a marriage. And I find much of her marital vision compelling, even today.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Earhart first expresses some trepidation about getting married at all (&#8220;You must know again my reluctance to marry&#8230;&#8221;) for fear of derailing her career, which &#8220;means most&#8221; to her. Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but this kind of agonizing over work-life balance sounds like a <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/07/why-women-still-cant-have-it-all/309020/\" type=\"external\">distinctly familiar dilemma</a> to the modern feminist. Earhart goes on to give the rough outline of an open marriage (&#8220;I shall not hold you to any midaeval [sic] code of faithfulness&#8221; and emphasizes rather than monogamy a goal of &#8220;finding happiness together&#8221;, on which she finds the marriage to be contingent.</p> \n\n<p>Surely there are a lot of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/24/feminist-wedding-jessica-valenti\" type=\"external\">modern day feminists</a> who can relate to Earhart&#8217;s sentiments about marriage.

Students either earn career and technical certification or transition into a university. Bernie Rhinerson believes it is the job of the community colleges and its board of trustees to secure the connections between the education provided and the students&#8217; next step.</p> \n\n<p>Bernie Rhinerson is a candidate for the <a href=\"http://sdccd.edu/public/district/\" type=\"external\">San Diego Community College District</a> (SDCCD) Board of Trustees. He highlights his priority for community colleges in <a href=\"http://www.smartvoter.org/2012/06/05/ca/sd/vote/rhinerson_b/paper1.html\" type=\"external\">his ballot statement</a>:</p> \n\n<p>Completion of an A.A. or A.S. degree must lead to placement in a four year college or university. Our career technical programs must also be linked to real world job opportunities.&amp;#160;This extremely difficult economy is not the time to cut back on access to critically needed education and job training.</p> \n\n<p>Rhinerson sees two of the biggest challenges facing SDCCD as completion rates and funding. He explains how he would take on those challenges:</p> \n\n<p>To increase completion rates, I support the recommendations of the <a href=\"http://www.californiacommunitycolleges.cccco.edu/PolicyInAction/StudentSuccessTaskForce.aspx\" type=\"external\">Student Success Task Force</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.sdccd.edu/public/administration/carroll.shtml\" type=\"external\">Chancellor Dr. Constance Carrol</a> participated in. These recommendations would make substantive changes to student assessments, registration policies and other policies that will help students make progress on their educational plans and help move them toward a degree and skills certifications.</p> \n\n<p>Bernie Rhinerson is&amp;#160;referring&amp;#160;to the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Student Success Act</a>, which was signed by Governor Jerry Brown in&amp;#160;September. The bill is for increasing effective matriculation to make sure students understand the requirements for completion.</p> \n\n<p>On the issue of funding, Rhinerson says he &#8220;will be a strong advocate for public education funding.&#8221; He is a proponent of Governor Jerry Brown&#8217;s initiative Proposition 30. Mr. Rhinerson stresses the return of investment when governments invest in education:</p> \n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.collegecampaign.org/index.php/download_file/view/737/91/\" type=\"external\">recent study by the Campaign for College Opportunity</a> shows that for every dollar that California invests in students who graduate, the state will receive a net benefit on that investment of four dollars and fifty cents. Education is a great investment for our state.</p> \n\n<p>The race for the community college board is not a highly publicized contest. Candidates who seek to represent educational institutions do not have the same resources as politicians.

Most Americans are insured either through the government or through their employer. The individual market is where everyone else purchases health insurance, and does so on their own. And this is the market most affected (and decimated) by ObamaCare.</p> \n\n<p>On and off, throughout the last 15 years, it has been through the individual market that I have purchased my own health coverage. This means that I am quite familiar with the damage ObamaCare has done to those stuck in this market, most of whom are not poor enough for Medicaid -- which means they come from the working and middle class. Boiled down, ObamaCare has become a cruel tax on working people, who are now forced by their government to pay an enormous sum of money for what is now a nearly useless product.</p> \n\n<p>Prior to ObamaCare the individual market was far from perfect. You could be denied coverage for any number of reasons, including a pre-existing condition. I was once denied coverage for refusing to take a prescription drug with flu-like side effects.</p> \n\n<p>Even before ObamaCare, one of the individual market's biggest setbacks was a lack of competition. Because our government is corrupt, insurers were and are still not allowed to sell their product across state lines (Trump wants to remedy this, God bless him). This dramatically shrinks the market to within the individual state, which in turn means less competition for insurers, which in turn means higher prices and an increased amount of dickish corporate behavior.</p> \n\n<p>Nevertheless, despite its wild imperfections, I was always able to purchase coverage at a reasonable price. Other than a bad lower back, for a 50 year-old guy I'm in good health. For this reason, I would always purchase what was called a \"catastrophic plan\" -- a policy with a $6000 to $10,000 deductible for anywhere from $150 to $225 a month.</p> \n\n<p>Catastrophic plans were not just good for me personally, they were good for the entire health care system. What you had were millions of people insured in case of a dire health emergency, like a car crash or cancer, but otherwise doing something no one else does: treating the healthcare industry like a free market.</p> \n\n<p>Somewhere around 90% of insured Americans do NOT treat the health care industry like a free market. Because someone else is paying for their health services (an insurance company), no one prices anything. Therefore, unlike every other product and service in America, health care providers are not under any pressure from customers when it comes to cost.</p> \n\n<p>The perfect example of this is to look at the respective cost curves of medical procedures that are and are not covered by insurance. It is no secret that overall health care costs have exploded, and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/06/21/health-care-rising-costs/\" type=\"external\">done so well ahead of inflation</a> (this is another broken ObamaCare promise). And yet, like plasma televisions and Bluray players, the cost of medical procedures not covered by insurance, like Lasik and plastic surgeries, have decreased. I can also tell you from personal experience that eye exams and glasses are much cheaper than they used to be. My annual flu shot, which is now available at the local CVS or Walgreens, is a mere $25, or about 1/10th of what a doctor visit for a flu shot would cost your insurance company.</p> \n\n<p>Once you are outside of the insurance market, you also discover that even insured services are cheaper. Since I now pay everything out of pocket, everything is cheaper. My doctors charge much less for visits and my prescriptions are actually cheaper than what my co-pay cost when I was insured. I once called around pricing an MRI, something an insured person would never do, and the prices ranged from $2500 to $400. Guess who got my business.</p> \n\n<p>At the risk of putting too fine a point on this, imagine the cost of a brake job or oil change if we insured our car repairs like we do our health. The whole idea of health insurance, outside of a catastrophic illness, is not only stupid, it's exploding costs.</p> \n\n<p>And what did ObamaCare do? It outlawed these wonderful catastrophic plans. I'm not sure how such an act is Constitutional in a free country, but that's for another column. What I do know is that rather than enjoying access to tailor-made insurance plans, every American is now required to purchase a comprehensive plan. Under ObamaCare, although I am a 50 year-old male, I must pay <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2014/03/13/obamacare-charges-millions-of-unsuspecting-americans-for-coverage-theyll-never-use/#7bbb1a95173c\" type=\"external\">for pre-natal care, maternity care, etc.</a></p> \n\n<p>The best comparison to drive home how absurdly ridiculous this is, is to have you imagine the government passing a law that requires everyone to purchase, not just a car, but a Cadillac.</p> \n\n<p>Now that the backfill is complete, let me explain my headline. Here is how ObamaCare is nothing more than a cruel tax on the working and middle class.</p> \n\n<p>Tax #1 - Health care costs have increased dramatically for everyone</p> \n\n<p>Thanks to the failure of ObamaCare, the cost of everyone's healthcare is exploding. Everyone. Not just those in the individual market. If you recall, President LiarMcFailure and his fact-checking media promised us health care costs would decrease by $2500 a year under ObamaCare. The reality is that, in many cases, costs have actually increased by that much. That's a tax.</p> \n\n<p>ObamaCare defenders will argue that costs were increasing prior to ObamaCare, which is true. But not by this much.</p> \n\n<p>Tax #2 - ObamaCare premium explosion</p> \n\n<p>Even before the newest rate increases of around 20% go into <a href=\"http://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article80879447.html\" type=\"external\">effect next year</a>, the cost of my monthly premiums more than doubled to $450 a month. What's especially maddening is that the deductible is still an obnoxiously high $4000 - $5000.</p> \n\n<p>What this means, essentially, is that I'm paying for a Cadillac health insurance plan that I'll never use.</p> \n\n<p>That's a tax -- a huge tax, a massive tax.</p> \n\n<p>Granted, I never used the catastrophic plan, but that premium was much lower and I was not mandated by our corrupt government to purchase it.</p> \n\n<p>ObamaCare defenders will argue that, thanks to government subsidies, many ObamaCare recipients won't pay a price increase. So what? Taxpayers still have to pay for the subsidy.</p> \n\n<p>Tax #3 - You're paying more for an increasingly awful service</p> \n\n<p>Even with that obnoxious restriction that wouldn&#8217;t allow insurance companies to sell across state lines, each state still had a number of companies to choose from. But now that ObamaCare is decimating the individual marketplace, insurance companies are fleeing the individual market, which means that companies you once could purchase insurance from prior to ObamCare, you no longer can. The government has chased them completely out of business.</p> \n\n<p>In most every state, the number of providers is shrinking, your choices as a consumer are decreasing by the year. In the entire state of New Jersey, you have only two insurance companies to choose from.</p> \n\n<p>Tax #4 - The ObamaCare penalty</p> \n\n<p>You're a freeborn American. You look at the choices offered by ObamaCare. You decide that paying $5000 a year for a lousy policy you will never use is madness. You choose not to purchase health insurance and instead choose to pay out of your own pocket for whatever medical needs you and your family might need.</p> \n\n<p>Too bad.</p> \n\n<p>That choice is now outlawed.</p> \n\n<p>If you make that choice, you will be taxed 2.5% of your annual income.</p> \n\n<p>Tax #5 - The deficit</p> \n\n<p>The ObamaCare boondoggle is costing taxpayers tens <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/10/17/now-there-can-be-no-doubt-obamacare-will-increase-the-deficit/#6bfb062953d1\" type=\"external\">of millions of dollars</a> a year in deficit spending. Because the Boomers and their spawn are too selfish to live within their means, their bill will be paid for by our children and grandchildren.</p> \n\n<p>That's a tax.</p> \n\n<p>--</p> \n\n<p>Fewer choices. A worse product. Double the cost.</p> \n\n<p>Those of us opposed to ObamaCare warned of this in advance, and for our trouble the mainstream media labeled us racist.</p> \n\n<p>P.S.

Kaki Hockersmith, the Clintons&#8217; designer, feverishly replaced dozens of yards of Bush blue curtains with gold silk swags and brought back the 1880 Resolute Desk used by John F. Kennedy from storage. Fort Worth designer Ken Blasingame swapped out the Clinton Oval Office rug for the Reagan Oval Office rug, because George W. Bush preferred the way the presidential seal was depicted on it, and a painting of western horse riders, &#8220;A Charge to Keep&#8221; by W.H.D. Koerner was hung.</p> \n\n<p>But Smith made only one, symbolic, change that day: He replaced the traditional formal flower arrangement on the coffee table with a wooden bowl of fresh apples.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The world was in crisis,&#8221; Smith says. &#8220;This wasn&#8217;t the time to do anything major.&#8221; He spent most of his time making the Obama girls&#8217; rooms comfortable and welcoming. &#8220;Outside you could see huge crowds, but inside you couldn&#8217;t hear anything. I was making up beds,&#8221; Smith says, &#8220;but I knew I was in the eye of the storm.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>As Donald and Melania Trump and the rest of the new first family prepare to check out their new digs after he is sworn in as the 45th president, speculation has been rampant &#8211; and facts sparse &#8211; on who has been helping them plan their move-in.</p> \n\n<p>Although the Trumps have not made public who their designer or designers are, immediate changes are sure to be coming to the Oval Office and private quarters. Donald Trump is extremely image-conscious: He reportedly is very involved with architects and designers for his various hotels, condos and office buildings and knows his way around high-end fixtures (preferably gold) and fabrics.</p> \n\n<p>Style at this White House may be like no other. Consider the current Trump addresses: a glittering jewel-box penthouse of gilded fanciness atop New York&#8217;s Trump Tower and private apartments in the palatial Palm Beach landmark Mar-a-Lago. Then there&#8217;s the private 757 plane with 24-karat gold-plated seat-belt buckles and bedroom pillows featuring the Trump family crest. Since the Trump Organization headquarters and Trump&#8217;s Manhattan penthouse home are both in Trump Tower, he is already living above his office and walking to work, as he will presumably be doing at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW.</p> \n\n<p>In a 2015 interview in People magazine, Trump said, &#8220;If I were elected, I would maybe touch it up a little bit, but the White House is a special place.&#8221; He added, &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to do too much touching.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>As well as being the house of the president, the White House serves as an office, a venue for constant receptions and high-profile dinners, and a museum of American history, full of valuable antiques and paintings. It is constantly undergoing renovation and preservation, not surprising for any house dating from 1800.</p> \n\n<p>At noon on Jan. 20 after the swearing-in, the carefully choreographed change of occupants will begin. The Trumps have been working with White House Chief Usher Angella Reid and White House Curator Bill Allman on details.</p> \n\n<p>At some point, the Trumps will get a briefing about who pays the bills. Part of the funds Congress appropriates for repair and restoration of the White House is a redecorating allowance of $100,000. This money is earmarked for the private quarters. The Obamas and other recent presidents declined the allowance, preferring to use their own money or private funds.</p> \n\n<p>The White House Historical Association, a nonprofit educational institution, provides money for projects from two sources: the White House Endowment Trust, used for public rooms and conserving collections, and the White House Acquisition Trust, used to acquire fine and decorative arts.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Changes to the first floor, called the State Floor, and the ground floor, which contain the State Dining Room, Green Room, Blue Room and others, are made in consultation with the White House curator&#8217;s office and the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, an advisory group established by Lyndon Johnson in 1964. The committee is a group of experts, including several ex officio members, and others appointed by the president, who are tasked with preserving the &#8220;museum quality&#8221; of White House public spaces. The president traditionally appoints his own decorator to this committee.</p> \n\n<p>Meanwhile, it&#8217;s up to the president and his designers to decide what to put into the Oval Office, the room most associated with the presidency.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Everyone now personalizes it,&#8221; says William Seale, a historian who has written books about the White House. &#8220;They usually don&#8217;t change much right away. But then they might change the curtains, and everyone eventually gets a new rug.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The designers who have worked with presidential families all have their stories of how they were able to accomplish everything.</p> \n\n<p>Blasingame says he moved into a third-floor White House bedroom on the Monday after the inauguration and spent 10 days getting things organized and comfortable for the Bushes. The first time he walked into the Oval Office he began playing a video in his mind of the news conferences and addresses to the nation that would take place there. &#8220;It was so impressive,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I was just doing my job, but I was participating in something so historic.&#8221; He always stuck to the presidential dress code when working on the Oval Office. &#8220;Since President Bush wanted everyone to wear a coat and tie when they entered the Oval Office, I did the same,&#8221; says Blasingame. &#8220;No jeans.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Everyone wondered how Kaki Hockersmith, the Clintons&#8217; designer from Little Rock, could make such sweeping changes in one day. She says it was because then-first lady Barbara Bush &#8220;was very generous and gave us a lot of access in advance.&#8221; But on Inauguration Day, she had to hustle to get to the White House and supervise all the installations she had planned. &#8220;Hillary Clinton insisted that I come to the swearing-in and she said she would arrange to get me back to the White House as soon as possible. She told us to go to a certain corner across from the Capitol and look for a military officer in a van. We were then cleared to go through every barricade throughout the parade route. And, oh, my God, people would see the vehicle and start waving at us. I will never forget that ride.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The design world is waiting to see which decorator the Trumps will choose and is hunting for clues as to what it might look like. There aren&#8217;t many photos of the Trump penthouse, originally decorated in the 1980s by the late Angelo Donghia, but more gold has shown up over the years. Margaret Russell, longtime design editor, went to the penthouse in the 1980s when Donald Trump was still married to his first wife, Ivana. &#8220;What I can see from recent photos is that not much has changed,&#8221; says Russell. &#8220;It&#8217;s very ornate, very detailed. I believe I recall cherubim on the ceiling.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Mar-a-Lago, Trump&#8217;s exotic Palm Beach property, was built between 1923 and 1927 by cereal heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, who also owned Washington&#8217;s Hillwood estate. Its lavish rooms had the look of European castles and palaces, layered in gold leaf and dripping in crystal chandeliers. Post left her villa to the federal government in 1973 to use as a presidential retreat, but the government deemed it too expensive. Trump bought the house and furnishings in 1985. He and his family used it until 1995, when Trump reopened it as a private club, keeping their own private quarters. Wood paneling, pink marble, gold-leaf ceilings and most of the original architecture remain.</p> \n\n<p>The Trumps clearly are used to living in large houses with staff. But the White House is like no other house in the world. &#8220;You move there under public scrutiny and you have probably not seen much of where you are going to live,&#8221; says Betty Monkman, former White House curator. &#8220;When you walk onto the State Floor, the world is watching. It&#8217;s a big adjustment for any family to move in there.&#8221;</p>", "title": "When Donald Trump gets sworn in, the White House is in line for a decorating update", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/931191/when-donald-trump-gets-sworn-in-the-white-house-is-in-line-for-a-decorating-update.html", "published_at": "2017-01-19", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Preschool-aged children who are extremely selective about what they eat and dislike even being near certain foods are more likely than others to have underlying anxiety or depression, the study found.

These are children who will only eat a narrow range of foods. Kids with either level of pickiness were almost two times more likely than others to develop anxiety symptoms within two years, the study found.</p> \n\n<p>More typical pickiness, including kids who just refuse to eat their vegetables, is probably merely \"normal dislike,\" said eating disorders specialist Nancy Zucker, the lead author and an associate psychiatry professor at Duke University's medical school.

Trump argued that the law made U.S. businesses less competitive. Trump&#8217;s Secretary of State, and former ExxonMobil CEO, had a different point of view, arguing that accepting&amp;#160;bribes would only weaken the standing of these companies.</p> \n\n<p>&#8216;Tillerson disagreed. When he was an executive with Exxon, he told Trump, he once met with senior officials in Yemen to discuss a deal. At the meeting, Yemen&#8217;s oil minister handed him his business card. On the back was written an account number at a Swiss bank. &#8220;Five million dollars,&#8221; the minister told him.</p> \n\n<p>&#8216;&#8220;I don&#8217;t do that,&#8221; Tillerson said. &#8220;Exxon doesn&#8217;t do that.&#8221; If the Yemenis wanted Exxon on the deal, he said, they&#8217;d have to play straight. A month later, the Yemenis assented. &#8220;Tillerson told Trump that America didn&#8217;t need to pay bribes&#8212;that we could bring the world up to our own standards,&#8221; a source with knowledge of the exchange told me.&#8217;</p> \n\n<p>Prior to becoming president, Trump managed a large international business, so it is likely he has dealt with these laws before.

Worse yet, it was a large decline when compared to last year's first-quarter result of $0.23 per share.</p> \n\n<p>In addition to earnings checking in lower than expected, revenue increased 8%, with comparable sales moving 4% higher. This generally would be a silver lining for investors, but the expectations for those metrics were higher, as well. Management was quick to point to headwinds caused by the negative impact of energy and currency on the markets, but also internal issues with supply-chain problems.</p> \n\n<p>All in all, the disappointing quarter led management to reduce its full-year EPS guidance by $0.90 to $1.00, down to a full-year total EPS of between $1.60 and $1.80. This is below analysts' estimates of $2.66.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Restoration Hardware's stock price has dropped 66% in 2016 alone, and value investors looking to swoop in should weigh the risks and rewards.

That offer values the shares at $37 each, which was a hefty premium to the stock's closing price on Monday -- hence, the 67% jump for the week.</p> \n\n<p>\"This highly strategic and complementary transaction will enhance Zimmer Biomet's innovation leadership in musculoskeletal healthcare by adding a premier spine platform to our portfolio of solutions,\" said Zimmer Biomet CEO David Dvorak, in a press release.</p> \n\n<p>The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016, and Zimmer Biomet expects the acquisition to accelerate the future growth of its total business. Management will update its revenue guidance to reflect the acquisition when the deal closes.

However, there are many approaches a company can take when delivering employee feedback. One&amp;#160;growing option is&amp;#160;360-degree feedback.</p> \n\n<p>When you first hear the term \" <a href=\"http://engagiant.com/blog/the-importance-of-continuous-feedback-in-change-management/\" type=\"external\">360-degree feedback Opens a New Window.</a>,\" you may feel&amp;#160;overwhelmed. It can be a lot of information to handle, and it may sound complicated. Getting your employees used to a 360-degree review process may also take a little effort, but it will ultimately be worth it.</p> \n\n<p>Here are the basics when it comes to&amp;#160;360-degree feedback success:</p> \n\n<p>Understanding 360-Degree Feedback</p> \n\n<p>When it comes down to it, 360-degree feedback is exactly what it sounds like &#8211; feedback from around the circle. It is a system or process in which an employee&amp;#160;receives feedback from multiple sources. These sources are typically colleagues, direct reports, and managers. A&amp;#160;360-degree review will often also include some form of self-evaluation. The goal of this process is to allow the entire team to help each other develop skills and address any potential weaknesses.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>There are multiple&amp;#160;benefits when transitioning to a 360-degree feedback system,&amp;#160;including the following:</p> \n\n<p>1. Open Channels Of Communication</p> \n\n<p>Adopting the 360-degree feedback system allows employees in the company to comment on each other's work. This fosters a communication-rich environment in which it is easy to address and resolve problems.</p> \n\n<p>The overall communication process is improved, and issues that could potentially cause problems are often solved before they cause any damage. Effective communication makes an organization&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.roomtoescape.com/blog/12-statistics-that-show-the-importance-of-effective-corporate-team-building\" type=\"external\">4.5 times more likely Opens a New Window.</a> to retain its&amp;#160;best employees.</p> \n\n<p>2. Better Feedback From Multiple Sources</p> \n\n<p>Receiving feedback from peers, supervisors, and oneself allows for a more well-rounded and substantial review compared to a process that relies on feedback from just one individual. Employees are able to receive feedback more frequently, and peer feedback is just as beneficial as feedback received from superiors. In fact,&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.trakstar.com/blog-post/7-facts-you-need-to-know-before-giving-employee-feedback/\" type=\"external\">88 percent of employees who receive peer feedback are happier with their jobs Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>A 360-degree&amp;#160;review also allows trends and patterns to become clear. For example, let's say an employee is always looking for different ways to help other departments and collaborate. While a supervisor might not have seen any&amp;#160;of this, colleagues from these departments would be able to praise the employee for their hard work. In this case, a 360-degree feedback process allows team members to recognize good work that may have otherwise gone unnoticed.</p> \n\n<p>3. Team Development</p> \n\n<p>The 360-degree feedback approach helps team members work more effectively together. Team members who give each other feedback create a sense of accountability when providing their input on each member's performance. A well-implemented 360-degree system can allow for improved team communication and development. Team communication is important, with <a href=\"http://govitru.com/workplace-statistics/\" type=\"external\">33 percent of employees Opens a New Window.</a> saying a lack of open, honest communication has the most negative impact on employee morale.</p> \n\n<p>4. Career Development</p> \n\n<p>A 360-degree feedback process provides employees with excellent information about what they&amp;#160;need to do in order to further their careers. It also keeps them engaged in their current roles: <a href=\"http://www.businessperform.com/blog/2010/10/05/gallup-employee-feedback-358.html\" type=\"external\">98 percent of employees Opens a New Window.</a> say managers who give them little or no feedback fail to engage them. A 360-degree process gives an employee many opportunities to&amp;#160;learn what they are doing well and how they could improve.</p> \n\n<p>What Are the Downsides of a&amp;#160;360-Degree Review?</p> \n\n<p>For all the benefits, a 360-degree review process also has its downsides. It is important to understand these shortfalls because they can offer us a map of what to avoid when practicing 360-degree reviews.</p> \n\n<p>1. What an Employee Decides to Do After the Process</p> \n\n<p>In order for the 360-degree review process to be successful, an employee must be able to do a few things along the way. It can be overwhelming to receive large amounts of feedback all at once. If the information is to be useful, an employee must be able to understand the feedback, process it, and determine next steps.</p> \n\n<p>Taking a <a href=\"https://engagiant.com/blog/microfeedback-beyond-technology/\" type=\"external\">microfeedback Opens a New Window.</a> approach might be able to help here. Integrating this process into a complete performance management system makes employees accountable for following up and acting on the feedback provided by others.</p> \n\n<p>2. Focusing on What Is Wrong</p> \n\n<p>People tend to focus on the negative remarks rather than the positive during performance reviews. That means many employees focus on fixing their weaknesses. While it is important to address performance shortfalls, employees should also pay attention to the positive aspects of their reviews. Maximizing one's strengths has been shown to be rewarding, and it will certainly advance your team in the right direction.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.clearcompany.com/ignore-these-performance-management-stats-at-your-own-risk\" type=\"external\">A reported 25 percent of employees Opens a New Window.</a> leave organizations due to lack of recognition. Try to emphasize the positives while giving feedback in the 360-degree review process. (Make sure to address weaknesses as well!) Encouraging employees to pursue their strengths will help counteract negative feelings.</p> \n\n<p>3. Sticking to the Process</p> \n\n<p>A 360-degree review is not a one-time event. This process should be implemented on a regular basis. Building a strong feedback culture can help when implementing 360-degree reviews.</p> \n\n<p>Try to make feedback a daily habit. Then, when it comes time for the routine 360-degree feedback, the review process will be easier to implement and employees won't be overwhelmed. Use the feedback to create an action plan, and you will start to see an employee-driven process.</p> \n\n<p>&#8211;</p> \n\n<p>Every performance feedback system has its potential pitfalls, and the 360-degree process is no different. However, it can create a positive and powerful problem-solving environment when carried out correctly.</p> \n\n<p>The 360-degree process can help increase employee engagement, company morale, and productivity levels. Given that only&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://blog.clearcompany.com/ignore-these-performance-management-stats-at-your-own-risk\" type=\"external\">32.5 percent of U.S. employees report Opens a New Window.</a> being engaged at work,&amp;#160;it may be time to take a chance on going 360!</p> \n\n<p>A version of this article originally appeared&amp;#160;on the <a href=\"https://engagiant.com/blog/everything-need-know-going-360/\" type=\"external\">iRev&#252; blog.

There are nine campuses in the Los Angeles Community College District. The \n\n<a href=\"http://www.lamayor.org/la-puts-higher-education-within-reach-all-students\" type=\"external\">mayor&#8217;s office released a statement</a> saying the program will offer students &#8220;resources and support that ranges from tutoring and mentoring programs to financial literacy workshops.&#8221; The program begins with the 2017 class of high school graduates. In order to be eligible, applicants must qualify for California in-state tuition and have submitted FAFSA or California Dream Act applications. Students must attend classes full time in order to remain eligible. On paying for the program: So far, the Mayor&#8217;s Fund for Los Angeles has raised $1.75 million. The mayor&#8217;s office says these funds will &#8220;cover more than half the cost of the first year of LA College Promise.&#8221; In an \n\n<a href=\"http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2016/09/14/lausd-graduates-free-college-tuition/\" type=\"external\">interview with CBS Los Angeles</a>, Garcetti said,&amp;#160;&#8220;We raised enough money privately so no taxpayer money comes from the city of LA, and the community college school district stepped up with the rest of the resources.&#8221; In January 2015, the White House released a proposal to offer \n\n<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/01/09/fact-sheet-white-house-unveils-america-s-college-promise-proposal-tuitio\" type=\"external\">two free years of community college for &#8220;responsible students.&#8221;</a> Scott Svonkin, President of the LACCD Board of Trustees, said LA College Promise was created &#8220;as President Obama envisioned.&#8221; Svonkin also said, &#8220;Our goal is free community college for everyone.&#8221; The announcement makes Los Angeles the largest US city to guarantee&amp;#160;high school graduates at least one tuition-free year of higher education, the mayor&#8217;s office said in a statement. KCRA News reports that the \n\n<a href=\"http://www.kcra.com/news/free-tuition-proposed-for-community-college-students-in-california/37807358\" type=\"external\">average year of tuition for California community college is around $1,100.</a> Because of California grants and other stipends, roughly 65% of community college students pay no tuition, according to KCRA. Mayor Garcetti: \n\n<q> \n <p>&#8220;Higher education should be within reach for every student in Los Angeles. The L.A. College Promise is a path for every Angeleno to earn a high school diploma and pursue the skills and education they need to realize their dreams and potential. When the first Promise students step onto campus next fall, they&#8217;ll be doing more than putting themselves on a launching pad to prosperity &#8212; they&#8217;ll embody a commitment that is fundamental to who we are as a people, and what we want for our future.&#8221;</p> \n</q> Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, who represents California&#8217;s 4oth district: Jon Coupal, \n\n<a href=\"http://www.kcra.com/news/free-tuition-proposed-for-community-college-students-in-california/37807358\" type=\"external\">President of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association said</a>, &#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing as a free lunch &#8212; and there&#8217;s really no such thing as a free education.&#8221; Coupal argues that students take their education &#8220;more seriously&#8221; when they pay for it.

I suggested that we might find something else. I started looking around and found a good bit of concern over kids and energy drinks.&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.redbull.co.uk/faq.action#9\" type=\"external\">Even Red Bull, one of the most popular drink companies, says:</a></p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>It is important to note that children are the only group that we specifically do not target as we believe that they do not need that extra boost of energy (most children already have that natural 'exuberance'!)It is generally considered that products containing caffeine are not particularly suitable for young children. The real problem with this is that it is not possible to categorically state at which age someone is no longer a child in this situation. For example, if a child is already consuming caffeine-based products such as tea, coffee, colas or other energy drinks, there is no real reason why they should not be able to drink Red Bull. However, sensitivity to caffeine is subjective no matter if you are a child or a fully grown adult. One adult person might be able to drink 2-3 cans without getting the same feelings as those associated with drinking too much caffeine, whereas another adult will drink&amp;#160;one can and feel that they shouldn't drink another that day. Caffeine sensitivity is very personalized.</p> \n\n<p>The best guideline we can offer is that if a child already drinks coffee, tea or colas etc., then there is no reason&amp;#160;they shouldn't drink Red Bull. This is the&amp;#160;amount of caffeine in Red Bull (80mg) compared to that of another soft drink (for instance a cola, which contains roughly 33mg of caffeine.) Red Bull therefore contains roughly 2&#189; times the caffeine in a can of cola.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2005/253.html\" type=\"external\">FoodProcessing.com</a> reports:</p> \n\n<p>The two beverage segments (sports drinks and energy drinks) appealed initially to young and active rather than simply \"athletic\" males, but recently have become more popular with women and teenagers.</p> \n\n<p>An <a href=\"http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=102495&amp;amp;catId=100406&amp;amp;tid=100008&amp;amp;p=3\" type=\"external\">Australian consumer group says:</a></p> \n\n<p>Twenty-seven percent&amp;#160;of 8&#8211;12-year-old boys, 12 percent&amp;#160;of 8&#8211;12-year-old girls, 24 percent&amp;#160;of 12&#8211;18-year-old boys and 20 percent&amp;#160;of 12&#8211;18-year-old girls had had at least one energy drink in the two weeks prior to the survey. It's thought that parents may also be buying these drinks for their kids, probably under the misguided assumption that they're better than soft drinks because they're called energy drinks.</p> \n\n<p>These drinks are particularly high in caffeine, and it only takes one or two cans to give kids more than the amount that's been reported to cause increased anxiety. And if they had the 'dosage' recommended for some of the products of five cans a day, they'd also get enough to increase blood pressure and heart rate (and even cause palpitations), along with jitters and possible sleep disturbances. They can also suffer withdrawal symptoms (headaches and lethargy) when they stop taking in caffeine.</p> \n\n<p>The article continues:</p> \n\n<p>A further study found that some teenagers are drinking up to five cans of energy drink before sporting events, believing it will boost their performance. Energy drinks shouldn't be confused with sports drinks, which are designed to maximize hydration. The caffeine content of energy drinks has the opposite effect&amp;#160;-- it dehydrates. At such levels, caffeine can increase diastolic blood pressure and heart rate (sometimes with palpitations) and provoke feelings of anxiety. It would also be enough to disqualify athletes from some formal competition. And while caffeine is known to enhance performance in sport, at levels of about 200&#8211;300 mg, its diuretic effect could be a considerable disadvantage.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tonganoxiemirror.com/section/living/story/7887\" type=\"external\">The Tonganoxie (Kansas)&amp;#160;Mirror</a> did a terrific story on high school athletes who drink this stuff before and even during a game.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jan2005/sb2005015_8196_sb017.htm\" type=\"external\">Business Week says</a> the $2-a-can energy drink market is packed with competitors who are going after the youth market in a big way.</p> \n\n<p>The target market for energy drinks is mostly male teenagers and twentysomethings, a notoriously fickle bunch. So unlike the cola market, where Coke and Pepsi push their offerings to all soda-drinkers, most of the smaller power-drink players have decided that their best hope of gaining traction is by appealing to very specialized market segments. \"Right now there's an ability to get a toehold more quickly if you can build loyalty with a niche of the market,\" says Kelly O'Keefe, CEO of brand-consulting firm Emergence, based in Atlanta. \"The margins are high enough that you can make money on a small run of the product.\" Drinks have been aimed at consumers interested in extreme sports (Red Bull, Go Fast!), video games (Bawls Guarana, which sponsors gaming tournaments and encourages players to pull all-nighters), hip-hop (Crunk!!!, Pimp Juice, and DefCon 3), and even marijuana, courtesy of Merrilville (Ind.)-based brand Bong Water.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.med.umich.edu/psych/sub/maher.htm\" type=\"external\">Maher Karam-Hage</a>, M.D., an addiction specialist at the University of Michigan Health System, raises some concerns about the beverages, particularly when they are mixed with alcohol, ingested before intensive exercise or used by children. \"In the United States, these energy drinks have not had any warnings. In Europe, it's been more cautionary,\" says Karam-Hage, medical director of the Chelsea-Arbor Treatment Center, a joint program of the U-M Health System and Chelsea Community Hospital. He notes that France has banned some of the drinks and other countries have placed restrictions on them. \"In this country, our advertisements for these drinks and the marketing are ahead of the science.\" <a href=\"http://www.redbullusa.com/extras/ingredients.jsp\" type=\"external\">The energy drinks typically contain sugar, caffeine (often 80 mg per can, about the same as a cup of coffee),</a> and taurine, a sulfur-containing amino acid. Some countries have raised concerns about the amount of caffeine in the drinks and the uncertain health effects of taurine. Energy drinks are different from sports drinks, which tend not to have caffeine or taurine and are lower in carbohydrates. While Karam-Hage stops short of saying people never should consume energy drinks, he says that mixing them with alcohol is dangerous and should be avoided. \"The best analogy I can come up with is it's the same as driving a car, putting one foot on the gas and one foot on the brakes,\" he says of combining the stimulants in caffeine and the intoxicating effects of alcohol.</p> \n\n<p>Popping the Gum Market <a href=\"http://www.dfw.com/mld/dfw/living/12064899.htm\" type=\"external\">The (Ft.

Their function is not necessarily in their taste or texture.</p> \n\n<p>Emerging as well are startling and exotic flavors, including a hot and spicy mango-curry gum base just created by a European manufacturer (not yet for sale in the United States), and the limited availability sugar-free chocolate gum by O'lala Foods of Chicago. Gum marketeers also are hoping to capture the attention of kids with more intense flavors, as well as with blended-fruit flavors not found in nature, as in the surprising \"grapermelon\" from Juicy Fruit.</p> \n\n<p>Why the sudden pop of interest in gum? Americans spend $3.3 billion a year on the sticky stuff. About half of us chew gum, and those who choose to chew gnaw an average of 170 pieces a year. But gum sales and snack sales have not been increasing at a rate that pleases producers.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The Plymouth-Canton school board voted unanimously June 28 to consider commercial naming opportunities for everything from the new school to athletic fields to events such as the prom.</p> \n\n<p>It's not exactly a first: A school district in New Jersey sold the naming rights to its high school gymnasium to a local Shop-Rite, while the Grapevine-Colleyville school district in Texas has offered advertising space on school buses, sporting venues and a middle-school roof.</p> \n\n<p>Sponsorship experts say it's hard to pin down a number for naming rights to a school because of the many variables -- size of district and wealth of community, for example -- but officials in Plymouth-Canton said that if they pursued a sponsor they'd seek a 51 percent investment, meaning a marketer would probably have to pony up $7.5 million of the $15 million cost of building the new elementary school.</p> \n\n<p>But replacing George Washington Junior High or Martin Luther King Magnet School with Fed-Ex Elementary or Nike Public School is taking the trend to a new -- and to some, troubling -- stage.</p> \n\n<p>\"What this issue is, first of all, is the way we have abandoned public space and the notion of the public good,\" said psychologist Susan Linn, co-founder of the Boston-based <a href=\"http://www.commercialexploitation.org/\" type=\"external\">Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood</a>. \"People don't see the cost, and the cost is our values and the values we are passing onto children.\"</p> \n\n<p>The story continues:</p> \n\n<p>From the secondary level to the university level there has been a sense that commercialization -- already common on the athletic field, where even pizza magnate Papa John has an eponymous football stadium at the University of Louisville, for instance -- is creeping into the classroom.</p> \n\n<p>In Philadelphia, Temple University is considering selling naming rights to its new $150 million medical school and research facility.

Perry, the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of California&#8217;s anti-gay marriage initiative, Proposition 8. Faith-based groups were on prominent display: the Methodists supporting marriage equality, the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Westboro Baptists</a> suggesting (per usual) that &#8220;God hates fags,&#8221; the Catholics both for and against gay marriage, clergy of all stripes. But one group that wasn&#8217;t there in any official capacity was the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&#8212;a.k.a. the Mormons&#8212;which perhaps more than any other religious group was responsible for getting Prop. 8 passed in the first place.</p> \n\n<p>In the five years since the LDS church sent busloads of the faithful to California to canvass neighborhoods, and contributed more than $20 million via its members to support the initiative, it has all but dropped the rope in the public policy tug of war over marriage equality. The change stems from an even more remarkable if somewhat invisible transformation happening within the church, prompted by the ugly fight over Prop. 8 and the ensuing backlash from the flock.</p> \n\n<p>Although the LDS&#8217;s prophet hasn&#8217;t described a holy revelation directing a revision in church doctrine on same-sex marriage or gay rights in general, the church has shown a rare capacity for introspection and humane cultural change unusual for a large conservative religious organization.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It seems like the [Mormon] hierarchy has pulled the plug and is no longer taking the lead in the fight to stop same-sex marriage,&#8221; says <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Fred Karger</a>, the LGBT activist who first exposed the church&#8217;s major role in the passage of Prop. 8. &#8220;The Mormon Church has lost so many members and suffered such a black eye because of all its anti-gay activities that they really had no choice. I am hopeful that the Catholic Church cannot be far behind.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The LDS church has been a driving force against gay-marriage initiatives since at least 1995. It was instrumental in fending off same-sex marriage in Hawaii and Alaska and, in 2000, it helped pass California&#8217;s Proposition 22 (the Prop. 8 precursor known as the Knight Initiative), which defined marriage as solely between a man and woman. (Prop. 22 was struck down by the California Supreme Court in 2008.)</p> \n\n<p>The church&#8217;s anti-gay positions and lobbying on gay marriage have always been divisive. In 2000, during the fight over the Knight Initiative, a young gay Mormon named Stuart Matis killed himself on the steps of a Mormon ward in Los Altos, California. In a letter to his cousin shortly before his suicide, he despaired over the impact of the church&#8217;s political activities on Mormon families: &#8220;On the night of March 7th, many California couples will retire to their beds thrilled that they helped pass the Knight Initiative. What they don&#8217;t realize is that in the next room, their son or daughter is lying in bed crying and could very well one day be the victim of society&#8217;s homophobia. The Knight Initiative will certainly save no family. It is codified hatred. It is anti-family, anti-love and it is wrong.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But Matis&#8217; death didn&#8217;t slow the church&#8217;s efforts to beat back same-sex marriage initiatives. In 2008, after the California Supreme Court briefly legalized gay marriage in the state, the Latter Day Saints lent their formidable organizing skills and networks to the Prop. 8 effort, sending canvassers door to door by zip code&#8212;sometimes as many as 25,000 per weekend&#8212;much as they send out missionaries to spread the Gospel. The church has been credited with almost single-handedly getting Prop. 8 passed, despite a well-funded opposition with backing from Hollywood.</p> \n\n<p>Prop. 8 was a Pyrrhic victory for the Mormons, however. Their role, which the church sought to keep under wraps, was exposed by Karger, who tracked the individual donations pouring into the Yes on 8 campaign back to church members. LGBT activists responded by publicizing the church&#8217;s involvement, running an ad, for example, showing fake Mormon missionaries knocking on the door of a lesbian couple and then rifling through their drawers and tearing up their marriage license.</p> \n\n<p>The negative exposure prompted protests, and many Mormons publicly renounced their church membership. One of them was then 28-year-old Matthew Lawrence, the son of official LDS pollster Gary Lawrence, who had led the Prop. 8 fight. &#8220;I love my family so much, but it&#8217;s hard to not take this personally. We had a brief falling-out over Prop. 22, but that got mended. But two anti-gay initiatives in eight years, it&#8217;s impossible not to feel attacked,&#8221; Matthew, who is gay, wrote in 2008.</p> \n\n<p>The LDS church had always struggled for public acceptance, and the negative press wasn&#8217;t helping. One poll, conducted a year after Prop. 8 passed, showed that the church&#8217;s favorability rating had fallen from 42 percent to 37 percent. But its image problem was nothing compared to the internal rifts the Mormons were experiencing. &#8220;The church probably deserved the black eye we got from Prop. 8,&#8221; says Mitch Mayne, an openly gay Mormon leader in the San Francisco area. &#8220;What the non-Mormon world didn&#8217;t get to see was how destructive that was inside the faith.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In response to the anger within Mormon ranks over Prop. 8, the president of the Oakland, California, stake (a stake is akin to a Catholic diocese) began organizing&amp;#160;gatherings of gay and straight members to try to bridge the differences. In September 2010, the disgruntled church members received a private audience with one of the church&#8217;s top officials, Marlin Jensen, who serves as the LDS&#8217;s historian. The church members tearfully told Jensen their stories&#8212;of being shunned by their families, and the homophobia generated by the Prop. 8 campaign. &#8220;We explained that [the church had] pitted father against son, mother against daughter, exactly the opposite of what we stand for,&#8221; says Mayne, who attended the meeting.</p> \n\n<p>After listening to them talk, Jensen did something almost unheard of in a church whose strict authoritarian hierarchy is unaccustomed to being challenged from below: He apologized &#8220;for the pain that Prop. 8 caused [us],&#8221; Mayne recalls, choking up at the memory. It was, he says, a &#8220;very meaningful event.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The apology from a high church official turned out to be just the beginning of a cultural shift toward greater acceptance of gays and lesbians within LDS ranks. In 2011, Mayne was called to serve as an official of his local San Francisco ward, as an openly gay man. It was a historic appointment in an institution with a long history of excommunicating openly gay members, which it referred to as people who were &#8220;afflicted&#8221; with same-sex attraction.</p> \n\n<p>Since then, the church has opened its doors to LGBT members in many places, Mayne says: &#8220;Everybody is welcome here. Nobody is under that threat of being excommunicated.&#8221; In 2012, the church even created a website, <a href=\"http://www.mormonsandgays.org\" type=\"external\">Mormonsandgays.org</a>, to convey its desire for more-humane treatment of LGBT members. Also last year, about 300 straight Mormons marched in the Salt Lake City pride parade, a significant and emotional first. Mayne says the new website, like the church, still has a long way to go, but he and other gay Mormons see it as a step in the right direction.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Perhaps most significantly, the church has made a concerted effort to bring LGBT kids back into the fold. Mayne points out that gay Mormon kids have significantly higher suicide rates than gay non-Mormon ones&#8212;a problem that has been attributed to the church&#8217;s longtime policy of forcing parents of gay kids to choose between their church and their children. It also has long been common practice for Mormon parents to kick LGBT adolescents out of their homes because of their sexual orientation. (When Matt Lawrence, the church pollster&#8217;s son, broke with his family over Prop. 8, he told stories about his family&#8217;s efforts to &#8220;straighten me out&#8221; by sending him to live with homophobic cousins in Utah.) Utah foster parents, too, generally <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">won&#8217;t take in LGBT children</a>. That&#8217;s one reason why heavily Mormon Utah has so many homeless LGBT kids on the streets. But even that is starting to change.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>The church has worked with the Family Acceptance Project at San Francisco State University to craft an educational booklet aimed specifically at helping Mormons parent their gay kids, to keep them safe at home and to prevent suicide. It&#8217;s a remarkably humane document instructing church members on how to embrace their gay kids even when they&#8217;re uncomfortable with their purple hair and transgendered friends. The pamphlet is now being used in lots of Mormon wards. Meanwhile, in Salt Lake City, where the church is headquartered, the church has teamed up with the&amp;#160;LGBT&amp;#160;community to open a shelter for young homeless people there, about 40 percent of whom are known to be&amp;#160;LGBT.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The LGBT community had reached out to the church several times before Prop. 8 and we&#8217;ve never been able to connect,&#8221; says Jim Dabakis, head of the Utah Democratic Party and cofounder of the Utah Pride Center in Salt Lake, who has been involved in these conversations. But after the Prop. 8 backlash, the Utah LGBT community, along with national leaders, commenced a series of meetings with church hierarchy. The first meetings were &#8220;a bit uncomfortable,&#8221;&amp;#160;Dabakis recalls. But then, &#8220;as we began to meet, and we began to introduce our families, it became much less an issue about legal points, what is the definition of a family, what kind of overarching legal principals are involved, and much more about Christian values and how people should be treated. Minds changed on both sides.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Not everything has changed, of course. The church still filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of Prop. 8, although it doesn&#8217;t read like the same sort of full-throated anti-gay sentiment that drove the initiative. The church lawyers who drafted the document seem to have bent over backward to express how much they like gays, and to frame the issue in terms of states&#8217; rights, as opposed to morality.</p> \n\n<p>Mormon church doctrine still defines homosexuality as a sin. The gay Mormon website clarifies that while having a same-sex attraction is not a sin, acting on it is. Mayne was only able to take on his leadership role in the church after he broke up with his longtime partner and was single again. And noncelibate LGBT members are still excluded from &#8220;temple recommends&#8221;&#8212;access to the church&#8217;s most sacred spaces and ceremonies.</p> \n\n<p>Dabakis says that there are still many points of disagreement. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think the church has given one iota on gay marriage&#8212;maybe they never will&#8212;and neither have we. On the other hand, we have found a lot of commonalities that we can work on,&#8221; he says, pointing towards the joint efforts to help homeless kids.</p> \n\n<p>The LGBT community&#8217;s best evidence of change within the church is that last year, in the only four states ever to pass marriage equality laws, the church &#8220;did not provide one dime or one volunteer,&#8221; Dabakis says. He adds that in Maryland, when one local Mormon leader tried to organize to oppose a pro-marriage-equality initiative, the church shut her down.</p> \n\n<p>Regardless of how the Supreme Court rules in the Prop. 8 case, the church responsible for its passage has been permanently changed for the better. In Mayne&#8217;s view, this all means that Prop. 8, with all its ugliness, happened for a reason: &#8220;I believe in our attempt to nail shut the Pandora&#8217;s box of gay marriage, we essentially blew the lid off of it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Mormon Church Abandons Its Crusade Against Gay Marriage", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2013/04/prop-8-mormons-gay-marriage-shift/", "published_at": "2013-04-12", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>My name is JACK ELY and I&#8217;m the one whose voice is heard daily on The Kingsmen&#8217;s 1963 recording of Louie Louie, (may it rest in peace) so you know I have some music business experience.</p> \n\n<p>First I&#8217;d like to express an opinion that probably will not be very popular but which oozes with truth. In the early &#8217;60&#8217;s when I was recording, records were thought of as a tool to help promote live performances. The live performances were the main revenue stream and the records were just promotional tools to get people to come see the shows. Somewhere this mode of thinking got turned upside down. Consequently in years hence, record companies, producers, et. all, have made recordings, hoping to profit from the sale of those recordings alone, regardless of whether or not the artist could ever pull it off live. This did some things to the music business that weren&#8217;t very healthy. First it made available to the general public, music of artists who may or may not be good live performers; almost anyone can make a good recording with enough cut-ins and loops. And&#8230; it made music by groups of players who never ever intended to perform that music live, and who may or may not have ever been able to get along with each other long enough to really sustain any kind of a road show.</p> \n\n<p>Music is meant to be played for the enjoyment of the audiences. For instance, if I go into the studio with an acoustic guitar and simultaneously play and sing on a recording, people would come to see me perform in that same mode; I.e. playing guitar and singing as a solo act. I don&#8217;t think they would come to see me expecting a full band. Conversely, if I advertised a &#8216;Night with Louie Louie&#8221; people would come expecting to see a rock band that they could dance to, and would be quite disappointed if I showed up with just my acoustic guitar.</p> \n\n<p>The suggestions that recordings are produced today just to sell recorded music is all backwards and the sooner the record companies and producers and artists figure this out the sooner they will all quit sniveling over the fact that the entire world is freely sharing their music digitally and isn&#8217;t willing to stop; and in fact will do anything to circumvent their efforts to get paid for the recordings alone.</p> \n\n<p>The days of producers and musicians putting bands together just to get a recording deal so they can get paid by the record company for a product that usually never even gets released; those days are over. It&#8217;s time record companies went back to their roots and became what they started out to be; entities who record working acts in order to</p> \n\n<p>1) capture the performance for posterity, and</p> \n\n<p>2) make a promotional tool to get audiences to the next show.</p> \n\n<p>The solution is to give the world all the free music it wants, but to give the recording entity, whether it be a record company or a producer, or whomever, a cut of every live performance. That will do at least two things and maybe more that I haven&#8217;t even thought about yet. First it will give everyone involved in the recordings a source of revenue (pay day) for all their hard work of producing and promoting the recordings. Second, it will weed out all the so-called &#8220;recording artists&#8221; who couldn&#8217;t, in a live venue, perform their way out of a paper bag. In a down economy the public craves live entertainment, so what better time to get back to basics. The timing couldn&#8217;t be better for a profitable turn around. So now is the time to get it going.</p> \n\n<p>I send you these thoughts in hopes that just maybe a new/old perspective on the subject of recorded music can be presented to the entire recording world and they can all start making a real profit.</p> \n\n<p>JACK ELY, the former lead singer of The Kingsmen, is a veteran horse trainer.

She dreamed about her Houston-area youth group holding fundraising events for&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.water.cc/\" type=\"external\">Living Water International</a>, an organization she had heard about at school.</p> \n\n<p>When she awoke, she described the dream to her mother, who encouraged her to tell Debi Foley, associate pastor to students at Sugar Land Baptist.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;She came to me with a folder filed with information about Living Water International,&#8221; Foley recalled.</p> \n\n<p>The faith-based nonprofit organization in nearby Stafford, Texas, exists &#8220;to demonstrate the love of God by helping communities acquire desperately needed clean water and experience &#8216;Living Water&#8217; &#8212; the gospel of Jesus Christ &#8212; which alone satisfies the deepest thirst,&#8221; according to its mission statement. Living Water&#8217;s board of directors includes Mark Hartman, pastor of&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://sugarcreek.net/\" type=\"external\">Sugar Creek Baptist Church</a>&amp;#160;in Sugar Land, and Chris Seay, pastor of&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.ecclesiahouston.org/\" type=\"external\">Ecclesia Church</a>&amp;#160;in Houston.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Living Water International not only builds wells across the globe to help bring clean drinking water, but they also do hygiene classes with the community and train individuals in each location in well-maintenance,&#8221; Foley said.</p> \n\n<p>The ministry grew out of a 1990 mission trip to Kenya involving about three-dozen volunteers from Sugar Creek Baptist Church. It began by teaching Kenyans in the Mombasa area how to drill a water well, and it grew into a ministry that has resulted in 12,797 completed water projects in 23 countries, mostly in Africa, South Asia and Latin America.</p> \n\n<p>Honeycutt presented a plan to Foley, complete with ideas about how to involve the church&#8217;s youth group in various events to raise money for the ministry and raise awareness about the need for clean water in developing nations.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I told her, &#8216;If you have the plan and the vision, I am in full support,&#8217;&#8221; Foley recalled.</p> \n\n<p>The student group washed cars and donated all the proceeds to Living Water International.</p> \n\n<p>Another initiative involved Project H2O, in which church members were challenged to drink nothing but water for two weeks and donate any money they would have spent on beverages to Living Water.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It has made our church aware of the number of people around the globe who don&#8217;t have access to something that we often take for granted,&#8221; Foley said.</p> \n\n<p>The youth group also organized an annual churchwide dessert auction. The students provide entertainment and church members bid on donated baked goods. Proceeds are designated for well-drilling projects.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The dessert auction raised $13,000 in one night early on, and we raised $22,000 in one night last year,&#8221; Foley recalled.</p> \n\n<p>In five years, the youth group has inspired Sugar Land Baptist Church to donate $94,817 to build and maintain 12 wells in Africa and India.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;What started as a dream has become a reality for 12 different communities, including a school in Uganda,&#8221; Foley said. &#8220;In those 12 locations, there is now access to clean drinking water, information about proper hygiene and the knowledge of the Living Water of Jesus Christ.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Sugar Land Baptist Pastor Phil Lineberger praised the students&#8217; commitment to alleviating human suffering.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It speaks volumes about their priorities and their sensitivity to the most pressing needs of our world.

I first met The Chucks, as I call them, a few years ago in a writers&#8217; group at Eagle Eye Bookstore here in Decatur. The group eventually got so large that the three of us peeled off to form a smaller circle, and for the better part of the next year we spent two hours every Monday afternoon reading aloud our works-in-progress and exchanging feedback and support. Chuck One worked in computers until he retired and is now penning a sci-fi thriller.&amp;#160; Chuck Two used to be an architect and is halfway through a memoir about the years he spent as a boy in the company of Robert Frost.</p> \n\n<p>Both are brilliant, hilarious and happily agnostic. &#8220;So this is where the abracadabra happens!&#8221; Chuck One said with a mixture of sarcasm and awe the first time I showed him our sanctuary. Quickly dubbing me their authority on all things religious, each week they dropped some new question at my feet, like a cat presents a prize mouse on the doorstep after a night&#8217;s hunt. No question was too lofty or absurd: Why did God allow the Crusades? Do TV preachers all use the same hair stylist? What does God do if Hitler converts just as the cyanide is kicking in?</p> \n\n<p>Whenever the three of us met, in addition to our writing we also caught each other up on our families, our histories and whatever else was on our minds. We opened up to each other. We took risks with each other. In short, we became friends.</p> \n\n<p>As it happened, during the entire time that The Chucks and I were meeting, our church was going through the kind of turmoil, anxiety and conflict that comes whenever a congregation grapples with a particularly difficult challenge. Our own conundrum had largely to do with the economic realities facing nearly every faith community in 21st century America. It was perhaps the hardest, most painful time I&#8217;d known in twenty-five years of ministry.</p> \n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t hard for The Chucks to see that I was exhausted, stressed and semi-depressed. One Monday as we were getting settled, they put their manuscripts aside and said, &#8220;Look, kiddo, you&#8217;ve got to tell us what&#8217;s going on. You&#8217;re a wreck. What gives?&#8221;&amp;#160;I was caught off guard. I had never mentioned the situation to them. But they persisted, so for the next few minutes I did my best to describe it:</p> \n\n<p>Well, see, we&#8217;re financially out of balance and, well . . . our deacons and personnel committee have called a congregational meeting and, um . . . our bylaws require that we, um, well . . . there&#8217;ll be a vote and, uh . . . we&#8217;re bringing in a professional parliamentarian and, well . . . it&#8217;s all really painful for our staff and congregation, and people are upset and some are leaving and, well . . .</p> \n\n<p>I stopped. I could see from their earnest faces that they were totally there for me. They were leaning forward and nodding supportively like friends do. I looked at them looking at me.&amp;#160;And then I understood.</p> \n\n<p>This issue&#8212;over which our congregation had prayed, wept, agonized, cited Scripture, fretted, battled, held dozens of meetings and devoted hundreds of committee hours&#8212;was such an exclusively internal concern, it had about as much chance of encouraging my two agnostic friends toward God as a monster truck rally or the latest episode of Spongebob.</p> \n\n<p>Eighteen months later I still find myself thinking about that afternoon. If your church happens to be on a steep path like the one we&#8217;ve been walking, I want to offer three encouragements:</p> \n\n<p>1.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; The fact that an internal problem doesn&#8217;t translate easily to unchurched lives does not mean it&#8217;s unimportant.&amp;#160; If the wheels are coming off the wagon, you&#8217;ve got to pull off the road and deal with it. In our own congregation the issue affected the livelihoods of beloved staff, not to mention the emotional and spiritual health of the congregation&#8212;you bet it was important.

It&#8217;s not about right-sizing the budget, or protecting staff, or releasing staff, or keeping big givers happy, or preserving our heritage. Ultimately, it&#8217;s about people who are at this moment at the gym, the corner pub, the city jail, the corporate dining room, the community garden, the immigration office, the Rotary Club or anywhere but these churches of ours.</p> \n\n<p>3.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; Spend yourself for something big.&amp;#160; When we find ourselves investing as much prayer and passion and intellect and committee energy and congregational wattage trying to befriend our estranged-from-God neighbors as we devote to all of our internal affairs&#8212;we will have taken a really promising step.</p> \n\n<p>In the end, it&#8217;s about The Chucks.</p>", "title": "A tale of two Chucks", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://baptistnews.com/article/a-tale-of-two-chucks/", "published_at": "", "bias": 3}, {"text": "<p>.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>New Mexico&#8217;s Spaceport America will be featured in an upcoming reality show.</p> \n\n<p>NBC has announced an exclusive deal with Richard Branson&#8217;s Virgin Galactic and One Three Media to create a series called &#8220;Space Race.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The show will feature an elimination competition by real people vying for a free spot on one of Virgin Galactic&#8217;s commercial space flights.</p> \n\n<p>The company is hoping to launch the flights from New Mexico&#8217;s futuristic spaceport in southern New Mexico next year at a cost of $200,000 a head.</p> \n\n<p>Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant at the spaceport, and much of its space will only be accessible by its high-paying customers.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>But according to a news release announcing the reality show, &#8220;Space Race&#8221; will have unprecedented access to Virgin Galactic&#8217;s home in the state-of-the-art spaceport.</p> \n\n<p>The company&#8217;s rocket plane SpaceShipTwo last month went Mach 1.43 in a test flight in the skies above the Mojave Desert, a key milestone in Virgin Galactic&#8217;s effort to be the world&#8217;s first commercial space liner.

But before you make that first call, sit down and do some hard thinking.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Establish what you feel you could afford based on your budget,&#8221; says Huss. &#8220;Once you make that phone call and the loan officer tells you what you qualify for, the temptation to go higher is real.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Before diving into the housing market, ask yourself these five questions.</p> \n\n<p>HOW MUCH CAN I AFFORD?</p> \n\n<p>It may be hard to figure out what you can truly afford. &#8220;The very best ratio to have is one-fourth of your income going toward house payments,&#8221; says Jessica Cecere, formerly president of Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast in Florida.</p> \n\n<p>Cecere says she means net income, or 25 percent of what you earn after taxes &#8212; lenders calculate using gross income. &#8220;Anywhere between 25 (percent) and 32 (percent) is safe. Anything over 35 (percent) is the danger zone,&#8221; she says.</p> \n\n<p>A higher ratio puts you at risk if anything changes, like an increase in insurance costs. &#8220;One hurricane in Florida and insurance charges can double,&#8221; she says.</p> \n\n<p>Then there is the prospect of job loss. &#8220;With 25 percent, even with the loss of one income, you can still keep your home,&#8221; Cecere says.</p> \n\n<p>Huss says you should know your financial situation before you approach a lender and borrow accordingly. A 30-year fixed mortgage is preferable. Chart out how high your payments would be at different rates by using Bankrate.com&#8217;s mortgage calculator.</p> \n\n<p>Once you know what you can afford to pay on the mortgage, you can figure out your housing price range, Huss says.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>WHAT ARE MY COSTS OUTSIDE THE LOAN?</p> \n\n<p>First-timers tend to miscalculate the total tab for sealing the purchase and the cost of maintaining a home.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Have a thorough conversation about down payment costs and closing costs,&#8221; Huss says. You need to know the total out-of-pocket costs.</p> \n\n<p>Next, make sure you consider all the monthly charges. Online calculators on realty sites don&#8217;t always include taxes, homeowners association dues, utilities, and home and mortgage insurance.</p> \n\n<p>They certainly don&#8217;t allow for flooring and window treatments, which your landlord covered previously.</p> \n\n<p>If you&#8217;re buying a fixer-upper, get several contractor bids so you know what lies ahead.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;You always have to be prepared, new or old, to make any repairs,&#8221; Cecere says. If your mortgage is at 25 percent of income, repairs can bring your cost to 30 percent.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We always say you should have three months of basic living expenses in a very liquid place, and part of that is your house emergency fund,&#8221; Cecere says.</p> \n\n<p>Finally, double-check utilities and tax costs to avoid nasty surprises.</p> \n\n<p>WHAT DO I NEED IN A NEIGHBORHOOD?</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I always sit down and say, &#8216;Give me your wish list,'&#8221; says Chris Pagano, a Realtor with Coldwell Banker in Chicago. &#8220;What are the must-haves?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Pagano says the way you live is key. He asks buyers, &#8220;What do you do when you come home?&#8221; That can help buyers determine whether proximity to a gym, park or good restaurants matters.</p> \n\n<p>He urges buyers to consider how they will get from home to other places. Walking three blocks to a bus stop when it&#8217;s 10 degrees can be bone-chilling. If you drive, try it before you buy.</p> \n\n<p>Check out potential neighborhoods at different times of day, Realtors emphasize.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Sure, look at the MLS, see the reports, but walk the neighborhood,&#8221; says Michael Friedman, a Realtor with The Grubb Co. in the Oakland-Berkeley-Piedmont area in California.</p> \n\n<p>WILL THIS HOUSE FIT MY LONG-TERM GOALS?</p> \n\n<p>While you have to make a purchasing decision based on your current financial situation, you should imagine your future personal and work life.</p> \n\n<p>Friedman suggests buyers ask themselves, &#8220;Are we going to grow our family?&#8221; and &#8220;How many bedrooms do we need?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>If you think an elderly parent may move in or you&#8217;ll need a home office, include that in your decision. Don&#8217;t forget about schools. Sometimes, paying more for a house can be cheaper in the long run. A pricier home in a better school district can be cheaper than a lower-priced home plus private school for 13 years.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;This home will let us go for public school and not pay $50,000 for private school,&#8221; may be the thinking, Friedman says.</p> \n\n<p>AM I TRULY PREPARED TO BE A HOMEOWNER?</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Whatever your money attitude is, when you have a home, a lot of your money will go (to it),&#8221; says Cecere. &#8220;A lot of your time will be spent dealing with your home.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Make sure you understand what&#8217;s involved. You should ask yourself before buying if you have good spending habits. If possible, take a homebuyer class in person or online.</p> \n\n<p>If you&#8217;re ready and buy responsibly, experts say homebuying can still be a wise financial move.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Owning a house is still better than renting,&#8221; Huss says. &#8220;You should absolutely be able to find a great house for what you can afford.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p> \n\n<p>ABOUT THE WRITER</p> \n\n<p>Aviya Kushner writes for Bankrate.com.

Far too many politicians in California are so heavily influenced by big money that constituents seem to be nothing more than an afterthought and a group to pander to for political advertisements.</p> \n\n<p>For many years politicians have sought political contributions from corporations and unions, then voted the way those special interests ordered.</p> \n\n<p>And, unfortunately, too many politically ambitious Republicans have gone along&amp;#160;with the big-government party plan instead of thwarting the political dominance from unions and big corporations.</p> \n\n<p>The only way to begin real reform in the Golden State is to neuter the money influences. <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_32,_the_%22Paycheck_Protection%22_Initiative_(2012)\" type=\"external\">Proposition 32</a>, the &#8220;Paycheck Protection&#8221; ballot initiative, could begin the reform process.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_32,_the_%22Paycheck_Protection%22_Initiative_(2012)\" type=\"external\">Prop. 32</a> would end the questionable practice of the automatic deduction of funds from employee paychecks for political purposes; would end union and corporate contributions to political candidates; and would end government contractor contributions to elected officials.&amp;#160;The prohibition applies to labor unions and corporations, as well as to government contractors.</p> \n\n<p>In only the last 10 years, the California Teachers Association, the Service Employees International Union, and the California State Employee Association, have spent hundreds of millions of dollars on lobbying and political contributions, according to the <a href=\"http://www.fppc.ca.gov/reports/Report31110.pdf\" type=\"external\">Fair Political Practices Commission</a>.

There were three additional bands of American Indians that spent a combined $77 million.</p> \n\n<p>The California Realtors Association spent $33.3 million. Even the trial lawyers association spent $21.3 million between 2000 and 2010.</p> \n\n<p>The shocking spending increase in local political races should prove that the big political spenders think that local races matter even more than local voters do.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\" /></p> \n\n<p>In 2010, a friend of mine ran for the Sacramento City Unified School District Board of Directors.

The goal is to help people move from public assistance into jobs that provide health insurance. &#8220;We see people moving off of Medicaid as a good outcome,&#8221; she said.</p> \n\n<p>But advocates said work requirements will become one more hoop for low-income people to jump through, and many could be denied needed coverage because of technicalities and challenging new paperwork. Lawsuits are expected as individual states roll out work requirements.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;All of this on paper may sound reasonable, but if you think about the people who are affected, you can see people will fall through the cracks,&#8221; said Judy Solomon of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which advocates for the poor.</p> \n\n<p>Created in 1965 for families on welfare and low-income seniors, Medicaid now covers more than 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. The federal-state collaboration has become the nation&#8217;s largest health insurance program.</p> \n\n<p>Beneficiaries range from pregnant women and newborns to elderly nursing home residents. Medicaid was expanded under former President Barack Obama, with an option allowing states to cover millions more low-income adults. Many of them have jobs that don&#8217;t provide health insurance.</p> \n\n<p>People are not legally required to hold a job to be on Medicaid, but states traditionally can seek federal waivers to test new ideas for the program.</p> \n\n<p>Verma stressed that the administration is providing an option for states to require work, not making it mandatory across the country. Her agency spelled out safeguards that states should put in place to get federal approval for their waivers.</p> \n\n<p>States can also require alternatives to work, including volunteering, caregiving, education, job training and even treatment for a substance abuse problem.</p> \n\n<p>The administration said 10 states have applied for waivers involving work requirements or community involvement. They are: Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin. Advocates for low-income people say they expect Kentucky&#8217;s waiver to be approved shortly.</p> \n\n<p>In Kentucky, which expanded Medicaid, Republican state Sen. Damon Thayer said work requirements could lessen the program&#8217;s impact on the state budget. They also hearken back to the program&#8217;s original intent, he added, &#8220;as temporary assistance to try to help people get back on their feet, not a permanent subsidy for someone&#8217;s lifestyle, if they&#8217;re capable of working.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But congressional Democrats said the Trump administration is moving in the wrong direction. &#8220;Health care is a right that shouldn&#8217;t be contingent on the ideological agendas of politicians,&#8221; said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate committee that oversees Medicaid.</p> \n\n<p>The debate about work requirements doesn&#8217;t break neatly along liberal-conservative lines.</p> \n\n<p>A poll last year from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found that 70 percent of the public supported allowing states to require Medicaid recipients to work, even as most Americans opposed deep Medicaid cuts sought by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration.</p> \n\n<p>Another Kaiser study found that most working-age adults on Medicaid are already employed. Nearly 60 percent work either full time or part time, mainly for employers that don&#8217;t offer health insurance.</p> \n\n<p>Most who are not working report reasons such as illness, caring for a family member or going to school. Some Medicaid recipients say the coverage has enabled them to get healthy enough to return to work.</p> \n\n<p>Thursday&#8217;s administration guidance spells out safeguards that states should consider in seeking work requirements. These include:</p> \n\n<p>&#8212;Exempting pregnant women, disabled people and the elderly.</p> \n\n<p>&#8212;Taking into account hardships for people in areas with high unemployment, or for people caring for children or elderly relatives.</p> \n\n<p>&#8212;Allowing people under treatment for substance abuse to have their care counted as &#8220;community engagement&#8221; for purposes of meeting a requirement.</p> \n\n<p>The administration said states must fully comply with federal disability and civil rights laws to accommodate disabled people and prevent those who are medically frail from being denied coverage. States should try to align their Medicaid work requirements with similar conditions in other programs, such as food stamps and cash assistance.</p> \n\n<p>The National Association of Medicaid Directors, a nonpartisan group representing state officials, said in a statement there&#8217;s no consensus on whether work requirements are the right approach.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;This is a very complex issue that will require thoughtful and nuanced approaches,&#8221; said the group.</p> \n\n<p>Trump&#8217;s new direction can be reversed by a future administration. Although waivers can have lasting impact they don&#8217;t amount to a permanent change in the program. They&#8217;re considered &#8220;demonstration programs&#8221; to test ideas. The administration says the impact will be closely evaluated.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We know that Republicans tend to think of Medicaid more as a welfare program, while Democrats tend to think of it as more of a health insurance program,&#8221; said Diane Rowland, the Kaiser foundation&#8217;s leading expert on the program. &#8220;It will be interesting to see how states are going to make this work for people.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Associated Press writer Bruce Schreiner in Louisville, Ky., contributed to this report.</p> \n\n<p>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8212; Rewriting the rules on health care for the poor, the Trump administration said Thursday it will allow states to require &#8220;able-bodied&#8221; Medicaid recipients to work, a hotly debated first in the program&#8217;s half-century history.</p> \n\n<p>Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said requiring work or community involvement can make a positive difference in people&#8217;s lives and in their health. The goal is to help people move from public assistance into jobs that provide health insurance. &#8220;We see people moving off of Medicaid as a good outcome,&#8221; she said.</p> \n\n<p>But advocates said work requirements will become one more hoop for low-income people to jump through, and many could be denied needed coverage because of technicalities and challenging new paperwork. Lawsuits are expected as individual states roll out work requirements.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;All of this on paper may sound reasonable, but if you think about the people who are affected, you can see people will fall through the cracks,&#8221; said Judy Solomon of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which advocates for the poor.</p> \n\n<p>Created in 1965 for families on welfare and low-income seniors, Medicaid now covers more than 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. The federal-state collaboration has become the nation&#8217;s largest health insurance program.</p> \n\n<p>Beneficiaries range from pregnant women and newborns to elderly nursing home residents. Medicaid was expanded under former President Barack Obama, with an option allowing states to cover millions more low-income adults. Many of them have jobs that don&#8217;t provide health insurance.</p> \n\n<p>People are not legally required to hold a job to be on Medicaid, but states traditionally can seek federal waivers to test new ideas for the program.</p> \n\n<p>Verma stressed that the administration is providing an option for states to require work, not making it mandatory across the country. Her agency spelled out safeguards that states should put in place to get federal approval for their waivers.</p> \n\n<p>States can also require alternatives to work, including volunteering, caregiving, education, job training and even treatment for a substance abuse problem.</p> \n\n<p>The administration said 10 states have applied for waivers involving work requirements or community involvement. They are: Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin. Advocates for low-income people say they expect Kentucky&#8217;s waiver to be approved shortly.</p> \n\n<p>In Kentucky, which expanded Medicaid, Republican state Sen. Damon Thayer said work requirements could lessen the program&#8217;s impact on the state budget. They also hearken back to the program&#8217;s original intent, he added, &#8220;as temporary assistance to try to help people get back on their feet, not a permanent subsidy for someone&#8217;s lifestyle, if they&#8217;re capable of working.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But congressional Democrats said the Trump administration is moving in the wrong direction. &#8220;Health care is a right that shouldn&#8217;t be contingent on the ideological agendas of politicians,&#8221; said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate committee that oversees Medicaid.</p> \n\n<p>The debate about work requirements doesn&#8217;t break neatly along liberal-conservative lines.</p> \n\n<p>A poll last year from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found that 70 percent of the public supported allowing states to require Medicaid recipients to work, even as most Americans opposed deep Medicaid cuts sought by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration.</p> \n\n<p>Another Kaiser study found that most working-age adults on Medicaid are already employed. Nearly 60 percent work either full time or part time, mainly for employers that don&#8217;t offer health insurance.</p> \n\n<p>Most who are not working report reasons such as illness, caring for a family member or going to school. Some Medicaid recipients say the coverage has enabled them to get healthy enough to return to work.</p> \n\n<p>Thursday&#8217;s administration guidance spells out safeguards that states should consider in seeking work requirements. These include:</p> \n\n<p>&#8212;Exempting pregnant women, disabled people and the elderly.</p> \n\n<p>&#8212;Taking into account hardships for people in areas with high unemployment, or for people caring for children or elderly relatives.</p> \n\n<p>&#8212;Allowing people under treatment for substance abuse to have their care counted as &#8220;community engagement&#8221; for purposes of meeting a requirement.</p> \n\n<p>The administration said states must fully comply with federal disability and civil rights laws to accommodate disabled people and prevent those who are medically frail from being denied coverage. States should try to align their Medicaid work requirements with similar conditions in other programs, such as food stamps and cash assistance.</p> \n\n<p>The National Association of Medicaid Directors, a nonpartisan group representing state officials, said in a statement there&#8217;s no consensus on whether work requirements are the right approach.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;This is a very complex issue that will require thoughtful and nuanced approaches,&#8221; said the group.</p> \n\n<p>Trump&#8217;s new direction can be reversed by a future administration. Although waivers can have lasting impact they don&#8217;t amount to a permanent change in the program. They&#8217;re considered &#8220;demonstration programs&#8221; to test ideas. The administration says the impact will be closely evaluated.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We know that Republicans tend to think of Medicaid more as a welfare program, while Democrats tend to think of it as more of a health insurance program,&#8221; said Diane Rowland, the Kaiser foundation&#8217;s leading expert on the program. &#8220;It will be interesting to see how states are going to make this work for people.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Associated Press writer Bruce Schreiner in Louisville, Ky., contributed to this report.</p>", "title": "Medicaid recipients to get work requirements", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://apnews.com/2b5ad9b743ba4dd18b70d7e20d8b92d8", "published_at": "2018-01-12", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>When I picked up a ringing phone Monday morning, the next thing I knew a producer was inviting me to appear on Glenn Beck&#8217;s TV show.</p> \n\n<p>Beck has become a national phenom with his nightly hour of polemics on CNN Headline News &#8212; urging war on Iran, denouncing &#8220;political correctness&#8221; at home, trashing immigrants who don&#8217;t speak English, mocking environmentalists as repressive zealots, and generally trying to denigrate progressive outlooks.</p> \n\n<p>Our segment, the producer said, would focus on a recent NBC news report praising the virtues of energy-efficient LED light bulbs without acknowledging that the network&#8217;s parent company, General Electric, sells them. I figured it was a safe bet that Beck&#8217;s enthusiasm for full disclosure from media would be selective.</p> \n\n<p>A few hours later, I was staring into a camera lens at the CNN bureau in San Francisco while Beck launched into his opening. What had occurred on the &#8220;NBC Nightly News,&#8221; he explained, &#8220;was at best a major breach of journalistic integrity.&#8221; And he pointed out: &#8220;The problem isn&#8217;t what NBC is promoting. It&#8217;s what they&#8217;re not disclosing.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>A minute later, Beck asked his first question: &#8220;Norman, you agree with me that they should have disclosed this?&#8221; The unedited transcript tells what happened next.</p> \n\n<p>* * *</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;It&#8217;s a big problem when there&#8217;s not disclosure. I&#8217;m glad you opened this up. And I wouldn&#8217;t want any viewers of this program to be left with the impression that somehow General Electric is an environmentally conscious company.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;On the contrary, they have a 30-year history of refusing and actually fighting against efforts to make them clean up the Hudson River, which GE fouled with terrible quantities of horrific PCBs, other rivers as well. People told they can&#8217;t fish in the Hudson River. General Electric still lobbying to not have to clean up.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;General Electric, even today &#8212; and this report is very timely &#8212; General Electric is lobbying to get Congress to pass $18 billion in taxpayer-backed loan guarantees for a huge GE product which is General Electric components for nuclear power plants. So we should not be fooled in any way by efforts to greenwash General Electric or any other company.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;You know what&#8217;s amazing to me? GE has a bigger budget for &#8212; special interest budget than all of the oil companies combined, and yet nobody says anything. Let me reverse this.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Norman, do you think if I got on as somebody who says I don&#8217;t know what we can do about global warming, I&#8217;m not sure man causes it, and I certainly don&#8217;t want to have laws and regulations on this, if I got on and said that but I was being &#8212; my corporate &#8212; my corporate parent was Exxon Mobil, do you think I&#8217;d get away with that for a second without that being on the front page of the New York Times?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;Well, other networks, including General Electric&#8217;s NBC, have been very slow on global warming. And in fact, General Electric has major interest in components and products used by the oil and gas industry.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I think if you look across the board, all the major networks, even so-called public broadcasting, which has Chevron underwriting its &#8216;Washington Week&#8217; program every Friday, there is a problem, as you say. I think your words are very apt, &#8216;promoting&#8217; but &#8216;not disclosing.&#8217;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;But let&#8217;s be clear about this, Glenn. I have a list here, for instance, that I jotted down.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;ABC, owned by Disney. ABC doesn&#8217;t disclose in their relevant news reports about Disney&#8217;s stake in sweatshops.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Fox News &#8212; and now as of the last couple of days now, Wall Street Journal owned by the same entity, Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News Corp &#8212; they don&#8217;t disclose that the ownership is entangled with the Chinese government to the detriment of human rights but to the advancement of the profit margin of the parent company.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;See &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;We would be remiss, Glenn, if we left out CNN, because CNN has a huge multi, multibillion-dollar stake in Internet deregulation and the failure of the Congress to safeguard so far what would be called net neutrality. So every time CNN does a news report on the Internet, on efforts to regulate or deregulate or create a two- or three-tier system of the Internet, CNN News should disclose that Time Warner, the parent company, stands to gain or lose billions of dollars in those terms.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;And one more thing.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;Real quick.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;A major &#8212; a major advertiser for CNN is the largest military contractor in the United States, Lockheed Martin. So when you and others &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;I got news for you, Norman. Norman &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;&#8211; promote war &#8212; when you and others promote war on this network &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;Norman &#8212; Norman &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;&#8211; we have Lockheed Martin paying millions of dollars undisclosed. So I would quote you &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;Norman &#8212; Norman &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;Promoting but not disclosing is a bad way to go.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;Norman, let me just tell you this. First of all, Lockheed Martin is not a &#8212; not a corporate overlord of this program.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;It&#8217;s a major advertiser on CNN.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;That&#8217;s fine. That&#8217;s fine. Advertisers are different. But let &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;Well, it is fine, but it should be disclosed.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;Norman, let me just tell you something. If you think that it&#8217;s warmonger central downstairs at CNN, you&#8217;re out of your mind. But that&#8217;s a different story.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;Well, upstairs, when I watch Glenn Beck, in terms of attacking Iran, it certainly is. It&#8217;s lucrative for the oil companies, as well as for the major advertiser on CNN, Lockheed Martin.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;But we&#8217;re not talking about advertisers. We are talking about &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t want to talk about it. So let&#8217;s talk about the Internet stake.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;No, no, no. Norman &#8211;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about the Internet stake that the owners of CNN have. Huge profits to be made or lost by the parent company of CNN depending on what happens in Washington in terms of Internet regulation.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;Norman, let me tell you something.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>SOLOMON: &#8220;That should be acknowledged, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>BECK: &#8220;Absolutely. And if it was on this program, it would be acknowledged.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I thank you very much for your time.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;That just goes to show you, you&#8217;ve got to beware of everybody who you&#8217;re getting your news from. Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if once in a while somebody came on and said, you know, I don&#8217;t really have an agenda except the truth? It&#8217;s my truth. If you don&#8217;t like it, you should go someplace else.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>* * *</p> \n\n<p>During the back-and-forth, I&#8217;d understated the present-day role of Chevron as a funder of key news programming on PBS. Actually the Chevron Corporation, which signed on as an underwriter of &#8220;Washington Week&#8221; last year, no longer helps pay the piper there &#8212; but the massive energy firm does currently funnel big bucks to the most influential show on PBS, the nightly &#8220;NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The corporate funders of the &#8220;NewsHour&#8221; now include not only Chevron but also AT&amp;amp;T and Pacific Life. There must be dozens of journalistic reports on the program every week &#8212; whether relevant to the business worlds of energy, communications or insurance &#8212; that warrant, and lack, real-time disclosures while the news accounts are on the air. Meanwhile, over at &#8220;Washington Week,&#8221; the corporate cash now flows in from the huge military contractor Boeing and the National Mining Association.</p> \n\n<p>And that&#8217;s just &#8220;public broadcasting.&#8221; On avowedly commercial networks, awash in corporate ownership interests and advertising revenues, a thorough policy of disclosure in the course of news coverage would require that most of the airtime be devoted to shedding light on the media outlet conflicts-of-interest of the reporting in progress.</p> \n\n<p>And what about Glenn Beck? The guy is another in a long line of demagogues riding a bull market for pseudo-populism.

Although the amount of money that couples receive in Social Security income will vary depending on work history, income, and when couples begin receiving payments, the average couple is receiving $2,212 per month this year, according to the Social Security Administration.</p> \n\n<p>Are you likely to get this much money, too? Read on to learn how Social Security calculates its payment, and what you should do to maximize your benefit.</p> \n\n<p>First, a quick bit of backgroundMany Americans approach retirement thinking that Social Security is a savings account that's similar to a retirement account, such as an IRA or a 401(k) plan. It isn't. Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system, and that means that the 12.4% payroll tax you pay today covers the cost of current Social Security recipient's benefits, not your future benefit.</p> \n\n<p>While Social Security accounts for 90% or more of income for nearly a quarter of current married retirees, the system was never meant to provide the lion's share of a retiree's income. Instead, Social Security is supposed to act as a safety net. As such, it replaces about 40% of the average recipient's pre-retirement income.</p> \n\n<p>SOURCE: PIXABAY.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>How's it calculatedNow that we've covered those points, let's dig into the calculation Social Security uses to determine your benefit.</p> \n\n<p>First, Social Security calculates your benefit using a complex formula that converts income earned during your highest 35 working years into today's dollars. Then, those adjusted figures are added together and divided by 420 -- the number of months in 35 years -- to get an average monthly earnings number. That average monthly earnings number is then broken into chunks, and multipliers are used to calculate your monthly benefit at full retirement age, or the age at which you can claim and receive 100% of your benefit (more on that in a bit).</p> \n\n<p>For example, a person who was born in or after 1954 would multiply the first $856 in indexed monthly earnings by 90%, any amount between $856 and $5,157 by 32%, and any amount above $5,157 by 15%. Once those calculations are done, the resulting numbers are added together and rounded down to the nearest dollar. That sum is a person's estimated monthly retirement benefit at full retirement age.</p> \n\n<p>This formula is used to calculate benefits for the primary recipient, but it's also the number that is used to calculate a spouse's benefit, too. Generally, if a spouse is retiring at full retirement age, the spouse can receive half of the amount that the primary recipient would receive at their full retirement age. If the spouse claims early, then the amount they receive will be reduced.</p> \n\n<p>For example, if a spouse born in 1960 claims benefits two years before their full-retirement age, they'd receive 41.67% of the primary recipient's benefit.It may also be helpful to know that, if a spouse's own work record results in a higher Social Security payment than the spousal benefit, then the spouse would receive that higher payment instead.</p> \n\n<p>Although these calculations can be complex, the Social Security Administration provides a <a href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/planners/benefitcalculators.html\" type=\"external\">handy calculator Opens a New Window.</a> that can allow married couples to better estimate their benefit when they retire, or individuals can log in to Social Security online and find out their specific benefit.</p> \n\n<p>SOURCE: SENIORLIVING.ORG.</p> \n\n<p>Maximizing your incomeIn the past, couples could use a file-and-suspend strategy to increase their overall Social Security income. This strategy involved the primary worker and the spouse claiming Social Security at full retirement age. Then the primary worker would suspend his or her payments so that they could benefit from delayed benefit credits that are awarded to people who hold off on receiving Social Security until they reach 70 years old.</p> \n\n<p>Unfortunately, this \"loophole\" closes at the end of March, but there are a couple of options that can still help couples boost their Social Security income.</p> \n\n<p>First, because Social Security uses the highest 35-years of income to calculate average monthly adjusted earnings, it may benefit couples to work a year or two longer. If the filer's work history includes more than 35 years, then every year worked at a higher income eliminates a low-income earning year, thereby boosting the monthly benefit.</p> \n\n<p>If that's an unpalatable option (and trust me, I understand), and you have other sources of retirement income, then it might be worth delaying Social Security until you reach age 70. Claiming at age 62, the earliest age possible, results in income that is less than you'd receive at your full retirement age (currently age 66); but if you were born after 1943, you'll get an 8% yearly increase to your benefit for every year that you delay receiving Social Security beyond your full retirement age, up to age 70. Unfortunately, delaying until 70 won't increase your spouse's benefit because the spousal benefit will always be based on your full retirement benefit instead.</p> \n\n<p>Nevertheless, combining your higher income from delaying with your spouse's benefit will still provide more income than if you both took Social Security sooner.</p> \n\n<p>The article <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/19/how-much-do-married-couples-get-in-social-security.aspx\" type=\"external\">How Much Do Married Couples Get in Social Security?

Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006</a>, greatly increasing regulatory control over state industries.</p> \n\n<p>Shortly after, &#8220;global warming&#8221; went out of favor, replaced by &#8220;climate change.&#8221;&amp;#160;Just two years later, in his <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/28/us/politics/28text-obama.html?pagewanted=all\" type=\"external\">acceptance speech</a>at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, candidate Barack Obama didn&#8217;t mention &#8220;global warming,&#8221; only &#8220;climate change.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>For example, in a debate over global warming on our site last week, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">one commentator wrote</a>, &#8220;It&#8217;s called climate change, John. You have record cold in some places and record heat in others.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But the phrase &#8220;climate change&#8221; is a logical fallacy called a tautology, also called circular reasoning.

It doesn&#8217;t hurt that some connected crony capitalists, such as Al Gore, <a href=\"http://www.examiner.com/article/al-gore-pushes-global-warming-for-personal-profit\" type=\"external\">have become even richer</a>by investing in global warming/climate change technology boosted by governments.</p> \n\n<p>The problem has cropped up that the global-warming hypothesis is hard to advance when temperatures have ceased increasing <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/22/science/la-sci-climate-change-uncertainty-20130923\" type=\"external\">the past 15 years</a>.

Presumably you don't want to forego having a happy retirement, so you'll need to find an approach that won't require you to work until you're 90 or live on cat food. Fortunately, it's not too late to get your act together and develop some sources of income.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Now is the time to pull out all the stops on saving money. Granted, you don't have tons of time for the magic of compounding to help that money grow, but you do have at least a decade or two -- that's enough time to allow some returns to build up, but only if you start saving right away. First, max out your retirement contributions for IRA and 401(k) accounts. Someone age 50 or older may contribute $6,500 per year to IRAs and $60,000 per year to 401(k)s. If you don't have access to a 401(k), then max out your IRA and stick the rest into a standard investment account. You won't get the immediate tax benefits, but at least you've got more capital building up to provide future income. https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/cola-increases-for-dollar-limitations-on-benefits-and-contributions</p> \n\n<p>Of course, now you're probably wondering how you could possibly save thousands of dollars when you're living paycheck to paycheck. The answer is to find more income -- and put every penny of the extra money into savings. Some options for increasing your income include asking your boss for a raise, working longer hours, taking a part-time job on the side, holding a garage sale or otherwise disposing of unwanted items for a profit, turning a hobby into a source of income, and so on. Whatever new source of income you find, tuck the money away in savings immediately so you're not tempted to spend it on something else.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Getty Images.</p> \n\n<p>If you planned to retire at age 65 or 67, consider putting it off a few years longer.

If your Social Security benefits are higher, you won't need as much income from those underfunded retirement accounts. And every year that you continue to put money into your retirement accounts instead of taking it out will help your long-term financial outlook immensely.</p> \n\n<p>If you're laboring under a burden of heavy debt, you should make getting rid of that debt a priority. Not only will debt be an extra expense during retirement, but the interest you pay on that debt will require additional income just to keep up with the payments. Pay off high interest rate debt such as credit cards as soon as possible; the interest you pay on credit card debt will be more than enough to cancel out any returns you're getting on your investments. Once you've offloaded the most dangerous debt, consider paying off less expensive debt such as mortgages, car payments, and any remaining student loans as well. Getting rid of those monthly payments will lower your income needs considerably and allow you to live comfortably in retirement on a much lower income.</p> \n\n<p>Obviously, a retirement won't be much of a retirement if you're working full time. However, if you have a part-time job working just a few hours a week, you can add to an income that's not quite enough to meet your needs. Rather than settling for flipping burgers at McDonald's, try to find a part-time job that you will actually enjoy. For example, if you love gardening, consider expanding your garden and selling seeds, plants, produce, and flowers at your local farmers market. The resulting income probably won't be enough to support you all by itself, but it could be enough to supplement the income from a small retirement account. It's not really work if you love doing it, right?</p> \n\n<p>If you own a house, it can potentially be an excellent source of retirement income. You can tap directly into the equity you have stored in your house through a home equity line of credit or, more drastically, a <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/retirement/general/2016/05/21/should-you-get-a-reverse-mortgage.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">reverse mortgage Opens a New Window.</a>(but be aware that the latter option comes with some serious <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/retirement/2016/10/01/how-safe-is-a-reverse-mortgage.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">drawbacks Opens a New Window.</a>).You can sell the house outright and move into a cheaper house or an apartment, using the funds from the sale for income. Or you can simply rent out a room and increase your income that way. The latter is a particularly good option if you live in a college town, as students are often desperate for cheap digs.</p> \n\n<p>When you start saving late, investments such as stocks and bonds have less time to accumulate returns and therefore provide a large base you can tap into for income. However, if you put that money into buying a rental property, you can have a steady stream of income for as long as you can keep tenants in the building. Whether or not this is a viable strategy will depend on your situation and on where you live; consult with your financial planner before making a firm decision to pursue real estate as an investment option.</p> \n\n<p>If you've waited until you're near retirement to start saving, you have a problem but it's not an insurmountable one. Add up your expenses, figure out how much income you'll need to get by in retirement, and then try one or more of the above ideas to reach that income goal. You may have to work a little harder at it than you would if you'd started saving in your 20s, but you still have a chance at a long, happy, and economically secure retirement.</p> \n\n<p>The $16,122 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known \"Social Security secrets\" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $16,122 more... each year!

The company said it was introducing a new metric to fix the problem.</p> \n\n<p>Some ad agency executives who were also informed by Facebook about the change started digging deeper, prompting Facebook to give them a more detailed account, one of the people familiar with the situation said.</p> \n\n<p>Ad buying agency Publicis Media was told by Facebook that the earlier counting method likely overestimated average time spent watching videos by between 60% and 80%, according to a late August letter Publicis Media sent to clients that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p> \n\n<p>A spokeswoman for Publicis Media, a division of Publicis Groupe SA, referred calls to Facebook. Publicis was responsible for purchasing roughly $77 billion in ads on behalf of marketers around the world in 2015, according to estimates from research firm RECMA.</p> \n\n<p>GroupM, the ad buying unit of WPP Plc, also was notified of the discrepancy by Facebook, another person familiar with the matter said.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>\"We recently discovered an error in the way we calculate one of our video metrics,\" Facebook said in a statement. \"This error has been fixed, it did not impact billing, and we have notified our partners both through our product dashboards and via sales and publisher outreach. We also renamed the metric to make it clearer what we measure. This metric is one of many our partners use to assess their video campaigns.\"</p> \n\n<p>The news is an embarrassment for Facebook, which has been touting the rapid growth of video consumption across its platform in recent years.</p> \n\n<p>Due to the miscalculated data, marketers may have misjudged the performance of video advertising they have purchased from Facebook over the past two years. It also may have impacted their decisions about how much to spend on Facebook video versus other video ad sellers such as Google's YouTube, Twitter, and even TV networks.</p> \n\n<p>Media companies and publishers are affected, too, since they've been given inaccurate data about the consumption of their video content across the social network. Many use that information to help determine the types of content they post.</p> \n\n<p>For the past two years Facebook only counted video views of more than three seconds when calculating its \"Average Duration of Video Viewed\" metric. Video views of under three seconds were not factored in, thereby inflating the average. Facebook's new metric, \"Average Watch Time\", will reflect video views of any duration. That will replace the earlier metric.</p> \n\n<p>In its note to clients, Publicis said the change was an attempt to obfuscate Facebook's earlier miscalculations.</p> \n\n<p>\"In an effort to distance themselves from the incorrect metrics, Facebook is deprecating [the old metrics] and introducing 'new' metrics in September. Essentially, they're coming up with new names for what they were meant to measure in the first place,\" the memo said.</p> \n\n<p>The miscounting could also fuel concerns among advertisers and media companies about the so-called \"walled gardens\" that companies including Facebook and Google are often described as operating. Both companies keep a tight grip on data, and only allow limited third-party tracking firms to plug into their systems.</p> \n\n<p>Keith Weed, chief marketing officer of Unilever, said in an interview last year, tech companies that don't let third parties measure their platforms is equivalent to \"letting them mark their own homework.\"</p> \n\n<p>The Publicis note said, \"This once again illuminates the absolute need to have 3rd party tagging and verification on Facebook's platform. Two years of reporting inflated performance numbers is unacceptable.\"</p> \n\n<p>Shalini Ramachandran contributed to this article.</p> \n\n<p>Write to Suzanne Vranica at suzanne.vranica@wsj.com and Jack Marshall at Jack.Marshall@wsj.com</p>", "title": "Facebook Overestimated Key Video Metric for Two Years", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/industries/2016/09/23/facebook-overestimated-key-video-metric-for-two-years622091.html", "published_at": "2016-09-23", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\"http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1602429/\" mce_href=\"http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1602429/\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Justin Timberlake has a tattoo on his ankle of Chinese characters representing the word &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ldquo;qu&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;rdquo; which translates to:&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span style=\"font-size:9px;\" mce_style=\"font-size:9px;\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;(&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\"http://www.polldaddy.com\" mce_href=\"http://www.polldaddy.com\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;online surveys&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;)&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;a href=\"http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1602436/\" mce_href=\"http://answers.polldaddy.com/poll/1602436/\"&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;Lindsay Lohan has the Italian phrase &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ldquo;La bella vita&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;rdquo; on her lower back.

Coupled with the Legislature&#8217;s relatively frictionless action on issues ranging from education funding to gun control and immigration, the statehouse found itself comparing favorably to dysfunction in Washington, D.C. &#8230;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Brown, the lunchtime speaker at the event, argued one reason for this success is that, through a series of ballot measures, Californians &#8220;broke a decade of dysfunction and laid the foundation for a government that actually works.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-jerry-brown-washington-20131024,0,6860597.story?track=rss#axzz2ih0vQZc5\" type=\"external\">Evan Halper</a> of the L.A. Times also today accepts the narrative that political process achievements are tantamount to real progress:</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;'Three years ago California was called a failed state,' [Gov. Brown] said. 'They were virtually chortling in the conservative venues.'</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Brown credited California&#8217;s turnaround to a series of ballot measures. The measures allowed a state budget to get passed with a simple majority of lawmakers, put an independent commission in charge of voting boundaries, and raised taxes by billions of dollars.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;'The people themselves through the initiative actually broke a decade of dysfunction and laid the foundation for a government that works,' he said.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>How is it good journalism to accept uncritically the idea that California is doing better because its political process is less contentious?</p> \n\n<p>How is it good journalism to focus on Brown's self-serving claims instead of the fact that California has the highest effective poverty rate in the nation? That California has the second-highest rate of people unable to find full-time work? Don't mass poverty and mass unemployment count as news?</p> \n\n<p>I honestly don't know how Siders and Halper can't understand the flimsiness of equating process success with real-life progress. Nor do I understand why mass economic misery is a non-story. But here's what one veteran Sacramento watcher told me the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">last time</a> I expressed frustration with the reporters covering the state:</p>", "title": "L.A. Times, Sac Bee: Political process success=real progress. Groan.", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://calwatchdog.com/2013/10/25/l-a-times-sac-bee-political-process-successreal-progress-groan/", "published_at": "2018-10-20", "bias": 3}, {"text": "<p>.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>That&#8217;s a pity. The Civil War can tell us a great deal about ourselves, then and now. We have an unfortunate history of plunging into wars for God and democracy that have often made a mockery of both. If we can use this anniversary to learn more about why we rush to war, it will be an exercise worth undertaking.</p> \n\n<p>More than 750,000 men died in the Civil War. Extrapolated to today&#8217;s population, the death toll would be close to 10 million. Most historians today would lament the casualties, but commend the outcome: the liberation of 4 million slaves.</p> \n\n<p>I disagree. The Civil War was not a just war. It was a war of choice brought on by the insidious mixture of politics and religion that caused our political process and, ultimately, the nation to disintegrate. The war&#8217;s outcome did indeed end slavery, but could we have achieved this noble objective without the slaughter? The U.S. was the only slaveholding nation to abolish the institution with a civil war.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Our government governs best from the center and depends upon compromise. By 1861, however, the Bible had replaced the Constitution as the arbiter of public policy, particularly over the issue of extending slavery in the Western territories. Framing slavery as a moral cause rendered compromise unlikely, for you cannot compromise with sin. The party in power, the Republicans, deployed evangelical dogma to raise the stakes of political discourse.</p> \n\n<p>The party&#8217;s ideology lay within the Second Great Awakening, a national religious revival begun in the early 1800s. Within a generation, nearly 40 percent of Americans who expressed a faith were members of evangelical Protestant denominations.</p> \n\n<p>In the North evangelicals used the Gospel not only to convert individuals, but also to reform society. They viewed America as a God-blessed nation, ordained to conquer a continent from sea to shining sea and spread democracy and Protestant Christianity across the land and, eventually, throughout the world.</p> \n\n<p>In order to accomplish this great objective, America must expiate its sins, foremost among them slavery and the Roman Catholic Church &#8211; two forms of despotism that undermined democracy and Christianity, according to Northern evangelicals. Historians have soft-pedaled the religious bigotry of Northern evangelicals and their allies, praising instead their antislavery position. However, you cannot discuss one without accounting for the other because they merged in the political arena.</p> \n\n<p>Beginning in the early 1840s small evangelical political parties emerged in the North demanding government action against slavery and the Catholic Church. Violent clashes of Protestant and Catholic gangs in the streets of major Northern and border cities accompanied the entrance of evangelical parties into the political system. One of the bloodiest sectarian riots occurred in New York City in July 1857, an event depicted in Martin Scorcese&#8217;s film &#8220;Gangs of New York.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>By the time of the New York m&#234;l&#233;e, the mixture of evangelical religion and politics was pervasive. Between 1847 and 1857, more than 1 million Irish Catholics emigrated to the United States to escape the potato famine. The sudden influx of Catholic immigrants alarmed evangelicals, especially those in the North. At the same time, the controversy over the extension of slavery in the territories worsened.</p> \n\n<p>Northerners concerned about the Catholic &#8220;invasion&#8221; and the &#8220;Slave Power&#8221; formed a new political party in the mid-1850s, the Republicans. In 1858, when Abraham Lincoln ran for the U.S. Senate in Illinois as the Republican candidate, the party cited &#8220;The Two Despotisms &#8211; Catholicism and Slavery &#8211; Their Union and Identity.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Lincoln was neither a religious bigot nor an evangelical Christian. But his speeches and writings in the late 1850s became increasingly messianic. His famous &#8220;House Divided&#8221; speech in 1858 derived from Matthew 12:25: &#8220;Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Self-righteousness eroded the vital center of American politics. Northerners and Southerners flung biblical verses at each other, deepening the divide. When the Republicans, avowedly evangelical and proudly sectional, took control of the government in March 1861, Southerners were rightly concerned to expect the worst. And the worst happened.</p> \n\n<p>Young men marched off to war as crusaders. But the horrors of the war soon overcame the recruits&#8217; religious zeal. At the Battle of Shiloh in April 1862, a Confederate soldier cursed the war he had once welcomed: &#8220;Oh! What suffering, what misery, what untold agony this horrid hell-begotten war has caused.&#8221; Soldiers at Shiloh witnessed the destructive potential of modern weaponry and outdated tactics: fields puddled with blood and strewn with dead men, animals tearing at their entrails. This is the war that often gets lost in the self-congratulatory narratives of the history books.</p> \n\n<p>And what of the former slaves, on whose behalf this carnage was allegedly undertaken? The Civil War sealed their freedom, but little else. It would be more than a century before African-Americans attained the basic rights of that freedom. In 1888, the 25th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, Frederick Douglass, the great black abolitionist, pronounced the document a &#8220;fraud.&#8221; The vast majority of blacks still toiled on the South&#8217;s farms and plantations.</p> \n\n<p>Might not peace, rather than war, have put an end to slavery and secured the rights of African-Americans much sooner?</p> \n\n<p>In commemorating the Civil War, we should remember that wars are easily made, difficult to end, and burdened with unintended consequences and unforeseen human casualties.</p> \n\n<p>We should also keep in mind that there is no higher law than the Constitution. That is America&#8217;s Scripture.</p> \n\n<p>David Goldfield is the author of &#8220;America Aflame: How the Civil War Created a Nation.&#8221; He wrote this for The Free Lance-Star in Fredericksburg, Va.

And why aren&#8217;t Romney and other Republicans moving to the political center as the election approaches?</p> \n\n<p>Both mysteries point to an important fact about the 2012 campaign: For conservatives, this is a go-for-broke election. They and a Republican Party now under their control hope to eke out a narrow victory in November on the basis of a quite radical program that includes more tax cuts for the rich, deep reductions in domestic spending, big increases in military spending, and a sharp rollback in government regulation.</p> \n\n<p>In the process, the right hopes to redefine middle-of-the-road policies as &#8220;left wing,&#8221; thereby altering the balance in the American political debate.</p> \n\n<p>What should alarm both liberals and moderates is that this is the rare election in which such a strategy has a chance of succeeding. Conservatives have their opening not because the country has moved far to the right but courtesy of economic discontent, partisan polarization and the right&#8217;s success in defining Obama as standing well to the left of where he actually does.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The Obama campaign is trying to disrupt this narrative on multiple fronts. Why did Obama respond so quickly and forcefully to Romney&#8217;s effort to use the president&#8217;s &#8220;you didn&#8217;t build that&#8221; quotation as a way of casting him as an enemy of small business? It&#8217;s not that the attack was true. In fact, it was blatantly false, given that in the same speech Obama praised &#8220;hard work,&#8221; &#8220;responsibility&#8221; and &#8220;individual initiative.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The words did, however, play to a stereotype of Obama as an advocate of big government who mistrusts business. The distortion resonated, said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster, because key voter groups that Romney is trying to win suspect the four words reflect &#8220;secretly what he [Obama] believes.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Moreover, Republicans want to recast the Obama campaign&#8217;s most effective line of attack &#8212; that Romney is a very wealthy out-of-touch financier who &#8220;pioneered&#8221; the outsourcing of jobs, kept a lot of money in foreign accounts, and refuses to release additional tax returns &#8212; as being less about Romney than about the president&#8217;s supposed hostility to &#8220;success&#8221; and to business. Much is riding on the interpretation (or willful misinterpretation) of a short sentence in a long speech.</p> \n\n<p>The go-for-broke strategy has a chance for another reason: In this election, the number of genuine, middle-of-the-road swing voters is very small. For both candidates, this puts a premium not only on high turnout among party base groups but also on very large victory margins within them. McInturff thinks we may be moving from an electoral model based on swing or undecided voters to a world of what he calls &#8220;committed versus elastic&#8221; voter groups.</p> \n\n<p>For example, it is widely agreed that white working-class voters will support Romney. But much depends upon Romney&#8217;s margin among them. If Obama holds Romney&#8217;s lead in the white working class to around 15 points, he likely wins. Romney can win if he pushes his advantage with these less well-off voters to 25 points or more. Obama&#8217;s Bain/tax returns offensive against Romney is aimed directly at this constituency.</p> \n\n<p>Similarly, Romney will lose the Latino vote by a landslide. But holding his deficit to, say, 30 points instead of 40 will matter. And by portraying Obama as anti-business, McInturff said, Romney could gain ground among college-educated white men. In the pollster&#8217;s terms, what matters is the &#8220;elasticity&#8221; in all these constituencies.</p> \n\n<p>The potential flaw in the conservative strategy could turn out to be reality itself. Obama&#8217;s actual record is neither left wing nor anti-business. Public opinion is strongly hostile to many items on the conservative agenda. Most voters, for example, reject the idea that more tax cuts for the wealthy are central to future prosperity. Much of the domestic spending that Republicans would reduce has strong support, one reason Romney avoids budget specifics.</p> \n\n<p>Republicans want to play down the implications of what they would do in power and paint Obama as someone he isn&#8217;t. Normally, this strategy wouldn&#8217;t work. But this is a moment when abnormal levels of economic turmoil are feeding a profound mistrust of government. Conservatives are making a large bet that if ever there was a year when they could mainstream out-of-the-mainstream ideas, this is it.</p> \n\n<p>E.J.

Oil, of course.</p> \n\n<p>Libya is the world's 17th-largest producer of the stuff, and there's a growing expectation among some analysts that with the conflict perhaps coming to a close, Libyan oil production will rapidly increase.&amp;#160;That, in turn, would lower oil prices and, eventually, lead to a drop in gasoline prices in the U.S., the world's largest economy.</p> \n\n<p>In short: the fall of Gaddafi could end up giving Americans what amounts to a big fat tax cut.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>More from GlobalPost: <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/photo-galleries/planet-pic/5673627/photos-libyans-celebrate-rebels-take-tripoli\" type=\"external\">Photos:</a> <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/photo-galleries/planet-pic/5673627/photos-libyans-celebrate-rebels-take-tripoli\" type=\"external\">Libyans celebrate as rebels take Tripoli</a></p> \n\n<p>David Kotok, the chairman and chief executive of Cumberland Advisors <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/libya-oil-prices-will-tank-stock-prices-will-soar-2011-8#ixzz1VlV4jkz9\" type=\"external\">makes the case in Business Insider</a>:</p> \n\n<p>Libyan oil production will ramp up. As it does, oil prices in world markets will fall and oil futures markets will reflect the expected increase in production of oil from Libya...We expect oil prices to fall when highly desirable, sweet Libyan crude production is fully resumed and enters the pipeline. Maybe, they are going to fall by a lot. This will come as a much-needed boost to the US economy and to others in the world.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Remember: the oil price acts like a sales tax on consumption. To clarify this relationship we convert crude oil prices to gasoline prices and then estimate what a change in gas price will mean for the American consumer. Roughly, a penny drop in the gas price per gallon gives Americans 1.4 billion more dollars a year to spend on other than gasoline. That is a huge stimulant to the economy. The ratio is different in Europe because the gas taxes are so much higher there. Nevertheless, it is still significant.</p> \n\n<p>Lower gas prices could not come at a more needed time. With weakening economies around the developed world, the lowering of the consumption \"tax\" from high oil prices will be a welcome boost. In the US, it is possible we will see gas prices with a $2 handle, instead of the $4 handle of a few months ago. This is a large positive change for the US economy, and it is not being incorporated in the gloomy forecasts that we see.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Of course, not everyone holds this rosy view.</p> \n\n<p>\"I see the price coming down on Brent as more of a knee jerk reaction,\" author and former oil trader <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2011/08/22/markets/oil_libya/\" type=\"external\">Dan Dicker told CNNMoney</a>, estimating that it will take a long time for Libyan oil to flow back into the market. \"You're not going to see a barrel of oil from Libya for at least a year.\"&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>More from GlobalPost: <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/110822/tripoli-muammar-al-gaddafi-oil-libya-news-eni-gas\" type=\"external\">Italian oil company leads charge back into Libya</a></p> \n\n<p>Manouchehr Takin, senior petroleum analyst at the Center for Global Energy Studies in London, also told CNNMoney that Libya's resumption of production is more likely to be a gradual flow.</p> \n\n<p>\"The state of the oil infrastructure in Libya remains uncertain, he said, and there could be unforeseen factors that would interfere with the resumption of production,\" CNNMoney reported.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Oil prices today have been volatile.

The terrorist organization ordered the population of the city to remain in doors. The city of some 140,000 (many of them refugees from Homs and other urban centers damaged by the civil war) fell to Daesh on Wednesday, marking the second city conquered by the organization this week (Ramadi in Iraq fell to them on Sunday).</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>On Thursday, Daesh forces took two villages outside Palmyra on the road to Damascus, <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.net/news/arabic/2015/5/22/%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%B8%D9%8A%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%88%D8%B3%D8%B9-%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%B7-%D8%AA%D8%AF%D9%85%D8%B1-%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%84-%D8%B9%D8%B4%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D9%88%D8%AF%20\" type=\"external\">claiming to have killed 50 Syrian Arab Army troops who were attempt to flee to Homs.</a></p> \n\n<p>For Syrians, Palmyra is famous not only for its historical ruins but more darkly as the site of the notorious Tadmor Prison, where Muslim fundamentalists were imprisoned, including for thought crimes, and torture was practiced intensively. The regime is said to have moved the prisoners to a secret location before the city fell.</p> \n\n<p>Personally, I disagree with those analysts suggesting that Palmyra is a strategic asset or that its fall brings Daesh to the gates of Damascus. It is a small town out in the eastern desert away from the population centers along the western border of Syria. Two-thirds of Syrians live in the corridors linking Damascus to Latakia and Aleppo via Homs. Daesh isn&#8217;t all that much closer to Damascus than it was in southern Raqqa province already. Maybe having it improves the organization&#8217;s logistics with its assets in Iraq, but that is about it. Some observers are also claiming that Daesh now controls half of Syrian territory. But that is a silly way of counting things. The eastern desert is sparsely populated and it isn&#8217;t even clear what &#8216;controlling&#8217; it would mean. The scorpions and lizards wave black banners? What Daesh controls is mostly white <a href=\"http://gulf2000.columbia.edu/images/maps/Syria_Ethnic_1935_lg.png%20\" type=\"external\">in the below ethnic map of Syria</a> (i.e. unpopulated).</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.juancole.com/images/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-22-at-2.44.30-AM.png\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>The more colorful spots are non-Sunni ethnic minorities like the Druze, Alawites, Christians, etc. However tired these groups might be of the war, they will go to Israeli-style mass citizen mobilization before they will accept being conquered by Daesh. That is, the al-Assad regime may well fall in the end, but the conquest of Palmyra by Daesh does not actually indicate that fall is imminent.</p> \n\n<p>Many Syrians on Twitter are complaining that world leaders like President Francois Hollande of France are all of a sudden energized about Syria now that Palmyra has fallen to Daesh, because of the organization&#8217;s iconoclastic policies and the danger it will destroy the Roman ruins. They want to know where Hollande has been while over 200,000 Syrians were killed in the civil war.</p> \n\n<p>The big question is how Daesh, supposedly being bombed by coalition aircraft, was allowed to send out a substantial convoy down desert roads to Palmyra from Raqqa. The Pentagon has been issuing statistics on so many bombing raids etc. for months, but unless the bombing is degrading Daesh&#8217;s capabilities then it is a waste of taxpayer money. In Kobane, the bombing succeeded in keeping the city out of Daesh hands because Kurdish Marxist guerrillas also fought it on the ground. But the US can hardly give the genocidal al-Assad regime close air support. Without a ground force to support, the US bombing is merely symbolic.</p> \n\n<p>The situation is different in Iraq, where US and coalition bombing raids have helped push Daesh back in Diyala, Salahuddin and Ninewa Provinces, in conjunction with ground operations by Kurdish Peshmerga or the Iraqi army and its Shiite paramilitaries. In that context, the fall of Ramadi was probably preventable with the right coordination. In Syria, I don&#8217;t see the US aerial intervention as so far having been consequential.</p> \n\n<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p> \n\n<p>Related video:</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/JrsJturkS7s%20\" type=\"external\">Associated Press: &#8221;Ancient City of Palmyra Falls to IS Militants&#8221;</a></p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />", "title": "Islamic State Beheaded Dozens in Palmyra, but How Strategic Is the City?", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/islamic-state-beheaded-dozens-in-palmyra-but-how-strategic-is-the-city/", "published_at": "2015-05-23", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>Your daily look at late-breaking California news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about today:</p> \n\n<p>1.

Preparing for the worst, companies should also have plans in place in the event of a massive outbreak.</p> \n\n<p>That includes, if possible, not running at full capacity by building inventories, as well as taking appropriate measures to shift to telecom mode if necessary by giving employees the ability to efficiently set up shop and work from home.</p> \n\n<p>Lastly, companies that host flu vaccinations, promote the importance of getting vaccinated and cut down on meetings when a flu outbreak begins are ahead of the game, Challenger said.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Worst Flu Season in a Decade Could Cost Employers Billions", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2013/01/09/worsening-flu-season-could-costs-companies-billions.html", "published_at": "2013-01-09", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>Somehow, by some miracle, the California Legislature has confirmed Senator Abel Maldonado as Lieutenant Governor, ending five months of political drama and maneuvering that rivaled President Obama&#8217;s push for healthcare reform.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Senator Maldonado is a model of post-partisanship, reaching across the aisle to improve education and strengthen public safety,&#8221; Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said in <a href=\"http://gov.ca.gov/press-release/14997\" type=\"external\">this press release</a>, apparently forgetting &#8212; like the legislators who dragged this whole sorry business on month after month &#8212; that as lieutenant governor, Maldonado is constitutionally prohibited from doing anything more than opening shopping malls, smiling gratuitously and exploring other open seats to run for.</p> \n\n<p>What?

Obama has endorsed that situation by again referring to the torture as just the actions of &#8220;a few people.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It was hardly that, however, and he knows it. Torture was a major part of the Bush/Cheney so-called &#8220;War&#8221; on Terror, and was being conducted on an industrial scale, with White House lawyers providing legal cover, the Secretary of Defense sending memos urging every more aggressive techniques, and government doctors and psychologists working assiduously to make them more &#8220;effective.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The illogic of Obama&#8217;s position on these photos is stunning. Since we know the photos exist, the refusal to make them public can only feed a sense that they must be worse than the horrific photos of torture at Abu Ghraib Prison which were already released. Nobody is going to assume that the photos in the White House&#8217;s possession are less offensive than what has already been discovered and made public&#8211;for why would the administration be worried about that?</p> \n\n<p>The truth is always better than a cover-up, and what we now have the president advocating is a cover-up of American torture.</p> \n\n<p>But that&#8217;s only part of the president&#8217;s slide into Cheneyism. We have the president now calling for the possible indefinite detention of terror suspects&#8211;an idea that only insures that there will always be an incentive for recruiting more terrorists (to avenge those in captivity)&#8211;and that makes a joke of our own Constitution, which guarantees everyone&#8211;not just citizens&#8211;the right to a trial, the right to a presumption of innocence, and protection from &#8220;cruel and unusual punishment,&#8221; which indefinite detention certainly is.</p> \n\n<p>The war in Afghanistan, which now must be called Obama&#8217;s War, thanks to his policy of escalation, is also becoming Cheneyesque, with the firing of Gen. David McKiernan, and his replacement as head of the Afghanistan War by Gen. Stanley McChrystal. Gen. McChrystal hails from the Special Forces, and played a role in the torture that was integral to the US war and occupation in Iraq.&amp;#160; Far from being put in charge of operations in Afghanistan, where public backing for the US military is virtually non-existent at this point, McChrystal should be facing investigation and possible prosecution here at home for his role in torture of captives.</p> \n\n<p>It has never made sense to initiate a war in Afghanistan in order to go after a band of criminal terrorists hidiing out in the mountains. Bush and Cheney turned what should have been a focused hunt for Al Qaeda terrorists into a war on the Taliban government and ultimately the people of Afghanistan.&amp;#160; Obama has continued that error, and now blithely hyphenates the terms Al Qaeda and Taliban in defining the &#8220;enemy&#8221; of American forces in that country.</p> \n\n<p>Such a war can never be won, and can only lead to tragedy, not just for the people of Afghanistan, for whom it is already that, but for American troops and ultimately for America itself.</p> \n\n<p>It is a war that never should have been fought, and which now should be ended as rapidly as possible.</p> \n\n<p>Obama at this point, by covering up for official torture, and by signing on to and expanding the war in Afghanistan, is dooming his presidency, further staining the reputation of the United States, and ultimately furthering the decline of the country that was set in motion by his predecessors.</p> \n\n<p>DAVE LINDORFF is a Philadelphia-based journalist and columnist.

The deal, which is valued at $1.25 billion at list prices, will convert 10 of the airline&#8217;s current 737 MAXs on order to the newest version of the jet.</p> \n\n<p>Additionally, the prime minister said his government would try to &#8220;persuade&#8221; Malaysia&#8217;s long-haul budget carrier AirAsia to switch to General Electric (NYSE:GE) engines. In June, one of the airline&#8217;s flights from Malaysia to Perth, Australia was <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/06/25/airasia-pilot-calls-on-passengers-to-pray-amid-engine-trouble-on-flight.html\" type=\"external\">forced to turn around Opens a New Window.</a> due to a &#8220;technical issue,&#8221; after its Airbus A330-300 aircraft experienced a problem with one of its Rolls-Royce engines.</p> \n\n<p>Boeing did not have comment regarding Prime Minister Razak's remarks.

As of 11:48 a.m. ET, the stock was up 14%.</p> \n\n<p>So what: The fast-food chainhad tumbled following its prior earnings report on competition fromMcDonald'sall-day breakfast, but today the chain was helped by Qdoba, its Mexican-food chain andChipotlecompetitor. The fast-food chain posted an adjusted earnings per share of $0.84, up from $0.61 and ahead of estimates at $0.70, while revenue improved 0.8% to $361.2 million, essentially in line with expectations.</p> \n\n<p>Same-store sales at Jack in the Box restaurants were flat in the quarter, but grew 2.1% at Qdoba. Profits improved as the company eliminated close to $6 million in SG&amp;amp;A expenses as it worked to control costs.</p> \n\n<p>CEO Lenny Comma said, \"Operating earnings per share exceeded our expectations and guidance,\" benefiting from cost controls and improved margins.</p> \n\n<p>Now what: Jack in the Box's guidance was not particularly inspiring. The company expects same-store sales of flat to 1% at Jack in the Box locations and 1.5%-2.5% at Qdoba restaurants. The guidance may be due to its lapping a strong year of same-store sales growth, and that it still sees earnings per share improving close to 20%, projecting a range of $3.50-$3.63 for the year as it continues to make improvements in its cost structure. Still, I'd like to see more robust sales growth before diving into the stock.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>The article <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/05/12/why-jack-in-the-box-inc-shares-bounced-back-today.aspx\" type=\"external\">Why Jack in the Box Inc.

Outside governments and analysts concurred the North had made a jump in missile capability.</p> \n\n<p>A resumption of Pyongyang&#8217;s torrid testing pace in pursuit of its goal of a viable arsenal of nuclear-tipped missiles that can hit the U.S. mainland had been widely expected, but the power of the missile and suddenness of the test still jolted the Korean Peninsula and Washington. The launch at 3:17 a.m. local time and midday in the U.S. capital indicated an effort to perfect the element of surprise and to obtain maximum attention in the United States.</p> \n\n<p>In a government statement released through state media, North Korea said the Hwasong-15, the &#8220;greatest ICBM,&#8221; could be armed with a &#8220;super-large heavy nuclear warhead&#8221; and is capable of striking the &#8220;whole mainland&#8221; of the United States. The North said the missile reached a height of 4,475 kilometers (2,780 miles) and traveled 950 kilometers (590 miles) before accurately hitting a sea target, similar to the flight data announced by South Korea&#8217;s military.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>It said leader Kim Jong Un after the successful launch &#8220;declared with pride&#8221; that the country has achieved its goal of becoming a &#8220;rocket power.&#8221; State TV said Kim gave the order on Tuesday and broadcast a photo of Kim&#8217;s signed order where he wrote: &#8220;Test launch is approved. Taking place at the daybreak of Nov. 29! Fire with courage for the party and country!&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The firing is a clear message of defiance aimed at the Trump administration, which a week earlier had restored North Korea to a U.S. list of terror sponsors. It also ruins nascent diplomatic efforts, raises fears of war or a pre-emptive U.S. strike and casts a deeper shadow over the security of the Winter Olympics early next year in South Korea.</p> \n\n<p>A rattled Seoul responded by almost immediately launching three of its own missiles in a show of force. President Moon Jae-in expressed worry North Korea&#8217;s missile threat could force the United States to attack the North before it masters a nuclear-tipped long-range missile, something experts say may be imminent.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;If North Korea completes a ballistic missile that could reach from one continent to another, the situation can spiral out of control,&#8221; Moon said at an emergency meeting in Seoul, according to his office. &#8220;We must stop a situation where North Korea miscalculates and threatens us with nuclear weapons or where the United States considers a pre-emptive strike.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Moon has repeatedly declared the U.S. cannot attack the North without Seoul&#8217;s approval, but many here worry Washington may act without South Korean input.</p> \n\n<p>The launch was North Korea&#8217;s first since it fired an intermediate-range missile over Japan on Sept. 15 and may have broken any efforts at diplomacy. U.S. officials have sporadically floated the idea of direct talks with North Korea if it maintained restraint.</p> \n\n<p>The missile also appears to improve on North Korea&#8217;s past launches.</p> \n\n<p>If flown on a standard trajectory, instead of Wednesday&#8217;s lofted angle, the missile would have a range of more than 13,000 kilometers (8,100 miles), said U.S. scientist David Wright, a physicist who closely tracks North Korea&#8217;s missile and nuclear programs. &#8220;Such a missile would have more than enough range to reach Washington, D.C., and in fact any part of the continental United States,&#8221; Wright wrote in a blog post for the Union for Concerned Scientists.</p> \n\n<p>North Korea&#8217;s description of a &#8220;super-large heavy&#8221; warhead could raise debate on whether it plans another nuclear test to demonstrate it has such a weapon. When the North flight-tested two of its older ICBM models, the Hwasong-14s, in July, it said the missiles were capable of delivering &#8220;large-sized heavy&#8221; warheads. The North went on to conduct its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sept. 3, which it described as a detonation of a weapon built for ICBMs.</p> \n\n<p>South Korea&#8217;s National Intelligence Service told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing the possibility of a nuclear test &#8220;cannot be discounted,&#8221; lawmaker Kim Byung-kee said.</p> \n\n<p>The missile was launched from near Pyongyang, and Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said it landed inside of Japan&#8217;s special economic zone in the Sea of Japan, about 250 kilometers (155 miles) west of Aomori, which is on the northern part of Japan&#8217;s main island of Honshu.</p> \n\n<p>A big unknown, however, is the missile&#8217;s payload. If, as expected, it carried a light mock warhead, then its effective range would have been shorter, analysts said.</p> \n\n<p>The analyses of Wednesday&#8217;s test suggest progress by Pyongyang in developing a weapon of mass destruction that could strike the U.S. mainland. President Donald Trump has vowed to prevent North Korea from having that capability &#8212; using military force if necessary.</p> \n\n<p>Kim Dong-yub, a former South Korean military official who is now an analyst at Seoul&#8217;s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the missile is likely an upgraded version of its old ICBM with an enhanced second-stage. He believes the North will try to evaluate the weapon&#8217;s performance, including the warhead&#8217;s ability to survive atmospheric re-entry and strike the intended target, before it attempts a test that shows the full range of the missile.</p> \n\n<p>In response to the launch, Trump said the United States will &#8220;take care of it.&#8221; He told reporters after the launch: &#8220;It is a situation that we will handle.&#8221; He did not elaborate.</p> \n\n<p>The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Wednesday afternoon at the request of Japan, the U.S. and South Korea.</p> \n\n<p>When the Trump administration declared North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism, the U.S. also imposed new sanctions on North Korean shipping firms and Chinese trading companies dealing with the North. North Korea called the terror designation a &#8220;serious provocation&#8221; that justifies its development of nuclear weapons.</p> \n\n<p>South Koreans are famously nonchalant about North Korea&#8217;s military moves, but there is worry about what the North&#8217;s weapons tests might mean for next year&#8217;s Winter Olympics in the South. Moon ordered a close review of whether the launch could hurt South Korea&#8217;s efforts to successfully host the games in Pyeongchang, which begin Feb. 9.</p> \n\n<p>Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who spoke with Trump, said Japan will not back down against any provocation and would maximize pressure on the North in its strong alliance with the U.S.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Associated Press writers Matthew Pennington, Lolita C.

One of the first things you should figure out is where it&#8217;s best to place them. The ability to set timers makes them useful in the kitchen. Their function as speakers makes them good for the living room. Being able to set alarms makes them pretty handy on your nightstand. Think carefully about how you think you&#8217;ll use the home hub in your everyday life and place accordingly.</p> \n\n<p>If, in a couple of days, you find you aren&#8217;t using the gadget that much, consider moving it to another location where you might get more use from it. You may find it&#8217;s almost useless by your bed, but becomes incredibly useful once you move it to your kitchen &#8211; or vice versa.</p> \n\n<p>(Amazon makes the Echo and Echo Dot; Jeffrey P. Bezos is the chief executive of Amazon and owner of The Washington Post.)</p> \n\n<p>&#8211;Think about links. While both the Echo and the Google Home are pretty cool on their own, the real magic happens when you start linking them to other devices. For example, you can yell out requests to the Home to turn on your television if you link it to Google&#8217;s Chromecast streaming device. You can link your Netflix account to Google Home now, as well as YouTube. Many other services including Uber and Domino&#8217;s Pizza also work with the Home.</p> \n\n<p>The Echo can link with Uber, Domino&#8217;s Pizza and some music services. It also directly links with your Amazon account, making it possible to ask Echo to add things to your wish list for the site or even order some products. It doubles as a Bluetooth speaker if you want to play your audio through the Echo, but it lacks the video controls that the Home has with Netflix and YouTube.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Both home hubs can link with smart lights and the Nest thermostat, as well as other smart home products. If you&#8217;ve taken the plunge into the smart home, these hubs can prove enormously convenient for turning &#8220;the lights off in the bedroom&#8221; or bringing your house&#8217;s temperature down for bedtime.</p> \n\n<p>The bottom line is that if you want to get your money&#8217;s worth, then you should connect the smart speakers to an Amazon or Google account if you have one. But if you are worried about privacy &#8211; particularly your voice history &#8211; there is a way to delete queries the home hubs have heard from your device. For Echo, the &#8220;Home&#8221; feed will display everything you&#8217;ve asked Echo to do; to delete any individual request, tap on the &#8220;More&#8221; in the lower right-hand corner and hit &#8220;Remove card.&#8221; On Home, go into your device&#8217;s settings and scroll down to &#8220;My Activity.&#8221; From there you will be able to delete requests by hitting the icon that looks like three dots in a vertical line at the top of the screen.</p> \n\n<p>&#8211;Really dive into those apps. After testing out your smart hub for some time, you may start to wonder, &#8220;What am I really going to use this thing for?&#8221; It&#8217;s a good question. Once the novelty of asking your home hub what time it is wears off, you may wonder what it&#8217;s really capable of. So before you fall out of love, dive into the apps that link your home hub to your phone and dig around for the most useful applications. You may find that you really want daily news briefings, a summary of your schedule for the day or the option to play a round of &#8220;Jeopardy!&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>On Google Home, head into the settings menu for the hub and tap &#8220;More&#8221; to get a full list of the things your hub can do and the services with which it can connect. (One of my favorites is to get recipes emailed from the Food Network.) On the Echo&#8217;s Alexa app &#8211; named for the voice assistant &#8211; this list is tucked into the &#8220;Things to Try&#8221; category, which tells you more about the basic operation of your Echo, or head to the &#8220;Skills&#8221; section to get a long list of the things the Echo can do.</p> \n\n<p>tech-home</p>", "title": "Did you just open a brand new home hub?

Do something!&#8221; But there&#8217;s not one f&#8217;ing asshole on the whole God damned bus who can act. I know, scientists are revealing truths, politicians scheming and babbling incoherently, but hey, who is shitting whom? All that means jack. It&#8217;s out of f&#8217;ing control! It&#8217;s obvious. The land of the free and the home of the brave? No man, it&#8217;s an improvised explosive device tied to a runaway bus. Where is right and where wrong? Who the fuck&#8217;s got his finger on the nukes? Two to one his other finger is up his ass. What&#8217;s the dot gov doing man? The vehicle is smashing into people, wrecking countries. What for? Democracy? Excuse me? It is death in the largefamily size, plain and simple. And the family is your family, Buddy..</p> \n\n<p>The whole world watches with horror while this out-of-control motherfucker careens down the mountain. This sad remains of a country is smashing everything up. I know, I know, it&#8217;s the deep state, pulling levers, wrenching the wheel, pumping pedals but it don&#8217;t mean shit. That&#8217;s because the deep-state is bonkers, stupid, vicious and never learned to drive an out-of-control motherfucker like this baby. That is, if the deep-state exists. I mean who the fuck knows? Anyway, the shit they pull, if they really pull shit, is not going to save their asses let alone yours.</p> \n\n<p>So why is the deep-state still in control? What keeps the deep-state in control of this out-of-control mother fucker? Assuming they exist of course. Nothing about them is legitimate. The whole dot gov thing is a punch and judy show with a stick of dynamite up its ass. Secretly, behind the scenes the deep state is babbling out of f&#8217;ing control. They are hopeless on every count. Still they slip the bullshit to the bullshitters and everyone toddles along behind.</p> \n\n<p>How does it work? How does the bullshit get to the bullshitter. Deep-state guys must tell non-deep-state guys to do things, or convey to them that they should do things in some circuitous underhand deep-state way, right? That is if there really are deep-state guys. I mean it&#8217;s non-deep-state guys who actually do the dirty work, correct? Deep-state guys don&#8217;t actually do shit. Deep-state guys get things done with hints and signs and shit and who knows what to signal their pleasure or displeasure to non-deep-state guys who toddle off in service to the deep state guys who may or may not exist. Non-deep-state guys learn to divine deep-state guys&#8217; desires even without nods and winks and whatever. It&#8217;s all one big bollocks of bosses and lackeys and subtle hints and raised eyebrows and gobs of hypocrisy to cover over a cuckoo, vicious, moronic, and totally fucked up pile of deep-state shit. Of course now I&#8217;m talking about the highest level.</p> \n\n<p>But deep-state guys, if they exist, are still just guys, right? I mean, they are just guys! Why are those non-deep-state guys kissing their butts? Given the obvious cluelessness of the deep-state guys hinting the planet into the crapper, isn&#8217;t your obedience a little, how should I put it, dumb? I know those deep-state guys are awesome, but come on. It&#8217;s just habit, isn&#8217;t it? I mean the USA, aside from being this out-of-control bomb, is now just a bad habit, isn&#8217;t it? Courts? Elections? Constitution? Forget about it. It&#8217;s just habit. There&#8217;s no rhyme or reason, even for the deep-state guys. And given that it&#8217;s taking us to the crapper, a bad habit. Forget about the founding fathers, this shit is really happening, dude.</p> \n\n<p>I suppose you could get money and power so-called from sucking up, but is that enough to trade for species extinction? What good is toddling along behind the deep state guys on a planet cooked well-done? Why not, as Nancy Reagan put it, just say no? Okay, deep-state guys will be deep-state guys. I sure as hell am not going to talk them out of it, even though they are being stupid. They are going to deep-state themselves right into deep do do, assuming they exist. But you, kid, you! Are you ready to crash headfirst into eternity? Is this a new sexual orientation?</p> \n\n<p>Now I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t need any more proof that everything is fucked up and on the way to the crapper. All roads lead to shit. That, I think, is one thing everyone can agree to. The bedrock of civilized conversation. So that&#8217;s why I skipped that part. Maybe it&#8217;s a hundred years, maybe two hundred. It&#8217;s hard to imagine more. Most likely much less, more like fifteen or two, but what do I know? After whatever, eternity. The difference is the difference of a blink of an eye. Anyway, what I want to ask is, is that okay with you?</p> \n\n<p>Now before you get your knickers in a twist let me just say I am not trying to get you to do anything you don&#8217;t want to do. I&#8217;m not going to say, &#8220;it&#8217;s all going to shit unless&#8230;&#8221; Unless..? No, buddy. I don&#8217;t think there is an &#8220;unless&#8221;. Disabuse yourself of that &#8220;unless&#8221;. We&#8217;re headed for the crapper. Period, full stop.</p> \n\n<p>Don&#8217;t believe me? Still of the what-me-worry persuasion? How about alternative fuels? If we are gobbling down energy of any kind we will burn hydrocarbons. If nobody is using them they will be cheap. Laws won&#8217;t stop deep-state people from finding a way to make a buck. And poverty makes laws disappear. In industrial civilization we always want more&#8211; vacations, houses, cars, entertainment. And industrial civilization needs to sell us more. Chug all the alternative fuels you want, we will still want more. We will fight for more and so need armies, navies and cyber-warriors. Militaries will use hydrocarbons and fuck you if you don&#8217;t like it. If it&#8217;s there we will use it. Industrial civilization always needs more. Only the end of industrial civilization will end hydrocarbon burning and that ain&#8217;t happening, buster. No, babe, the rock has begun to roll. It would take an absolute all-out mobilization of the entire species in a unified well-organized crash-course of action to eliminate industrial civilization without blowing up the world to give the planet even the ghost of a chance of a snowball in a steaming pile of shit. So that all-out effort will almost certainly fail. I hope that&#8217;s not too alarmist.</p> \n\n<p>So no, I don&#8217;t expect you to do anything, Buddy. Put your mind to rest. The planet is barbecuing, shit is spreading, people are getting upset, and the deep-state is doubling down in order to pursue an astonishingly stupid mind-fuck of world-domination, &#8212; unless they don&#8217;t exist in which case nobody is steering the fucking bus. Put it all together and it spells bye-bye.</p> \n\n<p>Hey, know what? Every deep-state guy, if he exists, is pursuing a sub-rosa scheme to feather a tropical-island bolt-hole nest a la Saddam. A comfy little hidey-hole for our bird-brained leaders. They plan to skip out and lay low in style when whatever hits the whatever. Maybe you can flap your way to one of those with them? Kiss the right ass and win a trip to cloud-cuckoo land. When the champagne runs out and they scamper aboard their jets maybe you can hitch a ride as drink steward or just stow away like a bed bug.</p> \n\n<p>Of course that won&#8217;t last long. In the end you just dry up into a parasite&#8217;s remains, the fossil of an exoskeleton. Is that what you want, Buddy? To end up as a kind of parasitic remains? This, I admit, is what I am worried about. You, Buddy, you! Buddy, you&#8217;re not a tapeworm. You&#8217;re better than that. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to make this all-out last-ditch effort even if it is, in all likelihood, futile? Wouldn&#8217;t that be a better, a nobler way to go than sucking blood til the earth runs dry! Killing people, destroying cities, fucking up every place you are not? So if you think it would be a good idea to make this effort, it might be worthwhile to ask just what this effort would entail.

The organization and other consumer groups opposed the request, saying it could make food less safe and pose risks to meat plant workers, who already deal with higher rates of injury than other industries. The union says it remains \"concerned\" that the USDA plans to let some chicken plants apply to run processing lines at speeds up to 175 birds a minute, with most currently capped at 140.

USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service says the chicken industry group's Sept. 1 petition to eliminate speed limits in chicken plants didn't demonstrate that inspectors could effectively check each carcass for safety at speeds beyond 175 birds a minute--nearly three chickens a second. But FSIS said that the agency plans to lay out criteria for poultry plants, most of which are limited to processing 140 chickens each minute, to run at speeds up to 175, as long as they demonstrate how they will assess food safety and meet other criteria.

That and his power position in the House earn him high marks from the National Rifle Association. In 1993-94, the NRA spent more than $4.7 million to help the Republicans take over Congress. And no other member of the House owes as much to the gun group as Barr. The NRA hand-picked him for the primary and then, in a move motivated by revenge, helped him defeat veteran Democrat Buddy Darden in November.</p> \n\n<p>Early in 1994, when Barr began his run for Congress, the NRA provided his campaign with critical support and worked closely with him to get out the vote, knowing that with the low turnout expected for the off-year primary, it could make the difference. The Georgia Gun Owners&#8217; PAC, which received funds from the NRA, also threw its support behind Barr and provided $5,000 in crucial money for the primary race. Barr won handily.</p> \n\n<p>The NRA put $4,950 more into Barr&#8217;s campaign coffers when he moved on to face Darden in the general election. During his 11 previous years in Congress, Darden had enjoyed the NRA&#8217;s backing. But not this time. Darden, annoyed at the organization&#8217;s backroom maneuvering, had voted for the president&#8217;s 1994 crime bill, which included the assault weapons ban. &#8220;The NRA decided to make an example of Buddy Darden, as a warning to others,&#8221; says a leading Democratic strategist in Georgia. (A similar scenario played out in Texas, where <a href=\"/news/special_reports/1996/09/stockman.html\" type=\"external\">Steve Stockman</a> defeated Rep. Jack Brooks, a longtime NRA friend.)</p> \n\n<p>The NRA backed Barr&#8217;s campaign even though he seemed vulnerable on the &#8220;character&#8221; issue. Married three times and embroiled in a messy court battle with his second wife over his failure to pay child support, Barr had been photographed in 1992 licking whipped cream off two buxom young women&#8217;s chests. And this from the man who would later sponsor the Defense of Marriage Act.</p> \n\n<p>But with the support of a far-right coalition including elements of the NRA, the John Birch Society, the Christian Coalition, and the National Right to Life Committee, Barr won the election with 52 percent of the vote. The payoff for the NRA came in early 1995, when Newt Gingrich appointed a task force to examine firearms legislation. At the NRA&#8217;s urging, the speaker named Barr to head the task force.</p> \n\n<p>Barr&#8217;s agenda is unabashedly pro-NRA. He proposes abolishing the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and revoking the Brady Bill that requires waiting periods for the purchase of handguns. This summer he stumped for a bill that eliminated funding for research at the Centers for Disease Control on gun-related fatalities. &#8220;[The CDC has] not eradicated disease,&#8221; said Barr. &#8220;They have work left to do.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Most importantly, he engineered the March 22 House vote repealing the ban on semiautomatic assault weapons. &#8220;It was Bob Barr&#8217;s job to get it done, and he did,&#8221; says <a href=\"/news/feature/1996/07/dreyfuss.html\" type=\"external\">Neal Knox</a>, the NRA&#8217;s first vice president.</p> \n\n<p>Three times, Barr charged up the Hill to push the repeal vote. He managed to get a vote scheduled for May 1995, but it was taken off the agenda after the Oklahoma City bombing. Last fall, Barr organized more than 100 of his colleagues, Democrats as well as Republicans, to repeal the ban. But his effort got lost in the furor over the 1996 budget.</p> \n\n<p>Finally, in early March this year, Barr had lined up enough House members to force a vote. With only two hours scheduled for debate, and no committee hearings, the bill passed 239-173.

Slurring millions of people as rapists, terrorists and freeloaders, Donald Trump promised, along with the infamous wall on the southern border and a ban of Muslims, tens of thousands of deportations and the seizure of money that people in the US send to families in Mexico. Distressing as all of this is in itself, it&#8217;s coming after years that have already seen many, many family-severing deportations and a struggle to enact reforms.</p> \n\n<p>So what now? Joining us to talk about what&#8217;s needed and what&#8217;s being done is Kica Matos, director of immigrant rights and racial justice at the Center for Community Change. She joins us by phone from Connecticut. Welcome to CounterSpin, Kica Matos.</p> \n\n<p>Kica Matos: Thank you for having me.</p> \n\n<p>JJ: Let me ask you first: Some are saying&#8212;I think wishfully&#8212;oh, he can&#8217;t possibly do everything he talked about. But the array of harms that a Trump presidency represents for immigrant communities, undocumented and documented, should not be minimized. What is your initial response when people ask you, what now?</p> \n\n<p>KM: So I think a couple of things. One is there is a cautious optimism amongst some of my progressive friends who think that Trump really was engaged in a campaign to win and to win at all costs, and he stoked the fires of bigotry and racism in order to win, and they think that he will, as president, be a different person. I can tell you right now that that is not the case when it comes to immigration.</p> \n\n<p>If you look at his hundred-day plan, he intends in a very short amount of time to defund sanctuary cities; to repeal the relief that was extended to young people, so that they will be subject to deportation; he wants to build his notorious wall between the US and Mexico; and, finally, he intends to deport what he calls &#8220;undocumented immigrants with criminal histories,&#8221; though &#8220;criminal histories&#8221; are as yet undefined, but that is a very significant number of people. So the &#8220;what now&#8221; for us is to mount a formidable defense, and to do everything we can to stop him at the local, state and national level.</p> \n\n<p>JJ: Well, let me draw you out on one point. Because I have seen already some stories with a kind of tone of relief: Oh, if he&#8217;s just going to deport the criminals&#8230;. You know, we see this also with welfare policy, people looking&#8212;liberals, you know&#8212;for policy that would punish bad poor people but help good poor people. There&#8217;s something very dangerous in itself about this attempt at division, and then the push to legitimize a crime-focused approach to immigration policy in general.</p> \n\n<p>KM: That&#8217;s right. And I&#8217;ll say a couple of things. One is, they are finding it very difficult to defend their number of 2.5 to 3 million people who they believe to be in this country as undocumented with some kind of criminal history. So we think that A) this number is made up and B) that as they move forward with their deportation machinery, that they&#8217;re really going to go after people with misdemeanors or people, for example, who will get pulled over because of a pretextual broken headlight. And one of what we call the architects of hate, Kris Kobach, has <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/kris-kobach-trump-immigration-231430\" type=\"external\">already said</a> that in a situation like that, they don&#8217;t plan to adjudicate the case. So if you get pulled over with a broken headlight or some minor infraction, their intention, once they find out you&#8217;re undocumented, is to deport you.</p> \n\n<p>But it is this dangerous narrative that they&#8217;re moving forward to facilitate the deportation of millions, because if we demonize immigrants and we call them criminals, then I think they&#8217;re betting on Americans feeling this great sense of ease that, well, look at that, we&#8217;re getting rid of the, quote unquote, &#8220;bad immigrant.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>And it creates, also, this dynamic amongst the immigrant community that is very uncomfortable for many, where the good immigrant gets saved and the bad immigrant gets targeted for actual deportation. And that&#8217;s a narrative that people feel very uncomfortable with, given the fact that they are playing fast and loose with what their definition of a &#8220;criminal&#8221; undocumented immigrant is.</p> \n\n<p>JJ: And it almost goes without saying &#8212; and that&#8217;s why, I guess, you have to say it &#8212; the conversation and the coverage of immigration is very racially coded. You know, we aren&#8217;t talking about immigrants from Belgium, for example.</p> \n\n<p>KM: Uh-huh. When Trump talks about undocumented immigrants, he&#8217;s talking about Latinos, and he targets in particular Mexicans, right? To him, Mexicans are the epitome of the vile immigrant. They&#8217;re brown and they are repulsive to him, and so he had no problem calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals that he had no problem demonizing. It is very clear to us that race is at the bottom of his immigration policy, because when he or his peers talk about the undocumented, they don&#8217;t refer, for example, to his wife, who at one point in time was undocumented in the United States. They don&#8217;t refer to the undocumented who are from Ireland or Eastern Europe or any other European country. When they refer to undocumented immigrants, and they demonize these undocumented immigrants, they are talking about brown and black people.</p> \n\n<p>JJ: Well, I see limits even in possibly sympathetic coverage. For example, I&#8217;m seeing praise heaped on the Los Angeles Police Department for saying that they aren&#8217;t going to work with federal law enforcement to enforce immigration policy, that they won&#8217;t randomly ask brown people to show their papers. And while I think that&#8217;s good, it seems like kind of a low bar.</p> \n\n<p>KM: The reality is when the immigration authorities decide to move forward with deportation under Trump, the low-hanging fruit, as you say, are going to be brown people&#8212;brown people like me, I&#8217;m a Latino&#8212;and I think there&#8217;s going to be a lot of racism that&#8217;s going to advance the enforcement machinery: pretextual stops, stop and frisk, racial profiling. The Trump administration is already saying that they&#8217;re going to go after undocumented immigrants and anybody who surrounds them. So if they&#8217;re looking for John Smith, and you happen to be next to John Smith and you are brown, they will come after you as well if you can&#8217;t show your papers. So this to us is a very intentional effort to malign and demonize people of color in this country.</p> \n\n<p>And so it behooves sanctuary cities, and cities who care about their communities, to do everything they can to protect them. Because these policies will not just affect those targeted, it will affect entire communities. I think it will come as no surprise that we live mostly&#8212;except for, you know, gerrymandered districts&#8212;in multi-racial communities. And those of us who do live in multi-racial communities will wake up one day and see our next-door neighbors taken away.</p> \n\n<p>We&#8217;ll go to our church and wonder what happened to that family, and we will learn that that family was deported. We will see acts of terror in public spaces, in houses, in places where people work. And so I think it behooves all of us to wrap our arms around our communities, and it behooves city officials and state officials to mount a control wall &#8212; talking about walls &#8212; good strong walls to protect their residents from the terror that Trump and his administration intends to unleash in a few months.</p> \n\n<p>JJ: Are sanctuary cities &#8212; I&#8217;ve been very interested to hear cities proclaiming themselves, or underscoring that they are, sanctuary cities. Does that have a legal underpinning, or is that a statement of an intention and policy? How tough is that?</p> \n\n<p>KM: Yeah, so, the understood definition of sanctuary city is any city that refuses to carry out the law enforcement job of immigration and customs enforcement. There were efforts under Obama with 287(g) and Secure Communities to encourage local law enforcement to carry out the mandate of immigration and customs enforcement, to advance deportation. Many cities resisted. When people talk about sanctuary cities, a lot of the time they&#8217;re really referring to the refusal of local communities to carry out deportation policies for the federal government.</p> \n\n<p>But more broadly, sanctuary cities are understood as places that protect the undocumented immigrant and provide a haven for them and provide the opportunity for immigrants, irrespective of their status, to be welcomed, to be productive citizens in their respective communities, and to engage in the civic life of the cities.</p> \n\n<p>So if you look at some of the anti-immigrant organizations, Center for Immigrant Studies has a broader definition of sanctuary city, where they define sanctuary cities as any city that is friendly towards immigrants. So where I live, for example, New Haven, Connecticut, it&#8217;s considered a sanctuary city under their definition, because the city implemented a program to offer city identification cards to any resident of the city, irrespective of their status. So if you go by that broader definition, there are hundreds of sanctuary cities in the United States, and many of them are already engaged in acts of defiance, publicly letting the federal government know that they will do absolutely everything they can to protect immigrants in their communities.</p> \n\n<p>JJ: Let me just ask you, finally, is there anything that you think reporters could be doing more of or less of in these difficult times, particularly with regard to coverage of, not just the White House moves on immigration, but on the status of immigrant communities generally?</p> \n\n<p>KM: I have seen the damage that happens in communities when aggressive deportation policies are carried out. And let me just be really clear about something: They traumatize families, they traumatize communities, and they rip apart the fabric of whatever community, whatever city these deportations are carried out in. I think that journalists should tell those stories. When they hear of deportations, and they hear of raids being carried out in whatever community they&#8217;re in, I would encourage them to cover those stories, interview the families that are impacted, talk to community members.</p> \n\n<p>Because I want to believe, despite the outcome of the election, that most Americans care about justice, that most Americans really want to live up to the ideals of our democracy. And the kind of vision and future that Donald Trump sees for Americans, I want to believe, is not what Americans want at the end of the day. The average length of stay here, the median stay for undocumented immigrants, is 15 years, so we are talking about people who have made their lives in this country.</p> \n\n<p>Many undocumented immigrants live in what is known as mixed status families, so there are many instances of undocumented parents with US citizen kids.

He soon clarified his comment, suggesting that women who get abortions should not be penalized. But most recently, he doubled down on his initial statement.</p> \n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the chronology: During an interview with MSNBC&#8217;s Chris Matthews last Wednesday, Trump said that abortion should be banned and that &#8220; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">there has to be some form of punishment</a>&#8221; for women who obtain abortions once they are outlawed. Faced with immediate <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/30/politics/donald-trump-abortion-town-hall/\" type=\"external\">criticism</a> from both anti-abortion and pro-abortion rights groups, his campaign issued a statement saying that Trump believed that only the abortion provider, not the woman, should be held legally responsible.</p> \n\n<p>But a few days later, on Saturday, Trump essentially reaffirmed his initial comments. His answer to Matthews&#8217; question was &#8220;excellent,&#8221; Trump told talk radio host Joe Pags, in an interview <a href=\"http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/donald-trump-defends-call-punishing-women-who-have-abortions-i-didnt-see-any-big-deal\" type=\"external\">flagged</a> on Tuesday by the liberal website Right Wing Watch. Here&#8217;s the exchange:</p> \n\n<p>TRUMP: A lot of people thought my answer was excellent, by the way. There were a lot of people who thought that was a very good answer. It was a hypothetical question. I didn&#8217;t see any big deal and then all of a sudden there was somewhat of a storm. And you know, it&#8217;s interesting, this morning I&#8217;m hearing two hosts on television that were critical and they said, &#8220;We really thought his first answer was very good.&#8221; Because you can&#8217;t win. &#8220;We thought it was good, what was wrong with his first answer?&#8221; And I heard a pastor, who is a fantastic pastor, saying, &#8220;Well, you know, if you think about it, his first answer was right&#8221;&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>PAGS: Well, your answer was consistent with conservatism but Chris Matthews has an agenda, so I&#8217;m not even wondering about the question because I thought it was loaded and stupid and hypothetical.</p> \n\n<p>TRUMP: It was disgraceful.</p> \n\n<p>PAGS: Why go on the show? Why go?</p> \n\n<p>TRUMP: I heard people defending it today. Now they defend it. Now they say, &#8220;It was really right.&#8221; The whole thing is just so&#8212;look, the press is extremely unfair.</p> \n\n<p>Trump, though, was not done with this subject. The next day, he had yet another position on abortion. He appeared on CBS&#8217;s Face the Nation and stated that the current law on abortion should not be changed. Once again, his campaign had to renovate his message. It quickly <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-dont-change-abortion-laws/\" type=\"external\">walked back</a> this statement, asserting that Trump meant the law will remain the same &#8220;until he is President.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Trump Says His Controversial Comment About Abortion Was \u201cExcellent\u201d", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2016/04/trump-abortion-comment-punish-women-excellent/", "published_at": "2016-04-05", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>With a contested primary on the horizon for the Nevada U.S. Senate race, some big Republican names have thrown their support behind Dean Heller, the vulnerable GOP incumbent.</p> \n\n<p>In a campaign email to Heller supporters, Nevada Lt.

The results are not surprising for those who've been watching what's taken place on college campuses in recent months.</p> \n\n<p>Over the last year, the social justice left on campuses across the country has increasingly used violence and disruption to suppress speech they deem offensive &#8212; messages that do not align with their ideological and political agenda. The situation has been exacerbated by social justice-sympathizing administrations empowering the radical \"activists\" by disempowering law enforcement.</p> \n\n<p>But what is most troubling is that these anti-free speech beliefs and tactics are not simply embraced by a radical fringe. A recent <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Brookings Institute study</a> found that a majority of students believe that disrupting speakers to silence them is \"acceptable\" and one in five students (19%) endorse the use of violence to silence an \"offensive\" speaker. A plurality of students believe that \"hate speech\" is not covered by the First Amendment, despite Supreme Court precedent establishing otherwise.</p> \n\n<p>As a follow-up to the Brookings' study, Campus Reform decided to hit the campus greens to talk in person with some students to see if they really do endorse violence and those leading the violence, Antifa. All of the students the video features say they have a generally \"positive\" view of Antifa, and most of them say they believe violence against \"fascists\" is justified and can be a useful \"tool\" for pushing back against \"hate.\"</p> \n\n<p>\"I like them,\" one student says of Antifa. \"Beating up fascists is good.\"</p> \n\n<p>One student says that her impression of Antifa is good because she only sees them marching next to her and \"standing for what I believe in.\" Another says she sees them \"more on the positive side because they're combating hate.\"</p> \n\n<p>\"I think that a lot of them are trying to educate,\" says one student.</p> \n\n<p>\"A lot of people say that they're creating more hate,\" says a female student, \"but I think if you're combating hate then it automatically makes you more on the positive side.\"</p> \n\n<p>When one male is asked directly if violence is sometimes justified, he replies, \"Absolutely.

The company will report its results for the quarter on Thursday, Oct. 26, after market close.</p> \n\n<p>Ahead of Alphabet's third-quarter report, here's an early look at three areas investors may want to check in on after the update: revenue growth, Alphabet's \"Google other\" segment, and its \"other bets\" segment.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>For Alphabet's third quarter, analysts' consensus estimate&amp;#160;for revenue is $27.2 billion. This compares to revenue of $22.5 billion in the year-ago quarter, representing about a 21% increase.</p> \n\n<p>The analysts' consensus estimate seems well founded, given that Alphabet's revenue in its second quarter was similarly up 21% year over year.</p> \n\n<p>Alphabet's strong revenue growth recently continues to demonstrate the search giant's ability to consistently grow its business at heady rates. In its second quarter, management said its&amp;#160;solid top line was <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/07/25/alphabet-inc-earnings-5-metrics-you-shouldnt-overl.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=72b890f2-a54a-11e7-b600-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">primarily driven Opens a New Window.</a> by strong Google advertising revenue growth in mobile search and on YouTube. Alphabet's Google advertising revenue accounts for 87%&amp;#160;of Alphabet's total revenue. The segment revenue was up 18% year over year.</p> \n\n<p>Investors should look for strong advertising growth to similarly help drive Alphabet's top line in Q3.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Made up primarily of revenue from the Android app store, Google-branded hardware, and cloud services, Alphabet's \"Google other\" segment is becoming increasingly important to the company's results. In Alphabet's second quarter, other revenue was up 42% year over year. Further, other revenue accounted for a notable 12% of second-quarter revenue, up from 10% in the year-ago quarter.</p> \n\n<p>Can Alphabet's Google other segment keep up this strong growth in Q3?</p> \n\n<p>Not to be consumed with Google other revenue, which falls under the company's Google reporting segment, Alphabet's \"other bets\" segment represents a much smaller portion of the company. It's where Alphabet files its \"moonshot\" projects like Nest, Verily, Fiber, and its self-driving car company <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2016/12/14/alphabet-incs-self-driving-car-project-becomes-a-c.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=72b890f2-a54a-11e7-b600-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Waymo Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>In Alphabet's second quarter, other-bets revenue represented only a fraction of the company's total top line -- at less than 1%. The segment is growing rapidly. Second-quarter other-bets revenue climbed 34% year over year.</p> \n\n<p>But it's not the growth of Alphabet's other bets segment that investors should be keeping an eye on. Rather, investors should be watching how quickly Alphabet can reduce the segment's massive operating losses. In Alphabet's second quarter, other bets' operating loss was $772 million, weighing meaningfully on overall profitability.</p> \n\n<p>Fortunately, Alphabet has made progress recently on improving its other bets operating losses. In Alphabet's second quarter, other bets $772 million operating loss was narrower than the segment's $855 million operating loss in the year-ago quarter. Further, Alphabet's other bets operating losses are improving rapidly on a sequential basis lately, narrowing from $1.088 billion&amp;#160;in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $855 million in the first quarter of 2017.</p> \n\n<p>Investors should look for Alphabet's other bets operating loss to continue to improve on both a year-over-year and sequential basis in Q3.</p> \n\n<p>Overall, investors should look for Alphabet's results to continue highlighting the strength of its search business while also showing promising signs in its smaller segments.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than AlphabetWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Halloween is just around the corner, followed by Thanksgiving, and then &#8211; before we know it &#8211; Christmas and New Year. This year, we have to add in Election Day as another special event because it is guaranteed to cause plenty of distractions. We wish these wonderful fall days were more than just a brief lull in the annual holiday rush.</p> \n\n<p>If we don&#8217;t get busy soon, it will be Jan. 2, 2017, and the holidays will be in the history books without us making any contributions to the joyful season. Because, believe it or not, preparing for the holidays is almost a season unto itself. There are no flashing lights or holiday songs to pay tribute to the planning and preparations, but it is a real &#8220;season.&#8221; And it takes a lot of real work to get through it.</p> \n\n<p>So, we&#8217;re already behind and we have to get going if we want to stay on top of things. It&#8217;s time to make our lists, check them twice and get organized. And for the people who decorate for Halloween or celebrate it in a big way, the time is right on top of you.</p> \n\n<p>Every year, we promise to be more organized. It&#8217;s not like the holidays are a surprise. They tend to occur every year at about the same time, so why aren&#8217;t we prepared, why aren&#8217;t we always prepared? Who knows &#8211; maybe we just enjoy the hustle and bustle of rushing around trying to get everything ready on time.</p> \n\n<p>We have a plan, however. This year, although we&#8217;re late starting, we&#8217;re going to be organized enough that we get everything done without letting it get too stressful. We&#8217;re going to remember to be truly thankful during Thanksgiving, even if our meal or our decorations aren&#8217;t perfect. We&#8217;re aiming for a Christmas season during which we honor the religious significance, while having fun and enjoying the rest of the season.</p> \n\n<p>Maybe we won&#8217;t have a holiday worthy of a photo spread in some fancy magazine, but we&#8217;re going to aim for one filled with love and laughter, good food and good cheer &#8211; and, of course, family and friends. We vow to help those in need have a special holiday because those gifts are often more valuable than buying things for people who already have everything.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>We have decided that the holidays and our enjoyment of them will not be overtaken by Things To Do lists. The season itself is much more important than marking one more thing off &#8220;the list.&#8221; We will be in charge, not the lists.</p> \n\n<p>Or maybe, this year, we&#8217;ll just relax, have a margarita and consider whether we want red or green on our burrito.

(Washington Blade file photo by Michael Key)</p> \n\n<p>The White House on Thursday released an updated version of its National HIV/AIDS Strategy that includes a comprehensive plan for reducing the number of new HIV infections between 2015 and 2020 by at least 25 percent.</p> \n\n<p>The 74-page strategy document, which updates the Obama administration&#8217;s AIDS strategy plan first adopted in 2010, also calls for significantly reducing the rate of new HIV infections among gay and bisexual men, young black gay and bisexual men, black women and &#8220;persons living in the Southern United States.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In addition, the document calls for focusing more resources on curtailing the HIV infection rate for transgender women, &#8220;particularly the high burden of HIV among black transgender women.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The overall number of new HIV infections in the U.S. has remained at about 50,000 new cases each year for the past decade despite ongoing HIV education and prevention programs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p> \n\n<p>The White House announced on Thursday that President Obama officially launched the updated National HIV/AIDS Strategy through an executive order.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;This order is designed to ensure successful implementation of the Updated Strategy by requiring coordination and collaboration by, and accountability of, the Federal Government; fostering enhanced and innovative partnerships with state, tribal, and local governments; and encouraging the commitment of all parts of society,&#8221; Obama states in the order.</p> \n\n<p>A statement and fact sheet released by the White House says the updated strategy retains the four main goals set in the 2010 strategy document: reducing new HIV infections; increasing access to care and improving health outcomes for people living with HIV; reducing HIV-related disparities and health inequities; and achieving a more coordinated national response to the AIDS epidemic.</p> \n\n<p>The updated strategy calls for focusing on four &#8220;priority activities&#8221;:</p> \n\n<p>&#8226; Widespread HIV testing and ensuring that those who test positive are given full access to care and treatment.</p> \n\n<p>&#8226; Broad support for people living with HIV to ensure that they remain engaged in comprehensive care and they adhere to their treatment regimen.</p> \n\n<p>&#8226; Universal viral suppression among people with HIV, which means lowering the level of the HIV virus through effective drug treatment so that the virus is undetectable and the chances that the person can infect someone else with HIV are greatly reduced.</p> \n\n<p>&#8226; Full access to comprehensive pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, services &#8220;for those whom it is appropriate and desired.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;As one of the tools in the HIV prevention toolkit, PrEP is a way for people who don&#8217;t have HIV to prevent HIV infection by taking a pill every day,&#8221; the White House fact sheet says.</p> \n\n<p>The fact sheet and the updated strategy document don&#8217;t mention that the PrEP program has been criticized by some AIDS activists as a poor approach for HIV prevention because it could prompt people at risk for HIV to discontinue safe-sex practices, such as condom use, and lead to HIV infection if those on the prophylaxis drug fail to take it every day.</p> \n\n<p>Supporters of the PrEP program, including officials with the National Institutes of Health and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, point to studies showing that PrEP has been effective in preventing HIV infection among those who adhere to taking the required daily pill.</p> \n\n<p>Several national AIDS advocacy groups released statements expressing support for the updated strategy document, saying it builds on the 2010 document&#8217;s goals for greatly curtailing the AIDS epidemic in the U.S.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Since the first National HIV/AIDS Strategy was released in 2010, major advances have transformed how we respond to HIV, provided new tools to prevent new infections, and improved access to care,&#8221; a statement released by the New York based Gay Men&#8217;s Health Crisis says. &#8220;This updated strategy seeks to scale what is working, looking ahead to 2020 with a clear road map to help end the epidemic, once and for all,&#8221; the statement says.</p> \n\n<p>Don Blanchon, executive director of D.C.&#8217;s Whitman-Walker Health, called the updated strategy &#8220;a more detailed roadmap to guide our ongoing journey to end HIV.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute, a national AIDS advocacy group, called the updated document an &#8220;exceptional national strategy to address HIV in the U.S.,&#8221; but cautioned that the strategy could be undermined by proposed congressional budget cuts in various AIDS programs, including parts of the Ryan White AIDS CARE Act programs.</p> \n\n<p>Michael Weinstein, president of AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the nation&#8217;s largest AIDS services and advocacy organization, praised the updated strategy for its focus on greater efforts to curtail HIV infections in the South, where he said the epidemic has been &#8220;exploding&#8221; during the past decade.</p> \n\n<p>But Weinstein, a vocal critic of the PrEP program, said in a statement that the White House strategy should focus more on its call for universal treatment of people who are HIV positive than on &#8220;an overreliance on PrEP.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He pointed to studies, which are also cited in the updated HIV/AIDS Strategy document, showing that people with HIV who are successfully treated with anti-retroviral drugs are 96 percent less likely to infect someone else with HIV than those who are not being treated with effective AIDS drugs.</p> \n\n<p>The strategy document notes that as of 2012, the latest year in which figures were available, only 30 percent of all people living with HIV in the U.S. achieved full viral suppression.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The HIV epidemic in the United States is concentrated in key populations and geographic areas and the Update guides our response to prioritize the following groups,&#8221; the White House statement accompanying the new strategy document says.</p> \n\n<p>&#8226; Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men of all races and ethnicities, &#8220;noting the particularly high burden of HIV among black gay and bisexual men.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8226; Black women and men</p> \n\n<p>&#8226; Latinos and Latinas</p> \n\n<p>&#8226; People who inject drugs</p> \n\n<p>&#8226; Youth aged 13 to 24 years, &#8220;noting the particularly high burden of HIV among young black gay and bisexual men&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8226; People living in the South</p> \n\n<p>&#8226; Transgender women, &#8220;noting the particularly high burden of HIV among black transgender women.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The updated National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the United States can be accessed <a href=\"\" type=\"external\">here</a>.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">AIDS</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">AIDS Institute</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Barack Obama</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">bisexual</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Carl Schmid</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">CDC</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Don Blanchon</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">gay</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Gay Men's Health Crisis</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">HIV</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">HIV/AIDS</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">MSM</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">National HIV/AIDS Strategy</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">PrEP</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Ryan White</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">transgender</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">White House</a> <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Whitman-Walker Health</a></p>", "title": "White House updates National HIV/AIDS Strategy", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "http://washingtonblade.com/2015/07/31/white-house-updates-national-hivaids-strategy/", "published_at": "", "bias": 3}, {"text": "<p>A 17-year-old undocumented migrant is being prevented from accessing abortion care, and remains in custody in Texas.</p> \n\n<p>After escaping an abusive home in Central America where her sister was beaten by her parents for being pregnant, \"Jane Doe\" is facing a different kind of punishment in the country where she sought refuge.</p> \n\n<p>On Wednesday, a federal judge ruled to allow the pregnant teen access to an abortion.

But it lasted only a couple of minutes before the Lobos moved to special teams.</p> \n\n<p>&#8230; Good afternoon from University Stadium, where the New Mexico Lobos (4-7 overall, 1-5 in Mountain West Conference play) and the Nevada Wolf Pack (6-4, 3-3) will tee it up in about half an hour.

Hinduism. We may pussyfoot around it and refer to it as Hindutva, saffronisation or, what the ruling rightwing Bhartiya Janata Party calls &#8220;fringe elements&#8221;, but the discourse is clearly embedded in the faith of the majority community.</p> \n\n<p>Slurs against Muslims have become commonplace. A country that wants to declare the cow as the mother of the nation and where minorities have to prove their patriotism not by allegiance to the flag but to the political party in power is bound to descend into chaos.</p> \n\n<p>Two years ago, a mob brandishing hockey sticks and knives barged into Mohammed Akhlaq&#8217;s house in Dadri in north India and assaulted all the family members before killing him because they suspected there was beef in their fridge. The meat was sent to the forensic lab and it was found to be lamb.</p> \n\n<p>When one of his killers <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">died</a> (of natural causes), he was given a martyr&#8217;s funeral; his coffin was draped in the national flag and there were speeches by leaders from Hindu organisations that have direct access to the government.</p> \n\n<p>Last month towards the end of Ramadan when Junaid boarded the train to return home with his Eid shopping bags, he might not have imagined that the elderly man whom he offered the seat to would egg on a mob punching him and his friends. Abuses flew. &#8220;Beef eater&#8221;, &#8220;antinational&#8221;, &#8220;mullah&#8221;. They pulled at their skull caps and newly-sprouted beards. Knives came out telling them to go to Pakistan. They were bleeding. Nobody came to their rescue. Junaid was stabbed. He died. He was 16. At the stations en route some of the lynch mob got off, enough to let the cops shrug about little evidence.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">A scuffle</a> for seats got transformed into a fight for political and religious space. Or, perhaps, religious assertiveness is seeking out reasons.</p> \n\n<p>Meat trader Alimuddin Ansari was beaten up by a mob and his van, ostensibly with cattle meat, was set on fire in Jharkhand. There seemed to have been a dispute with some people who were extorting money from him. Such excuses have become the norm where the victim is invariably Muslim, for it was not a spontaneous act. His movements were tracked for hours before he was murdered.</p> \n\n<p>Mohammad Majloom and Inayatullah Khan of Latehar were taking their cattle to a fair many miles away. Five men with a mission waylaid them. After they killed the 35 and 13 year old, they tied a noose around their necks and hung them from a tree.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Prima facie it appears to have been a case of a gang attempting to loot cattle,&#8221; the cops said. For those in a hurry to rob and make a quick escape with the cattle to profit from it, they seemed to have relished in committing the murders. Not only did they kill the two, they hanged them. The hanging was a message. To shame. To hold them up as an example. How dare they not respect their gau mata, the cow mother, their religion?</p> \n\n<p>It is disconcerting that mobs are using cow protection as the higher cause even to settle petty disputes. The shaming has got a further boost because the videos are uploaded and shared. The message gets more traction. What is so evident in these viral videos is that the so-called &#8216;jihadi mentality&#8217; that Muslims are accused of does not respond in kind. The victims are just&amp;#160;overwhelmed by the suddenness of the attack; in some instances they are&amp;#160;pleading, in one the man does not even have the energy or presence of&amp;#160;mind to protest as they grab his hair and kick him. He just takes it like a&amp;#160;stoic who has become accustomed to lie on a bed of nails.</p> \n\n<p>***</p> \n\n<p>Narendra Modi, the prime minister of India, has not uttered a word condoling any of these deaths. He tweets mourning for the loss of lives in a fire in Portugal, but makes no attempt to reach out to the families of those killed by men purportedly supporting his party&#8217;s Hindutva dream, a dream to reclaim ancient India and transform the country into a Hindu nation.</p> \n\n<p>When he does <a href=\"https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/strict-action-will-be-taken-against-cow-vigilante-groups-says-pm-modi/299582\" type=\"external\">speak</a>, it is evasive: &#8220;All (state) governments should take stringent action against those who are violating law in the name of cow protection.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>How will this happen when some state governments are handing out expensive beef detection kits to the cops to smell for trouble, effectively converting the police force into cow protectors too? The very fact that there are several cow protection groups is worrying, for they aren&#8217;t animal rights activists but soldiers of the faith.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Bolo Jai Shri Ram&#8221; (Hail Lord Rama), is the war cry. People are stopped in the streets and asked to owe allegiance to their god. A mentally unstable woman was slapped and forced to utter the words; a cleric was pummelled just outside the mosque by a group insisting he chant the phrase; <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/was-forced-to-say-jai-sri-ram-by-bajrang-dal-activists-claims-ndtv-journalist-4731743/\" type=\"external\">journalist Munne Bharti</a> was driving with his elderly parents. Suddenly, their car was surrounded by a group. They threatened to set the car on fire if they did not chant &#8220;Jai Shri Ram&#8221;. They did. An adult was frightened, for himself and his aged parents.</p> \n\n<p>***</p> \n\n<p>How is this not about religion, then?</p> \n\n<p>It was always about religion, perhaps by a few skewed minds.&amp;#160;25 years ago Bal Thackeray, the leader of the militant Shiv Sena, had asked for the disenfranchisement of Muslims. He would address huge rallies at an open ground referring to Muslims as &#8220;katuas&#8221;, the cut ones without a foreskin. After the Babri Masjid was demolished in Ayodhya, on the instructions of these political parties, and the riots reached what was then Bombay, the men in the streets would point at the crotches of Muslim men and snigger, &#8220;katua&#8221;. They were stopped and asked to strip for a random check by random people. Unlike the Sikhs after the riots in 1984 who discarded their turbans and shaved off their hair to protect themselves, Muslims could not get back their foreskin.</p> \n\n<p>At the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">All-India Hindu Convention</a>&amp;#160;held last month in Goa, for 4 days all the cars at the venue were sprayed with cow urine to purify them. &#8220;Their car needs shuddhi karan. We do it to all objects &#8212; watches, clothes, sometimes even handbags. It&#8217;s a spiritual exercise.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>How people choose to practise their faith is a personal matter. But when you have a cow piss soda, cow dung and urine being made a part of ayurvedic medicines and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">astrologers treating people</a> in hospital OPDs, then it becomes obvious that the cow and beef are incidental here. They are only the more potent batons to beat the minorities. There is also the commercial angle. Giving a charlatan guru called Ramdev land and business rights to run an empire ostensibly selling indigenous products is a strategy to bring the devil close to your home.</p> \n\n<p>Young Hindu women are <a href=\"http://zeenews.india.com/news/uttar-pradesh/love-jihadis-beware-hindu-girls-being-prepared-to-fight-forced-religious-conversion-in-aligarh_1896121.html\" type=\"external\">training in self-defence</a> to protect them from &#8220;love jihad&#8221;, a bogey created by the rightwing suggesting that Muslim men are luring them to fall in love to later convert them.</p> \n\n<p>In May last year, there was a report about a <a href=\"http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/bajrang-dal-imparts-military-training-to-cadre-to-fight-terror/1/675774.html\" type=\"external\">camp</a> in Uttar Pradesh training the youth wing of militant Hindu organisations to protect the country from terrorists. In the video images they are aiming their air guns and sticks at men wearing skull caps. The governor had justified the drill: &#8220;Those who cannot defend themselves, cannot ultimately defend the country and there is nothing wrong if some youths are getting arms-training purely for self defence.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>That instead of urging these fit youth to join the army, they are being brainwashed to target a particular group makes the intention clear. How is this not about religion?</p> \n\n<p>***</p> \n\n<p>The fallout of such brainwashing is not restricted to the extremist Hindutva proponents alone. There is a not-so-subtle attempt to deflect from the Hinduness of the terror by liberals too. An academic who has taken it upon himself to explain India to Indians on social media from his perch in the US has <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">written</a> about the global Muslim victimhood industry by playing victim: &#8220;One cannot use the term &#8216;Muslim terror&#8217; (but Hindu or Christian or Left terror is fine) or even Islamic terror without worry of being termed communal, bigoted, or Islamophobic. The appropriate phrase is &#8216;Islamist terror,&#8217; which, we are expected to clarify, has nothing to do with Islam.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Some commentators have begun to call India Lynchistan, the land of lynching. We do not seem to realise that mobs thrive on notoriety. They are not seeking a popular mandate, because they already are the popular mandate. Paper tiger responses only embolden their cause. The truth is that nobody in mainstream media or in activism or with an outsider&#8217;s perspective, like <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Dr. Amartya Sen</a>, has had the courage or the will to call these planned lynchings as Hindu terrorism.</p> \n\n<p>Is such nomenclature important? It is. Because it is a systematic attempt to annihilate the minorities, specifically Muslims. (Quite different from Islamist terrorism whose victims are mainly Muslim and, in some cases like the ISIS&#8217;s victims, also people who are liberal enough to support Muslims.)</p> \n\n<p>Muslims immediately distance themselves from any jihad violence, even though that does not assuage their neighbours from seeing them as potential suspects. Hindus are not doing so in large enough numbers, and they are chary of admitting the faith angle because they believe that Hinduism is not a monotheistic faith with allegiance to one book and one god. It is amorphous and therefore fluid, they reason.</p> \n\n<p>The caste system and its treatment of Dalits and the backward castes certainly reveals &#8216;fluidity&#8217;. All the government-engineered riots have been masterminded by a vile intellect that outsources the war to the police and army and pumps up the trading class to decimate minority businesses. The murder of minorities is only a more violent assertion of this sheltered ghettoisation of the elite majority.</p> \n\n<p>There are many who use their internet liberalism to rationalise their own subtle bigotry. That many of them also have a stake in steak does lend weight to their public &#8220;I&#8217;m not too Hindu&#8221; utterances.</p> \n\n<p>In one such recent piece, the headline <a href=\"http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/bloody-mary/is-the-hindu-a-victim-no-hindus-feel-safe-and-the-victim-narrative-is-a-manufactured-war-cry/\" type=\"external\">flashed</a> about how Hindu victimhood is a manufactured cry. In the first para itself, though, the writer gave a clean chit to Muslims quoting, of all people, George Bush: &#8220;India is a country which does not have a single al-Qaida member in a population of 150 million Muslims.&#8221; Hindus do not have to prove whether they have allegiance to any extremist organisation, even if they elect them to power.</p> \n\n<p>The usage of Islamist phrases like fatwa and jihad to explain Hindu terror acts and suggest they are only &#8220;mimicking&#8221; reeks of another version of Islamophobia and projects violence by Hindu extremists as a reaction to centuries of abuse by Muslim rulers. This historic narrative pushes the &#8216;tolerate Muslims despite their past&#8217; idea, the moral compass revealing who considers itself the superior side.</p> \n\n<p>These recent attempts to call out Hindu extremists is not organic. They are a response to some of us wondering why we did not link the Hindu word with terrorism. We have woken up or, in good old Hindu speak, and in deference to many of us being converts from the ancient religion, our third eye has been awakened.</p>", "title": "The Murder of Muslims", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://counterpunch.org/2017/07/21/the-murder-of-muslims/", "published_at": "2017-07-21", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Hello,</p> \n\n<p>My name is Cynthia. I recently graduated with my master's degree and have secured a full-time job in East Palo Alto with a nonprofit working with young people. I have steady income, good references, a 759 credit score and good renter history. I am responsible.</p> \n\n<p>I try to live as healthy as possible. So, I spend a lot of time outside. I don't own a TV. I like to write. I am looking for a long-term space for my daughter and myself. She is 6 years old.</p> \n\n<p>We are looking for a calm space that we can call home. At the moment, we are homeless. It is hard to find someone who is willing to offer us a space. We have a regular early rise type of sleeping schedule. We are very clean individuals and find that organization makes our life easier.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>We try to be as positive as possible and believe in communication first, as long as people are willing. If not, we keep to ourselves.</p> \n\n<p>My daughter will be gone most weekends with her father. Otherwise, she is always by my side. She is well behaved. We have family in Redwood City. So, we spend most of our time there.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Thank you for your time,</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>CLC</p> \n\n<p>This is the introduction that I have been sending out like a robot on a daily basis, in the desperate hope of finding a place to live. I never expected it to be so difficult to find housing in California's Bay Area, especially on the Peninsula, my place of birth and where I grew up.</p> \n\n<p>Throughout the years, I have witnessed the drastic changes that my hometown, Redwood City, has gone through, and I don't know if any of those changes have benefited the individuals in my community, including myself. Since I was 12 years old, I have been engaged within my community by participating in programs and organizations that are rooted in social justice.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The people living in low-income communities of color that are being gentrified deserve to live in the space that we call home, not because we are a needed component of a hierarchy system but because we are human.?</p> \n\n<p>Cynthia Cruz, a Silicon Valley resident</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>I have volunteered and served as a model for young people, who are struggling with the same circumstances that I experienced while growing up as a first-generation, low-income, fatherless, little Brown girl.</p> \n\n<p>Last May, I walked across the stage at San Jose State University and received my third college degree, after navigating the unpaved road of higher education. As the American Dream dictates, I have worked incessantly, bootstraps have permanently scarred my hands. I pull and sustain.</p> \n\n<p>My community has failed me when I have worked to be a productive member of society, but I cannot find a safe space for my family to live. During my search for housing, I have felt completely degraded as a human being. Looking for housing on the Peninsula has turned into a human rights violation.</p> \n\n<p>During my search, I have experienced circumstances that are fundamentally degrading and have made me make sacrifices. I dedicate an average of two hours a day sending out emails, making calls and driving to see spaces. Recently, after taking the time to drive to a potential home, investigating the space and filling out a three-page application, I was told, not to bother applying by a White man.</p> \n\n<p>He did not even make eye contact with me.&amp;#160;He stated that there had already been more than 10 applicants for a $1,500 per month studio without parking or washer and dryer amenities.</p> \n\n<p>At open houses, standing with my daughter in hand, I quickly understood that I could not compete with all of the high-tech, single \"professionals.\" They are always the preferred candidate. With my daughter next to me, I am asked personal questions about my romantic life, my child custody agreement, details about my daily routine - questions that I must answer even with extreme discomfort if I wish to be considered.</p> \n\n<p>My discomfort escalated and morphed into something aberrant on the occasion that I was recorded without my consent. At the end of a conversation with a landlord, she simply tapped her phone, which had been on the table and said, \"I hope we were loud enough. It is so I won't forget anything when I talk to my husband.\"</p> \n\n<p>I concluded that our entire conversation had been recorded. I was never told that our conversation would be recorded. She never asked for consent. I swallowed all of the immediate alarms going off in my head and the dark feeling creeping out of my chest. I simply smiled and said I would wait for her decision about the mini studio.</p> \n\n<p>Two days later, the landlord contacted me to let me know she was willing to rent to me but was asking for $1,650, instead of $1,500 which was the original listing price. I cannot afford to pay $1,650 per month for a mini studio. It is not sustainable for myself and my daughter. My conscience awakens with all of the wrath brought to an ocean by a hurricane, but is abruptly stunted by the desire to be able to tell my daughter that we have a home.</p> \n\n<p>These two incidents reflect my entire experience of trying to search for a home on the Peninsula for my daughter and myself. As an individual working with the public in communities that are violently being displaced, I battle with the monster that is gentrification. Its claws have uprooted open spaces, filled them with concrete and one-way mirrors.</p> \n\n<p>Its teeth have chewed away at all of the affordable housing, leaving it smeared with the shiny saliva of luxury condominiums. It is an uphill battle, when what nourishes this monster is capitalistic greed. We are also consumed, when the mainstream arguments against gentrification revolve around the very same ideas that keeps this monster alive.</p> \n\n<p>\"If all of the low-income people move away who will work in the service jobs?\"</p> \n\n<p>\"Who will keep the Peninsula functioning if there are no blue collar workers?\"</p> \n\n<p>This discourse is located within the framework that creates a situation in which people are literally pushed out of their homes and communities. Gentrification is more than the appropriation of environment - it is about stripping an entire community of a way of life, tradition, history and sustainability.</p> \n\n<p>Gentrification is a symptom of social inequality, which makes social justice the only argument against displacement.</p> \n\n<p>The people living in low-income communities of color that are being gentrified deserve to live in the space that we call home, not because we are a needed component of a hierarchy system but because we are human.</p> \n\n<p>There is a problem when attempting to secure basic survival, comes with the loss of self respect and scrapes down my throat as I swallow in order to provide for my daughter.</p> \n\n<p>I do not strive for luxury served on a silver spoon. I would simply like the basic needs that society assured I would be able to secure if I walked down the directed path. I realize the American Dream will never manifest for me when I open my eyes.</p> \n\n<p>I must imagine my own - a type of dream that is not dehumanizing when I attempt to make it a reality and one that is inclusive of individuals like myself and my daughter.</p> \n\n<p>A version of this essay first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.siliconvalleydebug.org/\" type=\"external\">Silicon Valley De-Bug</a>, a community organizing, advocacy and media <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">organization</a> in San Jose, Calif.

Three years later, World News Tonight has closed this viewer deficit gap and is currently leading the season for the first time in 21 years since Peter Jennings was anchor. ...</p> \n\n<p>According to research available at the time of publishing, had Nightly News&#8216; ratings average been based on the full five days of last week &#8212; as was ABC&#8217;s &#8212; and did not retitle Friday&#8217;s program &#8212; then World News Tonight would have won the week by roughly 37,000 viewers head-to-head. But the shrewd manner by which NBC retitled Friday&#8217;s show dropped their lowest-rated day of the average which pulled NBC&#8217;s program ahead of ABC&#8217;s by 264,000. Oddly, had ABC also retitled their Friday show (dropping the least viewed day out of their weekly average) NBC would have also won the week. Got it? ...</p> \n\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time NBC has displayed aggressive tactics. In 2015 they secretly aired Nightly News overnight in several markets to increase viewership and count two viewership numbers in these cities instead of one.

Today we&#8217;re going to run the gamut from farmworkers to teachers to millionaire athletes, and later we&#8217;ll be speaking with Dolores Huerta and many, many other guests. But first, Philip Dray.</p> \n\n<p>* * *Josh Scheer:</p> \n\n<p>Well, we&#8217;re sitting here with Philip Dray, and we&#8217;re here with Robert Scheer, and I&#8217;m Joshua Scheer. We&#8217;re discussing Philip&#8217;s book, &#8220;There is Power in a Union.&#8221; Why do you think people overlook labor history?</p> \n\n<p>Philip Dray: Good question! You know, I think it&#8217;s because the labor movement, over the past half-century, went into kind of a decline. It began losing numbers; unionized jobs disappeared, because of new technology; you had large industrial centers like Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Detroit, sort of dwindle in size; you had charges of corruption against unions, which tended to stick in people&#8217;s minds. And then, of course, you had globalization in the last 15, 20 years, which reduces the leverage that unionized workers have, and so tends to reduce the power of unions generally. And I think they&#8217;ve been cast sort of unfairly as organizations that bargain for generous pensions, and that kind of thing, and then wind up messing up cities&#8217; fiscal situations, or what have you. But you know, I think there&#8217;s been a lot of negative public relations about unions, from various sources; I don&#8217;t think that much of it is really deserved.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: This is Robert Scheer cutting in. Let me just say, what your book captures is the vibrant, robust contribution of trade unions to American democracy. And what has really happened is that the political system, through the work of lobbyists, has been turned against unions. So you can go back to Taft-Hartley and that whole battle, but globalization, all these things didn&#8217;t happen by accident. In your book you talk about Ronald Reagan&#8217;s role, the air traffic controllers issue going back to 1981. So the destruction of unions was not a natural phenomenon.</p> \n\n<p>Philip Dray: Yeah, that&#8217;s a very good point, you know. People have been out to get unions through one means or another for a very long time, whether it was the misuse of the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Palmer Raids, what have you, and now this most recent assault, of course, against collective bargaining in Wisconsin and elsewhere.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: You know, speaking of that, I mean, what is so infuriating about this&#8212;the Wall Street Journal on Monday has a big story about how wages are stagnant, this is the wageless recovery. You know, unemployment has gone down to 8.8%, and we&#8217;re supposed to be happy with this, and there&#8217;s a very large number of people who can&#8217;t, have given up looking for jobs, and the people who get jobs are very often getting them below their skill set, below what they had expected. And you have, now, these multinational corporations can move their practices abroad, where they don&#8217;t have taxes to face, and they can take advantage of this reserved army of the unemployed, if you like, to drive wages down. Does this foretell a whole erosion of the American middle class that was built on good-paid jobs?</p> \n\n<p>Philip Dray: Well, I think that&#8217;s already underway. You know, I think that really a lot of people think of the PATCO strike of 1981, when Reagan got rid of all the air traffic controllers in one fell swoop, as kind of the beginning of all that. It certainly ushered in an era when workers were seen as contingent workers, as temps, they could be replaced, and so on. And then of course, again, as you point out, as the power of the corporations goes global, labor just had no way to keep up with that. And so yeah, as a result, you find the labor, you know, work force disenfranchised, in a sense. And of course now, they&#8217;re actually trying to disenfranchise and really kind of deny them some of their most essential, quasi-constitutional rights, really, for collective bargaining.</p> \n\n<p>Josh Scheer: You know, in your book, it&#8217;s not just about Reagan; you go back into the 1870s, and I was wondering about the Tompkins Square Riot. And you talk about riot after riot, and these kind of very vibrant scenes. Is that something that&#8217;s going to be required in the future, do you think? To get unions back, to have more of a, you know, there&#8217;s going to be a battle?</p> \n\n<p>Philip Dray: That&#8217;s a really good question because, you know, if they start taking away collective bargaining rights, it does cast the workers back to the conditions that they were in before collective bargaining. And of course, that&#8217;s what collective bargaining was partly meant to get rid of, to ameliorate, was this sense of working people having no rights, really. And the idea was it was part of the progressive movement of the early 20th century, what they called industrial democracy. It was literally a way to bring workers into the American system, and give them some status, some standing. And so when you take that away, yes of course, you are asking for all kinds of unseen problems.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: You know, it&#8217;s interesting, your book deals with a sort of mythology in America; the self-made person, and why do you need unions. And unions challenge that notion; they say no, it&#8217;s not a level playing field, we have to collectively work for our common rights and so forth. And we&#8217;re in a very odd moment now when you have an economic meltdown that is directly the result of Wall Street policies and government policies purchased by Wall Street, deregulation of the financial industry. And yet the people paying the price for this are unionized, primarily unionized government workers, who are being told they&#8217;ve got to take it in the neck now because of what Wall Street did. And there&#8217;s a disconnect here that the mass media doesn&#8217;t seem to comment on.</p> \n\n<p>Philip Dray: I mean, you&#8217;re right on a couple of accounts there. Of course, there&#8217;s always been that kind of myth of the rugged individual; it has always played against the collective might of unions in America. You know, that&#8217;s always been a factor. And now, you&#8217;re absolutely right of course, it&#8217;s&#8212;you know, I think it&#8217;s almost comical, if it wasn&#8217;t so tragic, that the people who are blamed now are public school teachers&#8212;of all people. Like, of all the stuff that&#8217;s gone on in the last decade, with the corporations and the big banks and whatever, the idea that it&#8217;s the fault of the public schoolteachers, who are pretty &#8230; you know, they&#8217;re a hard-bitten bunch; I mean, they work hard, they have a hard job, they don&#8217;t earn all that much money, whatever. And yeah, I mean, you know, these pensions or whatever they are were negotiated in good faith. Corporations and employers love to give away things over the rainbow, in exchange for lower wages in the near term. So then to come back years later and say, &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s your greed that&#8217;s causing all this meltdown,&#8221; yeah, of course, it&#8217;s totally fallacious.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Why did you write a book on labor? I mean, it seems sort of a thankless task. It came out in October of last year. And, you know, we don&#8217;t teach labor history in the schools; newspapers have huge business departments; sometimes they have a labor reporter; rarely, though. And what prompted you to capture this history, and why do you think it&#8217;s important, and why should people read your book?</p> \n\n<p>Philip Dray: Well, again, I think it was something&#8230;a little perverse, I agree. And I remember at the time I thought, &#8220;Gee, a book&#8230; who would even&#8230;&#8221; You know, it was not an easy sell to the publishers, to be perfectly honest. People thought &#8220;Labor history?&#8221; But yeah, I felt&#8230;you know, when you look into it, of course&#8212;you&#8217;re aware of this, I&#8217;m sure a lot of your listeners are, too&#8212;it&#8217;s an enormous history; it involves millions of people, there were all kinds of dramatic episodes and victories and setbacks. So it just seemed kind of ridiculous that it would be forgotten, particularly given the kind of pernicious assaults on unions. And going forward, I believe in the title of my book. I believe there is power in a union, and how that&#8217;ll work out in years ahead, I don&#8217;t know. But I do think, as we see recently with Wisconsin, I do think people will respond; I think people do cherish collective bargaining and other essential rights for working people, and they will collectivize and turn to those, turn to their colleagues when necessary.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Well, let&#8217;s end with a bigger plug for your book than you&#8217;re giving. I think it provides an indispensable point to the current debate that&#8217;s been ignored. The labor unions have been the main way of expanding the middle class, preserving American democracy; you capture that rich history in this book published by Doubleday, and people should go out and buy it.</p> \n\n<p>Philip Dray: Well, thank you for providing more amplitude. [Laughs]&#8230;thank you so much.</p> \n\n<p>Josh Scheer: Well, thank you for joining us, Philip. And again, go out and buy the book, &#8220;There Is Power in a Union.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>* * *Peter Scheer:</p> \n\n<p>Last week, the labor movement could be found on the streets of downtown Los Angeles. We sent Howard Stier to take a look.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: Pershing Square, a vast expanse of concrete in downtown Los Angeles, is where, during the Great Depression, authors Charles Bukowski and John Fante came to take in the pageant of human life. It&#8217;s where crowds gathered in 1960 to catch a glimpse of presidential candidate John Kennedy arriving to accept a nomination at the Democratic National Convention. And it is where thousands of union workers&#8212;truck drivers, movie technicians, farmworkers, and nurses and teachers and janitors rallied last weekend in a show of support for the beleaguered state public workers of Wisconsin. [Indistinct yelling] Timothy Sklekens, a supermarket cashier, motivated unionists from UFCW Local 770, representing food industry workers. You&#8217;re protesting Ralphs, particularly?</p> \n\n<p>Timothy Sklekens: Ralphs is one of the stores, one of the big three, that&#8217;s not negotiating contracts with us. We&#8217;ve had several meetings with them, and they&#8217;re not taking us seriously. We want a decent contract, we want a fair wage. Ralphs, Vons and Albertsons are the big three that we&#8217;re negotiating with now, and we just want a fair contract. We&#8217;re out here to show that we want a fair wage, like everybody else.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: So where does Ralphs come in?</p> \n\n<p>Timothy Sklekens: Right now, they&#8217;re negotiating, trying to [take] away our benefits again, like they do every contract. So we&#8217;re out here to fight it.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: Tim Canova is an attorney and a professor of law at Chapman University in Orange, California, and a consultant to labor organizers. He&#8217;s concerned that an assault on union rights will hinder an economic recovery.</p> \n\n<p>Tim Canova: We have a major jobs crisis, the most severe jobs recession in a century, and unions have to get on board to try to apply a lot of political pressure to create jobs. The private sector&#8217;s not creating them; the whole trend has been for austerity and budget-cutting, and now is not the time to be cutting budgets. Now is the time for the government to step up and to actually have jobs programs.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: Well, with unions, as we saw in Wisconsin, being undercut by legislators, what hope is there other than coming out in the streets?</p> \n\n<p>Tim Canova: Well, there needs to be recalls in places like Wisconsin. Politicians who think that they can just bust public-sector unions and have anti-worker policies have to pay a big price for it. And an immediate price. So the recalls that they&#8217;re now undertaking in Wisconsin&#8212;that&#8217;s the way to go. The biggest inequality in income since the Gilded Age. You know, Wall Street executives haven&#8217;t been taking a hit at all; their salaries, their bonuses, keep going higher and higher. They&#8217;re the ones that wrecked this economy, not the teachers, not labor, not workers, organized or unorganized. And while wages are going down, that hurts the economy for everyone. You need more purchasing power in the economy. You see, right now, gas prices going up again, more than four dollars a gallon here at the pump in California. That means less money for people to spend on all other kinds of things. So it has ripple effects throughout the entire economy. And it&#8217;s all part of this fantasy that if you could just get rid of government, somehow the private sector will create jobs. That&#8217;s never been the way that jobs and economic development has occurred in this country. So regulation is only a bad word when the regulators get captured by industry. Howie Stier: Draped in a neon-colored toga, L.A. performance artist Ari Kletzky was inspired to transform himself into a polychrome Statue of Liberty to make a stand for workers&#8217; rights. He was accompanied by costume designer Rachel Weir. Can you tell me about your outfit here today?</p> \n\n<p>Ari Kletzky: We are celebrating liberty and justice, which is the ability for everyone to have the freedom to influence our government without being controlled by other people&#8217;s privilege and wealth.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: OK, all these union members out here, they&#8217;re also protesting and exercising their rights; they&#8217;re just not dressed in every swath of fabric you could buy in Santee Alley. What explains this outfit&#8212;or do you dress like this every day?</p> \n\n<p>Rachel Weir: I wanted to participate in this protest as an artist, and so I&#8217;m a costume designer and I express myself through costume. And I wanted to explore the celebratory nature of justice, and to me that means bright colors, that means psychedelic, that means wearing a wig, that means going in drag. It means being fabulous.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: Are you pretty busy, are you working?</p> \n\n<p>Rachel Weir: Ah, a little bit. Wish I was working more, but I&#8217;m doing some footwork. I&#8217;m becoming a member of the Costumers Local 705. And I&#8217;m making contacts through there, and being a part of a community.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: You plan to join a union&#8212;are they going to get a job for you, or do you have to have a job before you join a union?</p> \n\n<p>Rachel Weir: I currently have a job that gave me the opportunity to join the union.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: Patrick Kelly is the secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local [952] from Orange County, California.</p> \n\n<p>Patrick Kelly: My name&#8217;s Patrick Kelly, I&#8217;m with Teamsters Local 952.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: How many people are in your union?</p> \n\n<p>Patrick Kelly: There&#8217;s about 9,000 active, and there&#8217;s about 1,300 or 1,400 that are out of work right now.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: How long have those 1,300 been out of work?</p> \n\n<p>Patrick Kelly: For the last year and a half, two years.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: And what&#8217;s your message here today?</p> \n\n<p>Patrick Kelly: Our message is that union people need to band together, register to vote, raise money for their packs, and start directly confronting the non-union employers, and pushing wages and benefits up.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: Governor Brown just announced billions of dollars in cuts. Is that affecting your union members?</p> \n\n<p>Patrick Kelly: Yeah, it&#8217;s affecting everybody. And my remedy on that is, let&#8217;s have a tax on the oil industry at the well head, and raise some serious money, because everybody&#8217;s getting killed on their gas and diesel prices. We need to recover that money from the oil companies and the energy companies at the point of production. Thoughts on what Obama could do to stimulate jobs for union members&#8212;stop supporting the hedge fund Democrats and the financial class, and start creating some jobs for working people and the unemployed.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: Phillip Mesa is an affable, 40-year-old grocery clerk who stocks the dairy department in an Albertson&#8217;s store in Ontario, California. He is also the rapper known as Mr. Picket Man.</p> \n\n<p>Phillip Mesa: My name is Phillip Mesa.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: You&#8217;re a union activist?</p> \n\n<p>Phillip Mesa: Yes, a union activist, union member. I&#8217;m on the executive board for my local UFCW Local 1428. I&#8217;m an Albertson&#8217;s employee that&#8217;s been with Albertson&#8217;s for 20 years.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: What does the store think about your rapping and Mr. Picket Man?</p> \n\n<p>Phillip Mesa: A lot of the stores, especially some of the recent management that I&#8217;ve had, they understand that it&#8217;s not that we want to set the company down, because we need the company to have our jobs. We just want the company to negotiate fairly with us as workers, and I feel most of the managers that I&#8217;ve worked for in the past two years understand that&#8212;the union would rather work with the company than work against the company. And I think they appreciate me; I&#8217;m honest with them and they&#8217;re honest with me.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: What&#8217;s your hourly wage at Albertsons?</p> \n\n<p>Phillip Mesa: Ah, $19.55, with Albertsons.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: That&#8217;s after 20 years.</p> \n\n<p>Phillip Mesa: Yeah, that&#8217;s at the top. The new ones are starting basically at minimum wage; I&#8217;m at the end, one of the last, the dying breed that probably has made this a career. A lot of the new hires, I mean a lot of the new ones won&#8217;t stick around to reach that point. The ones that are like me, myself, I mean, as we retire and get older and phase out of the industry, it&#8217;s going to be, basically, I feel that they&#8217;re just going to try to squeeze it down to a low-paying, low-wage job with high turnover rate, just to keep their costs down, just like a Wal-Mart does or something like that. And we just want to return it to the status that it once was, and that&#8217;s to be a good quality career, job.</p> \n\n<p>Howie Stier: We take you out with Mr. Picket Man&#8217;s workers&#8217; rap, &#8220;Fight On.&#8221; [Rap music playing]</p> \n\n<p>* * *Peter Scheer:</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;m Peter Scheer with Josh Scheer, and we&#8217;re speaking with Truthdig sports writer, and L.A. Times sports writer, Mark Heisler. And we want to ask, as part of this national-themed show about labor&#8212;broaden the discussion and talk a little bit about sports labor. Because really, as you outline in your newest Truthdig piece, Mark, sports is an area where labor movements have been very successful.</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: It&#8217;s a weird, ah&#8230;really stretching the term labor, there. [Laughter] Because, you know, the labor is rich, by and large.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: Right.</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: So&#8230;and in baseball, the labor kind of runs the game; it&#8217;s really more powerful than the administration. So it&#8217;s kind of a, it&#8217;s definitely a specialized area of labor.</p> \n\n<p>Josh Scheer: I had a quick question, though, for the KPFK audience, because I&#8217;ve always actually wondered this, and I was trying to find this out. Do the major league baseball players&#8217; union, the NBA union&#8212;maybe you don&#8217;t know, maybe no one knows this&#8212;but do they actually support the public service unions and other unions, or is it kind of they&#8217;re out for themselves?</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: I don&#8217;t really know the answer to that, but my impression is&#8212;I&#8217;ve never read anything or heard anything about it&#8212;I think they&#8217;re pretty much, you know, like stand-alone entities. I don&#8217;t think they have very much to do with each other. Except there is some crossover&#8212;I think there&#8217;s a guy named Jeff Kessler, if I got the name right [Laughter]&#8212;I&#8217;m always getting, I get the Jeffs mixed up back there, and you know, some of them work for the league and some of them work for the NBA. But if I got the right one, you know, I think he may be doing some stuff for the NFL union right now&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Josh Scheer: Yeah. And he also does some stuff for the NBA too.</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: Yeah, his big thing is the NBA. And in management, too, Gary Bettman, who runs the NHL &#8230; was David Stern&#8217;s right-hand man. There was some crossover, you know, within sports. But there isn&#8217;t a whole lot outside of that, even if some very important people, like Marvin Miller, you know, came to baseball, came to the baseball union, I think he was like a steelworkers guy or somethin&#8217;.</p> \n\n<p>Josh Scheer: Yeah, Howard Ganz, also, he reps both the NBA and the NFL in terms of the management side [Laughs], as an attorney. But it&#8217;s interesting, though, because these unions are very successful and they&#8217;re very big, but we do&#8212;you know, the other unions that are in trouble&#8230;these, I mean, these unions expect us to go, like, &#8220;Oh, $9.3 billion, that&#8217;s a lot of money.&#8221; Right? So you&#8217;d think they&#8217;d want to support the lower-end unions, but&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: The union movement in general, you know, there&#8217;s&#8230;you talk about workers and solidarity, and supporting each other&#8230;You know, I think everybody kind of understands, as athletes and owners of sports teams, that&#8217;s a whole different thing; it&#8217;s just like its own little niche. And it&#8217;s an elite niche on both sides. And it doesn&#8217;t have very much to do with the outside world. So baseball owners&#8230;don&#8217;t have very much to do with U.S. Steel or anything like that.</p> \n\n<p>Josh Scheer: No.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: But there was a time when that wasn&#8217;t the case. And you had in the, I forget what year it was, but back when basketball, when the NBA was a struggling entity and the players showed some solidarity, the famous players and the less-famous players, refusing to play in the all-star game that year.</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: Oh yeah, I think [there&#8217;s] solidarity within the unions and within the sports&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: But there was a time when they weren&#8217;t, you know, pulling together for millions and millions of dollars for the richest among them. There was a time when it was just about having some basic standards, right, some basic safety? Mark Heisler: Oh yeah, absolutely. That was one of the hallmarks of the NBA, you know&#8230;the birth of the NBA union, was the big guys&#8212;the Tommy Heinsohns and the Bob Cousys and the Oscar Robertsons and the Elgin Baylors&#8212;they were standing up for the little guys, and that was the&#8230;tradition of the NBA union into the &#8217;90s. And Isiah Thomas, who was castigated for just about everything, people forget he was the last of the big stars who was the president of the union, who was running it for the little guys. And then the David Falk people got in, and David Falk started putting his star clients in important positions in the union, and trying to run it for the stars. And now I think they&#8217;re kind of back to where they were&#8212;the last couple of player heads have been Derek Fisher and Michael Curry&#8212;I think they&#8217;re back to where they were. On the other hand, no matter what they were doing, when the NBA players started the union they didn&#8217;t have very much awareness of the garment workers&#8217; union, or anything like that.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: Right.</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: It was basically&#8230;it was basketball players taking care of basketball players.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: What is the status of the labor movement, or the labor relations in sports now? There&#8217;s a lot of news with the NFL and the NBA maybe having lockout seasons, and how powerful are they still?</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: I think it varies dramatically from sport to sport. Very interestingly, there was a guy named Sal Galioto, I think is his name; he&#8217;s a New York investment guy&#8230;and he specializes in sports stuff, and he set up a company, and he was on CNBC and he was talking about the NFL and the NBA. And the point he made about the NFL was he thinks&#8230;business is so great that they&#8217;ll make a deal, that they&#8217;ll just have to make a deal, because that&#8217;s what logic dictates; there&#8217;s just no reason for them to lose games or lose the season because they are making a lot of money. Whereas he thinks the NBA is not doing that well, and the owners are very united, and it&#8217;s a whole different situation. And I think that&#8217;s true. On the other hand, I have a big question about whether the NBA is doing actually as badly as David Stern says it is, and you can find a wide divergence of opinion on that matter. On the other hand, Stern has been very, very successful in convincing just about everybody that the NBA owners are in extremely dire straits.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: I want to ask you about football, Mark, because you write in your latest <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">column</a> that if the NFL flew, like Icarus, too close to the sun, [NFL Commissioner Roger] Goodell would just have the orb moved. The NFL is wildly successful, and you say the players&#8217; union there has also been really successful. And at the same time you have this stuff coming out, with these head injuries, guys in their 40s getting Alzheimer&#8217;s, you know, the less famous people&#8212;they don&#8217;t have guaranteed contracts, they have&#8212;it&#8217;s not like the NBA, where they can make a few million and retire. You know, what&#8217;s wrong there, what&#8217;s&#8230;?</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: Well, there&#8217;s a very different dynamic in each sport about the relative strength of the union. The NFL union, although it has managed to exist and still is a force, is not very strong vis-&#224;-vis the owner. The owner&#8212;the NFL is a sport in which the owners have always dominated. And for&#8230;the evidence is just&#8230;the things you just mentioned, especially guaranteed contracts. And they have a hard cap, you know&#8230;they have the most owner-friendly system of the American professional sports leagues. The NBA&#8212;it&#8217;s a pretty even contest between management and the union. The management tends to think that it has the upper hand in it, and they&#8217;re all saying that they think that the union is going to fold. There&#8217;s only been one test, and the union held right up until January and the drop-dead date, and then both sides made concessions and made a deal. So that&#8217;s kind of an ongoing contest. In baseball, the union is extremely powerful. Having&#8230;they&#8217;ve had a lot of tests, I forget how many stoppages, four or five. And of course in [1994] they burned the World Series and really, essentially, taught the owners a lesson. And the owners have never really challenged them since. That&#8217;s why there&#8217;s a completely player-friendly system now; there&#8217;s no salary cap whatsoever; there&#8217;s minor restrictions about, you know, luxury tax. But what baseball has done is&#8230;they&#8217;ve done a very good job of redistributing income, you know, with a revenue sharing plan, so that everybody&#8217;s making money. Now the one thing that the NBA owners have not done is&#8230;they claim&#8230;they&#8217;re talking about a $400 million operating loss, and I think it&#8217;s completely wrong. I think they&#8217;re tossing non-operating expenditures in there, like debt service. And I think the real number is the one that Forbes comes out with, and Forbes&#8217; figure for last season was&#8230;plus $150 million profit, except that most of it went to about five teams, and I think they had 12 teams making money and 18 teams losing by the end of it. I think the way it really breaks down is like five or six teams making almost all the real money, and about 10 of them lose a lot.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: Well, I guess the moral of the story is that even when the laborers are millionaires, you can&#8217;t trust management, right, Josh?</p> \n\n<p>Josh Scheer: Yeah. And thank you, Mark, and again, we&#8217;ll continue this discussion because I&#8217;m sure this won&#8217;t go anywhere.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: All right. That&#8217;s Mark Heisler joining us to talk about sports. Thanks, Mark.</p> \n\n<p>Mark Heisler: My pleasure.</p> \n\n<p>* * *Peter Scheer:</p> \n\n<p>This is Peter Scheer with Kasia Anderson, and we&#8217;re joined by Bill Boyarsky and Jim Mamer as part of this special, national broadcast on the theme of labor. Their two pieces are &#8220;Flunking Teachers Gives the Ruling Class a Pass,&#8221; by Bill Boyarsky, and &#8220;Time for a Little Education,&#8221; by Jim Mamer.</p> \n\n<p>Kasia Anderson: And Jim&#8212;this is Kasia&#8212;I wanted to ask you, just by way of kicking off here &#8230; we can&#8217;t say your exact quotation on the radio here, but I&#8217;ll paraphrase. You say, &#8220;I&#8217;m a retired teacher, and I&#8217;m ticked off.&#8221; That&#8217;s what opens your piece. Do you want to give us an idea of what got you going there?</p> \n\n<p>Jim Mamer: You mean &#8230; I&#8217;m not ticked off all the time.</p> \n\n<p>Kasia Anderson: No, right, right. Yeah, very good-natured individual, but in this case, you make an exception.</p> \n\n<p>Jim Mamer: You know, it&#8217;s been pretty obvious over a while, but the economic problems and the debt crisis in general, and complex problems in education have seemed to be reduced to an attack on government workers, and teachers in particular. So it is kind of offensive to be offered bumper-sticker solutions to everything. And I guess in this case it&#8217;s &#8220;fire bad teachers.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: Bill, on this note, you start your column by saying &#8220;With all the evil people in the world, why are public school teachers being villainized, and how did they attract such powerful enemies?&#8221; And you&#8217;ve gone out in the field to look into this question. What did you find?</p> \n\n<p>Bill Boyarsky: I found that there&#8217;s people who are in favor of so-called education reform that tend to be business people, such as&#8212;forward-looking business people such as Bill Gates at Microsoft, Arne Duncan, the secretary of education in the Obama administration. And then a lot of investors, hedge-fund investors and other investors in charter schools, which are basically government-financed, privately operated schools, that are, in a sense, privatizing the &#8230; public schools. So there&#8217;s an economic motive, and then there&#8217;s a strong ideological motive, this sort of business &#8220;if I could just get in there with this enterprise, and clean it up, and fire all the incompetents, and cut down the workforce, everything would be fine.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Kasia Anderson: Yeah, you&#8217;ve made the comparison to basically like corporate raiders, right? Where they just come in and sweep through the place and fire everyone right and left, and try to restructure.</p> \n\n<p>Bill Boyarsky: Right. Right, Kasia, with the know-it-all CEO coming in, you know, with all of the answers, to what is an extremely complex situation.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: Jim, you&#8217;re not just a teacher&#8212;or I should say a retired teacher&#8212;but you were a great teacher. You won a national award for your teaching. And I want to know why, as other groups like the police and firemen are able to say &#8220;Hey, if you don&#8217;t treat us right you&#8217;re going to, what, have crime and danger and &#8230;&#8221; you know, why is it with teachers we&#8217;re able to say, &#8220;Your kids are going to end up dumb if you don&#8217;t hire good teachers.&#8221; We want to be competitive in the world, so we&#8217;re going to take it out on teachers; we&#8217;re going to have fewer teachers who are going to be less well paid. I mean, isn&#8217;t this a recipe for disaster?</p> \n\n<p>Jim Mamer: Oh, it&#8217;s definitely a recipe for disaster. I&#8217;m not sure that the police and the firefighters are actually as immune to those attacks as that sounds. But in terms of teachers, I think there&#8217;s two contradictory messages that are being sent out at the same time. And one of them, obviously, we talked about, is that teacher unions are the major obstacle to effective reform; I&#8217;ve never thought teachers&#8217; unions should be primarily about reform anyway. I mean, teacher unions are there to protect teachers. But they&#8217;re being cast as the main reason we don&#8217;t have reform, and you end up at the same time with this&#8212;especially from the Obama administration, and I suspect almost every officeholder&#8212;saying we need more teachers; we&#8217;ve got the baby boom retiring, and we need good teachers, and this is a great job. There was an article this morning in the L.A. Times talking about the same thing. The fact that the number of people who are entering the teaching profession has fallen&#8212;I think this is just about the state of California&#8212;by 29 percent in the last couple of years. So you&#8212;we&#8217;ve really got a problem coming up. You can&#8217;t attack teachers, attack their pensions, attack virtually everything they&#8217;re doing in the classroom, and also call for more people to want to be teachers. And yeah, I think we&#8217;re headed to &#8230; in a real bad direction.</p> \n\n<p>Kasia Anderson: Bill, I wanted to ask you, from your column&#8212;one of the things I love the most about your writing is that you actually go out on the street and into institutions in various parts of society and you talk to people. It&#8217;s, you know, Basic Reporting 101, but seems like it&#8217;s lacking these days. You went to a couple of different places and talked to people about your most recent piece. What did you find, kind of out there in the world?</p> \n\n<p>Bill Boyarsky: Well, I went to a new high school in Los Angeles, the Robert Kennedy educational complex; it&#8217;s built on the site of the old Ambassador Hotel, where Robert Kennedy was assassinated in 1968. And there are six small high schools on this site, and they, some of them, specialize in music or theater or just basic high school. The one I visited was run by the UCLA School of Education and the Los Angeles School District, and it was &#8230; a general high school. And it&#8217;s also, these high schools&#8212;they&#8217;re called pilot schools&#8212;they&#8217;re also deeply involved in the teachers&#8217; union. The teachers&#8217; union helps shape the high school, as do the faculty and the administrators on the site. I found that they conduct themselves in a way that&#8217;s really contrary to what the so-called reformers believe in, which is&#8212;you know, they believe in testing, testing of students; comparison of the test scores of one teacher with another, and all of that. And they [the RFK schools] have rather a long and complex system of evaluation of teachers by the principal, by peers, and by outside groups. And they actually look at the work product of the students and the quality of the assignments, and they compare the assignments to the work product. They realize&#8212;and I agree&#8212;that, you know, teachers should be evaluated, and done in a systematic way. And that if a teacher isn&#8217;t cutting it, the teacher should go. The teachers at this school, under their union contract, they sign one-year contracts. And if they&#8217;re not making it at the end of the year, then they&#8217;re not picked up the following year. They have to go somewhere else. And so there is a system of evaluation, and there are standards. But it&#8217;s one that reflects the realities of the classroom, and that&#8217;s what impressed me. I was also impressed by just walking around the campus and looking at how such a large school, which could be like a lot of big-city schools&#8212;you know, this inhuman fortress&#8212;was really made into an open and pleasant place. Jim Mamer: I think you&#8217;ve probably all seen the &#8220;Waiting for Superman&#8221; documentary?</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: Right.</p> \n\n<p>Jim Mamer: That begins&#8212;somewhere near the beginning is this guy, Geoffrey Canada, who looks at the camera and simply says, &#8220;Public school &#8230; this thing is just an utter failure.&#8221; Well, it&#8217;s not just an utter failure; there are really good schools out there. And the ones that are being lauded, the charter schools in that film&#8212;it&#8217;s interesting; I have no objection to charter schools. But if you look at the research, they have just as many successful schools&#8212;I think if I remember the research right from a couple of years ago, 17 percent of charter schools are doing better than their neighboring public schools; 37 percent are doing worse. And the rest are about the same. Well, that&#8217;s not a nut film. So you have this guy saying it&#8217;s an utter failure, and I think people want to believe it. There&#8217;s even one point in that film where Eric Hanushek, who&#8217;s an economist with the Hoover Institute, looks at this chart and says if you fire 5 to 10 percent of the bad teachers and replace them with average, not outstanding, teachers but average teachers, the American educational system will be equal to Finland. And Finland keeps coming up No. 1 or No. 2 on all of the international tests. It&#8217;s just crazy. Somehow we&#8217;ve focused only on the performance of teachers, and we&#8217;ve got this stereotype that the entire public school system&#8217;s failing. It&#8217;s not.</p> \n\n<p>Kasia Anderson: Bill, maybe for one last question, can you give us your take on what the main sort of opposition to teachers, the party lines are, and maybe how to refute them?</p> \n\n<p>Bill Boyarsky: The main attack on teachers comes from the use of tests, especially one called the value-added test, which is&#8212;the value-added examinations, which are&#8212;which the Los Angeles Times has done a series of stories comparing the value-added scores of teachers in elementary schools in the Los Angeles School District and, you know, publishing the names and the scores of these teachers. These, basically, without getting too complicated&#8212;you take the test scores of the kid at the end of one semester, and from that you kind of project what the kid should do into the next semester, and if the kid does better, that&#8217;s what they call &#8220;added value,&#8221; and that&#8217;s good for the teacher; and if the kid does worse, then that&#8217;s bad for the teacher, and the teacher has a lower score. I&#8217;m vastly oversimplifying. But there seems to be a feeling&#8212;and I mean, it&#8217;s kind of like business, you know; it&#8217;s like &#8230; you can quantify everything. Everything can be quantified, and from your quantifying it, you can get dead-sure results that one teacher is better than another. Well, as a matter of fact, there&#8217;s a good amount of margin of error in this value-added system. And so the difference between the teacher who has a high value-added score and one that has an average one is pretty hard to measure. That&#8217;s one really big objection to what they&#8217;re doing with teachers. Why&#8212;I just don&#8217;t know why, though&#8212;the media, and these business leaders like Gates and like Arne Duncan, are focusing on teachers, because they&#8217;re kind of inflaming this. And, you know, a lot of things about teachers are&#8212;people like their kid&#8217;s teacher, the one they have them in contact with, usually. But then, they may not like the system.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: Well, that&#8217;s, regretfully, all the time we have, but I want to thank you both for joining us.</p> \n\n<p>Jim Mamer: Thank you. I enjoyed it.</p> \n\n<p>Bill Boyarsky: Me, too.</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: They are Bill Boyarsky, Truthdig reporter at large, and Jim Mamer, a veteran teacher&#8212;and a good one, by the way&#8212;now retired. Thanks for being with us, guys.</p> \n\n<p>Kasia Anderson: Thank you.</p> \n\n<p>Bill Boyarsky: Bye-bye.</p> \n\n<p>* * *Peter Scheer:</p> \n\n<p>Welcome back. We are speaking with Dolores Huerta, the co-founder of the United Farm Workers union, and Paul Schrade, a former officer of the United Auto Workers union [UAW], who just won an award from the Cesar Chavez Foundation.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: You know, let me&#8212;this is Robert Scheer&#8212;let me set this up. I recall when Paul was&#8212;I think you were the West Coast regional director of the United Auto Workers &#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: I was on the national board.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: &#8230; yeah, on the national board. And you did two things that I thought were really quite remarkable. You were the first major labor leader to come out against the Vietnam War, even though some of your workers that you represented were working in the defense industry. And the other thing you did that was so gutsy is you supported the farmworkers. And maybe, Dolores, do you have memory of that time? Could you say something about that?</p> \n\n<p>Dolores Huerta: Oh, absolutely. Not only did Paul support the farmworkers, but there were busloads of autoworkers that would come from Los Angeles to come to the picket lines, and then Paul actually brought <a href=\"http://www.aflcio.org/aboutus/history/history/reuther.cfm\" type=\"external\">Walter Reuther</a> himself to the Forty Acres, you know, to Delano, to be there with us. And of course it was also through Paul Schrade that we formed our connection with Robert Kennedy, Sen. Robert Kennedy. So Paul was a&#8212;I might have called him the padrino in Spanish, and it&#8217;s got a better connotation in Spanish than in English, but the godfather [Laughs] of the farmworkers&#8217; union, because Paul&#8212;not only was he helping us back then, but he&#8217;s been helping throughout all of these years to support the farmworkers. And also just for my foundation, for community organizing, Paul is on my board; I&#8217;m really proud to say that. But his influence was very, very huge. And as you know, at that time the autoworkers were not part of the AFL-CIO. And so we were, you know, we didn&#8217;t really have that support of labor, and at that point in time I think it was only the UAW, I believe the <a href=\"http://www.ilwu.org/%20\" type=\"external\">ILWU</a>, and I believe it was also the Newspaper Guild that was supportive of our fledgling union then, of the National Farm Workers&#8217; Association.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: You mentioned bringing Bobby Kennedy, but it was Paul Schrade who was standing next to Bobby Kennedy when he was assassinated. And, Paul, you were very severely injured. And while that, obviously, was a traumatic moment, those days represent sort of a high point for trade unionism in America. And it&#8217;s been downhill since, and now we have a challenge to the very idea of collective bargaining, and so forth. Can you describe the arc as you&#8217;ve seen it?</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: Well, a lot of high points &#8230; the recognition [by] General Motors of the sit-down strikes in the late &#8217;30s is important. And I also think that we&#8217;re on our way now to a new birth &#8230; of the labor movement with the terrible action by Republican governors and the Congress against workers. And I see the labor movement beginning to rise again.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: And what about this victory&#8212;I&#8217;ve seen some signs of it&#8212;a victory in California that will go against this grain of reactionary governors, that maybe our Legislature and our governor will sign off something on legislation that will help the farmworkers &#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: No&#8212;Dolores probably knows more about this than I do, but the L.A. Times reported that the California state Senate passed a law providing for a card check rather than a vote of workers, in order to get bargaining rights. And it&#8217;s been passed by the Senate, and probably will be passed by the Assembly; of course would be signed by Jerry Brown. And Jerry Brown is &#8230; not like those people, the governors in Wisconsin, Ohio and the other states, where they&#8217;re attacking laborers&#8217; rights.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Do you have a comment on that, Dolores?</p> \n\n<p>Dolores Huerta: I hope the governor signs it. I&#8217;m just getting a little concerned about, you know, what he&#8217;s facing up against with his budget deficit, and he&#8217;s gotten the Chamber of Commerce to endorse the extension of these taxes that he&#8217;s trying to extend. I don&#8217;t know how that would affect what the governor does in terms of the card check for the farmworkers. I would hope that if it passes the Assembly&#8212;we know it&#8217;s passed the Senate&#8212;that he would be able to sign it this year. If he doesn&#8217;t sign it this year, I know that Jerry Brown, we can count on him to &#8230; sign it the next year. And I&#8217;m just&#8212;this is my opinion; I haven&#8217;t spoken to the governor [Laughs], so I don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s doing on this issue. I know it&#8217;s a very big issue, not only for the farmworkers, but you know, it&#8217;s an issue for all of labor. I think all of the labor unions should have the ability to have workers choose their labor representative by their signature. And I always like to say, if your signature&#8217;s good enough to buy a home, open a bank account, get your passport, you know, buy an automobile, get your driver&#8217;s license, get a marriage or a divorce, it ought to be good enough to choose your union, right? And they should make it as easy as possible. And I think this whole attack on labor is very scary, because labor is of course what creates the middle class of our country. And if you get rid of labor unions, you get rid of the middle class; if you get rid of the middle class, you get rid of democracy. So then you have a plutocracy, and this is really, really scary, what&#8217;s happening right now, and I think a lot of people don&#8217;t realize this. And not only the attack on collective bargaining, you know, the attacks on teachers, the public employees; and then going after their retirement, after their pensions. You know, people don&#8217;t realize that when you negotiate&#8212;I know Paul&#8217;s been at the bargaining table, I&#8217;ve been at the bargaining table for farmworkers&#8212;when you negotiate a pension for workers, you&#8217;re giving up part of wages. So workers have given up part of their wages to be able to have some kind of retirement in the future, and now you hear all this talk about going after the pensions of the public employees, and other workers. So it&#8217;s a very vicious attack that&#8217;s going on right now. Instead of attacking the people that created this mess&#8212;which are the financial managers and the people who really don&#8217;t do any physical work, right, but just manage other people&#8217;s money, and have gotten our country into such a big mess&#8212;they&#8217;re going after the working people who create the wealth of the country. So it&#8217;s a very, very scary situation.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Yeah, and it&#8217;s a historic scapegoating situation. Here we had this banking meltdown that has impoverished the nation, and then they want to blame immigrants; they want to blame union people; it&#8217;s absolutely bizarre. And professor [Joseph] Stiglitz, winner of the Nobel Prize, Columbia professor, has an article in Vanity Fair this month saying, you know, pointing out that 1 percent of the people in this country control 40 percent of the wealth. And you use the word plutocracy&#8212;I mean, it&#8217;s incredible! And yet we have this tea party movement, we have outrage, what, about teachers getting a pension. It&#8217;s bizarre. And what happened to the relationship&#8212;was it the government attacks on labor, was it corporate attacks on labor&#8212;what has happened to the situation of the labor unions in this country?</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: It&#8217;s all that big money going into the war against labor, and to control the government. Eisenhower talked about the military-industrial complex, but what he left out, a point that he was going to make, and that is that the big money buys the Congress. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened. It&#8217;s controlled not just by the Koch brothers, but all the other corporations that buy into the presidency and also into the Congress.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Well, take us back to that moment when Bobby Kennedy was both against the war in Vietnam, against the military-industrial complex, and came out in support of the farmworkers. Can the two of you describe that? When I mention that it&#8217;s a high point in our country, I don&#8217;t mean that it was the only great victory, but it was a moment in which there was a lot of idealism felt about, at least, the farmworkers, and the possibility for progress, and &#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: Well, let&#8217;s start with the victory first. Dolores was with us that night, and was in the pantry when we lost Robert Kennedy. But the important part of that day was that the farmworkers, under &#8230; with the leadership of Dolores and Cesar [Chavez], were campaigning in all of the districts in Los Angeles. And when [Kennedy aide] Frank Mankiewicz got word that the polls had closed in East L.A. and in Watts, in the black community, he sent out scouts that said why are these polls closing, and the guys came back laughing, because by 3 and 4 o&#8217;clock, a hundred percent of the people had voted in many of those precincts. Because Cesar and Dolores were out there, getting voters out, and that&#8217;s the reason Robert Kennedy won that primary. And Dolores was with us that night, celebrating that victory, and also facing that tragedy, for us and for the country, when Bob was killed. Robert Scheer: How do you&#8212;you know, Dolores, I want to ask you&#8212;how do you guys keep going, you know? I mean, you&#8217;ve been at this a long time, you and Paul. And how do you keep up your spirit, your idealism, you&#8217;re still out there organizing, you&#8217;re still optimistic &#8230; what do you drink? What&#8217;s the secret, here?</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: [Laughs] No, it&#8217;s the passion for justice, for one thing, and the fact that we have been effective in many ways; we&#8217;ve lost a lot of battles, but we&#8217;re effective. Dolores worked with us on getting the Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools built, after we were opposed by Donald Trump and by the school board and by the [Los Angeles] Conservancy. We won that school; it was a 23-year fight, but we did it. And that keeps me going after, you know, you walk into that school now and see the kids, thirty-five hundred kids are going to a very marvelously constructed school.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: This is the same location where you were shot, and where Bobby Kennedy was killed.</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: Yeah.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Right, yeah.</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: In fact, during the dedication, on November 13th&#8212;Dolores was with us then&#8212;we were standing, when we were speaking, right where Robert Kennedy made his victory speech. But that location, which was the Embassy Ballroom, is now the library. And it&#8217;s such a beautiful structure now, all the false ceilings and draperies out of there, it&#8217;s just a beautiful room, an exact replica of the Embassy Ballroom where Bob made his victory speech. And Bill Rosendahl, who was with us that night too, just was in tears, because it was such a happy moment to have that library and that school dedicated for the people.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Bill Rosendahl [is now] on the City Council. You know, I was there that night, and I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ve ever been in a more depressing scene; I had just interviewed Bobby Kennedy upstairs; John Lewis, the great congressman from Georgia, was crying on the floor, a civil rights veteran. So, Dolores, how do you pick yourself up each time, and keep going? I mean, you&#8217;ve spoken in my classes; I know you have this enormous enthusiasm. What keeps you going? We need some optimism now.</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: She&#8217;s great.</p> \n\n<p>Dolores Huerta: Well, it&#8217;s like Paul said&#8212;we&#8217;ve been through &#8230; social justice, right, and that gives us the energy. And Cesar always used to say that &#8230; the struggle itself gives you the energy to continue, and not to give up. And that&#8217;s the other thing I love to quote about Cesar, since we&#8217;re celebrating his birthday, is he always said that you&#8217;re always going to win as long as you don&#8217;t quit. No matter how long it takes &#8230; ultimately you will win, as long as you don&#8217;t quit; that&#8217;s the important thing. And the other thing I love to quote Cesar on, when he talked about nonviolence, you know&#8212;nonviolence also means having the patience to hang in there. To know it&#8217;s not going to happen quickly, that it&#8217;s going to take a lot of work to achieve the justice that we&#8217;re seeking, that we&#8217;re working for. And you know the other thing&#8212;I just want to comment on something that you mentioned a little while ago, about how California, we were so different than the rest of the country&#8212;and I want to give credit again to the labor movement, especially to Maria Elena Durazo, who is the head of the labor council there in Los Angeles. But you know, I had the good fortune, at her invitation, to join some of those people that were walking the precincts in this last election, and who were they? They were immigrants; they were the people from the hotels; they were the people from the&#8212;the janitors, you know? You know, the homemakers &#8230; the hotel keepers, and you know, this is like immigrant people, you know, that have just become citizens, and many of them were not yet citizens, that were knocking on those doors in Los Angeles in this last election, and they knocked on over 300,000 doors. And we saw somewhat of a miracle, I call it, because we ended up with the most progressive slate in the country, you know. From Jerry Brown, Kamala Harris&#8212;the first African-American, also [Asian] Indian, woman to be elected to [the attorney general&#8217;s] office, you know, in the state. And all of the constitutional offices were from Northern California, and they were elected with the Latino votes from Southern California. And I think that&#8217;s just incredible, and I think that sets a model for the rest of the country. That they&#8217;ve got to realize that the only way we&#8217;re going to win, and we&#8217;re going to counteract the tea baggers and these anti-union, anti-immigrant, anti-women&#8212;because, you know, they&#8217;re also going after choice and after the LGBT community&#8212;the only way that we can counteract that is with organizing on the ground. And this is what laborers do, this is what labor unions do. And this is why they want to get rid of labor unions. And I think the governor of Wisconsin said, well, if we get rid of the labor unions then we get rid of the Democrats. And if we get rid of the Democrats and we get rid of labor unions, then the Republicans have complete control, and they&#8217;ve already shown us what they&#8217;re trying to do; you know, by getting rid of education and privatizing education, privatizing everything. So &#8230; and I know people don&#8217;t like to use that word, fascism, but this is where we&#8217;re at; this is the road that these people want to put us on. And I think it&#8217;s up to us to fight back. We have to remind people that Hitler was elected to office, you know? It wasn&#8217;t a coup; he was elected. And that we see some of the same patterns there; the xenophobia, the fighting people of color, wanting to put everybody in prison. It&#8217;s really scary.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Yeah, you know, it&#8217;s an important point, I think maybe the most important point, to be made. Because we&#8217;ve really seen a classic bait-and-switch, you know; we&#8217;ve seen the hijacking of what should be a real populism and are given a phony populism. So instead of focusing attention on Wall Street&#8212;on the big corporate, on the big banks and the damage they did to everybody in this country, beginning with working people&#8212;instead, we have the blame, as I said before, on the immigrants and now on the teachers, and on people working in the public sector, on unionized workers. But what&#8217;s so positive about what you&#8217;ve just said&#8212;and I think we need to hear this from time to time&#8212;is that California did not go the way of the rest of the country. California&#8212;which, you know, is not Greenwich Village; it&#8217;s not some isolated, bohemian center&#8212;California gave us Richard Nixon, it gave us Ronald Reagan&#8212;you know, it&#8217;s a real state, and the most important state, I would argue. And yet in this last election&#8212;and the media didn&#8217;t notice it, really, very much&#8212;California went the other way. And I think your point, Dolores, is really the one to take away from this: It is the role of the immigrant labor force that the unions have so effectively organized in California. And that has changed the whole balance.</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: And just like it was the workforce back in the &#8217;30s, when the UAW first got organized; a lot of those people were from the South and the Midwest, and they really carried the ball, and through sit-down strikes, changed the life of workers in the automobile industry.</p> \n\n<p>Dolores Huerta: Right, and they&#8217;re celebrating 100 years of the <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2011/3/25/100th_anniversary_of_the_triangle_shirtwaist%20\" type=\"external\">Triangle Shirtwaist fire</a> in New York, you know, when the garment workers&#8212;you know, out of that tragedy came the garment workers&#8217; union &#8230; that was organized. And then that, of course, led the way to many of the other labor unions, also, that happened on the East Coast after that tragic fire, which killed all these young women that were locked into a building, and they couldn&#8217;t get out. All these shirt-makers, these young women who sat at their sewing machines. So, and that was an immigrant labor force at that time also, that worked in those garment factories. So we know that the working people are really the ones that are the engine of the economy, the engine of progress, and if anything, if our country has gone down the tube economically, it&#8217;s because we have disdained our working people, we&#8217;ve taken their jobs away and sent them overseas, and we&#8217;re just making them into a nation of bankers. And this is very wrong. But we&#8217;ve got to kind of remind people&#8212;and this is what we do with our organizing&#8212;is that we have it within our power to change these things. I just came from New Mexico, and you know, we have now a Latina governor, Susana Martinez, very conservative. But good news for everybody&#8212;even though she had her agenda, very anti-immigrant agenda, taking away driver&#8217;s licenses from people who were undocumented&#8212;the state Senate of New Mexico stopped her in her tracks, and she couldn&#8217;t get her agenda through the Legislature. So there&#8217;s some glimmers of hope out there.</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: You know, I want to end this on a note of hope about older people; you know, it happens that as we&#8217;re recording this, I&#8217;m experiencing my 75th birthday. And I&#8217;ve known you guys for a long time; I remember going back to those early rallies, and so forth, when I was editing Ramparts magazine. And 75 years ago my father lost his job&#8212;the day I was born, had to tell my mother that&#8212;didn&#8217;t get it back for four years; they were both garment workers. And when you mentioned the Triangle disaster&#8212;my parents talked about it all the time, and unions were the basis of our life. And ironically, if you read Ronald Reagan&#8217;s own autobiography, he&#8217;ll tell you Roosevelt was, you know, a god in their family&#8217;s house; his father went to work for the New Deal. And without the New Deal, Ronald Reagan, of all people, said his family would have starved. And I think some of us old-timers have to remind people that it was, as you said before, unions that gave this country the gift of the middle class that is the basis of democracy. So do you guys have a last, positive word? I know you always do. Paul?</p> \n\n<p>Paul Schrade: Well, it&#8217;s good to be with the Scheer family, and happy birthday!</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: [Laughs] OK! And Dolores?</p> \n\n<p>Dolores Huerta: Well &#8230; thank you for your great light of journalism; you were a light back there in the &#8217;60s, when everything seemed so dark, and to know that your light is still shining&#8212;and also that you have, I guess, your son following in your footsteps&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: Yeah &#8230; all three of them, all three of them.</p> \n\n<p>Dolores Huerta: &#8230; so that more people can hear the way that you really interpret what&#8217;s happening in our world for the rest of us. And happy birthday, also!</p> \n\n<p>Robert Scheer: OK. Great, guys, thanks.</p> \n\n<p>Dolores Huerta: Si se puede!</p> \n\n<p>Peter Scheer: That&#8217;s it for this special edition of Truthdig Radio from KPFK Los Angeles.

One of the biggest players is Casey's General Stores , which focuses on building clusters of stores in small-town America. The company is based in Iowa and got its start in the Midwest, but it is moving to both the South and East rapidly.</p> \n\n<p>While some might think of this as a relatively boring industry, Casey's focus on becoming one of the biggest pizza companies in the country has gotten investors excited lately. Shares have tripled over the past five years, and the bump in the company's \"food and fountain\" comparable-store sales (comps) is one of the biggest reasons.</p> \n\n<p>The thesis for investors is simple: People go to Casey's to get their (low-margin) gas, but as they go inside, they buy more groceries, cigarettes, and most importantly (high-margin) prepared foods -- with pizza being the primary food that's bought. While gas might make up the bulk of revenue, it's things that are bought inside the store that contribute the most gross profit dollars.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/pie-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;amp;utm_campaign=pie_chart\" type=\"external\">Create pie charts Opens a New Window.</a></p> \n\n<p>The company has done a fantastic job of capitalizing on this opportunity, and should be lauded for seeing a niche that was underserved. Investors, however, need to be careful about management overpromising and underdelivering. That's what happened this year, and it seems like the table is set for it to happen again. Casey's reported Q4 2016 results Monday and held a conference call with analysts Tuesday morning.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Data source: SEC filings and Casey's General Stores investor relations.</p> \n\n<p>When it comes to convenience stores, investors shouldn't pay too much attention to revenue numbers. That's because the price of gas can fluctuate widely, and management has little control over this. Like you saw above, it also is a very low-margin aspect of the business.</p> \n\n<p>One year ago, management set out goals for the company's comps and margins in its three main categories. As you can see below, they met almost all of those, with one very notable exception.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://charts.infogr.am/column-chart?utm_source=embed_bottom&amp;amp;utm_medium=seo&amp;amp;utm_campaign=column_chart\" type=\"external\">Create column charts Opens a New Window.</a></p> \n\n<p>It is the shortfall in food and fountain that I find the most concerning. This is the central thesis to an investment in Casey's.</p> \n\n<p>No doubt, any company would die for comps above 5% in any category. But the assumption of double-digit comp growth in prepared foods is already baked into Casey's stock price -- and if the company continues to fall short of these projections, investors will pay the price.</p> \n\n<p>Management continually stated during the conference call that the reason for the shortfall was simply because the rollout of many growth initiatives -- a mobile food ordering app, 24-hour service, pizza delivery, and major remodels -- were weighted heavily toward the fourth quarter.</p> \n\n<p>But even then, comps during the fourth quarter were 8.2% -- well short of the 10.4% management foresaw for the year. That should give investors pause.</p> \n\n<p>It's also worth noting that the company either built or acquired 56 new stores during the fiscal year, but this fell well short of the 75-113 new locations that management said it would accomplish during the past 12 months.</p> \n\n<p>When management released its outlook for fiscal 2017, it said that it expected food and fountain to grow by 10.2% -- basically the same outlook it gave last year. Given the company's failure to live up to expectations in 2016, analysts were surprised.</p> \n\n<p>When pressed by analysts as to why the company would give such a high estimate, CEO Terry Handly said that the company was confident that the aforementioned growth initiatives could help get comps \"back in the double-digit area\" and that they are \"cautiously optimistic.\"</p> \n\n<p>Cautiously optimistic? That struck me as an odd way to put it. After falling 20% short of its comp growth and then restating the same goals for the current year, I would classify that goal as overly optimistic.</p> \n\n<p>It's also worth mentioning that a number of analysts questioned whether Hy-Vee's new convenience stores -- which are usually placed in front of their namesake grocery stores and offer prepared food as well -- were becoming a serious competitor. Management said they were a competitor, but left it at that.</p> \n\n<p>Given the nearly 5% sell-off in the stock as of 1:45 p.m. Tuesday, the market has concerns as well. Management made clear that the pace of store openings will accelerate in the coming year. That's a good move, as the company wants to establish itself in new markets it thinks it can exploit.</p> \n\n<p>Currently, the company trades for 21 times trailing earnings and 20 times 2017's expected earnings. That's not overly expensive or cheap, but I believe the performance of the company's food and fountain comps will be the primary determinant of where the stock heads over the next 12 months.</p> \n\n<p>The article <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/06/07/where-caseys-general-stores-inc-fell-short.aspx\" type=\"external\">Where Casey's General Stores Inc.

With each anniversary, the steps crumble beneath our feet, the stones ever more cracked, the sand ever finer. Five years of catastrophe in Iraq and I think of Churchill, who in the end called Palestine a &#8220;hell-disaster&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>But we have used these parallels before and they have drifted away in the Tigris breeze.

How did the people &#8212; the senatus populusque Romanus of our modern world &#8212; not rise up in rebellion when told the lies about weapons of mass destruction, about Saddam&#8217;s links with Osama bin Laden and 11 September?

Our predicament in Iraq is on an infinitely more terrible scale.</p> \n\n<p>As the Americans came storming up Iraq in 2003, their cruise missiles hissing through the sandstorm towards a hundred Iraqi towns and cities, I would sit in my filthy room in the Baghdad Palestine Hotel, unable to sleep for the thunder of explosions, and root through the books I&#8217;d brought to fill the dark, dangerous hours. Tolstoy&#8217;s War and Peace reminded me how conflict can be described with sensitivity and grace and horror &#8212; I recommend the Battle of Borodino &#8212; along with a file of newspaper clippings. In this little folder, there was a long rant by Pat Buchanan, written five months earlier; and still, today I feel its power and its prescience and its absolute historical honesty: &#8220;With our MacArthur Regency in Baghdad, Pax Americana will reach apogee. But then the tide recedes, for the one endeavour at which Islamic people excel is expelling imperial powers by terror or guerrilla war.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;They drove the Brits out of Palestine and Aden, the French out of Algeria, the Russians out of Afghanistan, the Americans out of Somalia and Beirut, the Israelis out of Lebanon. We have started up the road to empire and over the next hill we will meet those who went before. The only lesson we learn from history is that we do not learn from history.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>How easily the little men took us into the inferno, with no knowledge or, at least, interest in history. None of them read of the 1920 Iraqi insurgency against British occupation, nor of Churchill&#8217;s brusque and brutal settlement of Iraq the following year.</p> \n\n<p>On our historical radars, not even Crassus appeared, the wealthiest Roman general of all, who demanded an emperorship after conquering Macedonia &#8212; &#8220;Mission Accomplished&#8221; &#8212; and vengefully set forth to destroy Mesopotamia. At a spot in the desert near the Euphrates river, the Parthians &#8212; ancestors of present day Iraqi insurgents &#8212; annihilated the legions, chopped off Crassus&#8217;s head and sent it back to Rome filled with gold. Today, they would have videotaped his beheading.</p> \n\n<p>To their monumental hubris, these little men who took us to war five years ago now prove that they have learnt nothing. Anthony Blair &#8212; as we should always have called this small town lawyer &#8212; should be facing trial for his mendacity. Instead, he now presumes to bring peace to an Arab-Israeli conflict which he has done so much to exacerbate. And now we have the man who changed his mind on the legality of war &#8212; and did so on a single sheet of A4 paper &#8212; daring to suggest that we should test immigrants for British citizenship. Question 1, I contend, should be: Which blood-soaked British attorney general helped to send 176 British soldiers to their deaths for a lie? Question 2: How did he get away with it?</p> \n\n<p>But in a sense, the facile, dumbo nature of Lord Goldsmith&#8217;s proposal is a clue to the whole transitory, cardboard structure of our decision-making. The great issues that face us &#8212; be they Iraq or Afghanistan, the US economy or global warming, planned invasions or &#8220;terrorism&#8221; &#8212; are discussed not according to serious political timetables but around television schedules and press conferences.</p> \n\n<p>Will the first air raids on Iraq hit prime-time television in the States? Mercifully, yes. Will the first US troops in Baghdad appear on the breakfast shows? Of course. Will Saddam&#8217;s capture be announced by Bush and Blair simultaneously?</p> \n\n<p>But this is all part of the problem. True, Churchill and Roosevelt argued about the timing of the announcement that war in Europe had ended. And it was the Russians who pipped them to the post. But we told the truth. When the British were retreating to Dunkirk, Churchill announced that the Germans had &#8220;penetrated deeply and spread alarm and confusion in their tracks&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>Why didn&#8217;t Bush or Blair tell us this when the Iraqi insurgents began to assault the Western occupation forces? Well, they were too busy telling us that things were getting better, that the rebels were mere &#8220;dead-enders&#8221;.</p> \n\n<p>On 17 June 1940, Churchill told the people of Britain: &#8220;The news from France is very bad and I grieve for the gallant French people who have fallen into this terrible misfortune.&#8221; Why didn&#8217;t Blair or Bush tell us that the news from Iraq was very bad and that they grieved &#8212; even just a few tears for a minute or so &#8212; for the Iraqis?</p> \n\n<p>For these were the men who had the temerity, the sheer, unadulterated gall, to dress themselves up as Churchill, heroes who would stage a rerun of the Second World War, the BBC dutifully calling the invaders &#8220;the Allies&#8221; &#8212; they did, by the way &#8212; and painting Saddam&#8217;s regime as the Third Reich.</p> \n\n<p>Of course, when I was at school, our leaders &#8212; Attlee, Churchill, Eden, Macmillan, or Truman, Eisenhower and Kennedy in the United States &#8212; had real experience of real war. Not a single Western leader today has any first-hand experience of conflict. When the Anglo-American invasion of Iraq began, the most prominent European opponent of the war was Jacques Chirac, who fought in the Algerian conflict. But he has now gone. So has Colin Powell, a Vietnam veteran but himself duped by Rumsfeld and the CIA.</p> \n\n<p>Yet one of the terrible ironies of our times is that the most bloodthirsty of American statesmen &#8212; Bush and Cheney, Rumsfeld and Wolfovitz &#8212; have either never heard a shot fired in anger or have ensured they did not have to fight for their country when they had the chance to do so. No wonder Hollywood titles like &#8220;Shock and Awe&#8221; appeal to the White House. Movies are their only experience of human conflict; the same goes for Blair and Brown.</p> \n\n<p>Churchill had to account for the loss of Singapore before a packed House. Brown won&#8217;t even account for Iraq until the war is over.</p> \n\n<p>It is a grotesque truism that today &#8212; after all the posturing of our political midgets five years ago &#8212; we might at last be permitted a valid seance with the ghosts of the Second World War. Statistics are the medium, and the room would have to be dark. But it is a fact that the total of US dead in Iraq (3,978) is well over the number of American casualties suffered in the initial D-Day landings at Normandy (3,384 killed and missing) on 6 June, 1944, or more than three times the total British casualties at Arnhem the same year (1,200).</p> \n\n<p>They count for just over a third of the total fatalities (11,014) of the entire British Expeditionary Force from the German invasion of Belgium to the final evacuation at Dunkirk in June 1940. The number of British dead in Iraq &#8212; 176 &#8212; is almost equal to the total of UK forces lost at the Battle of the Bulge in 1944-45 (just over 200). The number of US wounded in Iraq &#8212; 29,395 &#8212; is more than nine times the number of Americans injured on 6 June (3,184) and more than a quarter of the tally for US wounded in the entire 1950-53 Korean war (103,284).</p> \n\n<p>Iraqi casualties allow an even closer comparison to the Second World War. Even if we accept the lowest of fatality statistics for civilian dead &#8212; they range from 350,000 up to a million &#8212; these long ago dwarfed the number of British civilian dead in the flying-bomb blitz on London in 1944-45 (6,000) and now far outnumber the total figure for civilians killed in bombing raids across the United Kingdom &#8212; 60,595 dead, 86,182 seriously wounded &#8212; from 1940 to 1945.</p> \n\n<p>Indeed, the Iraqi civilian death toll since our invasion is now greater than the total number of British military fatalities in the Second World War, which came to an astounding 265,000 dead (some histories give this figure as 300,000) and 277,000 wounded. Minimum estimates for Iraqi dead mean that the civilians of Mesopotamia have suffered six or seven Dresdens or &#8212; more terrible still &#8212; two Hiroshimas.</p> \n\n<p>Yet in a sense, all this is a distraction from the awful truth in Buchanan&#8217;s warning. We have dispatched our armies into the land of Islam. We have done so with the sole encouragement of Israel, whose own false intelligence over Iraq has been discreetly forgotten by our masters, while weeping crocodile tears for the hundreds of thousands of Iraqis who have died.</p> \n\n<p>America&#8217;s massive military prestige has been irreparably diminished. And if there are, as I now calculate, 22 times as many Western troops in the Muslim world as there were at the time of the 11th and 12th century Crusades, we must ask what we are doing. Are we there for oil? For democracy? For Israel? For fear of weapons of mass destruction? Or for fear of Islam?</p> \n\n<p>We blithely connect Afghanistan to Iraq. If only Washington had not become distracted by Iraq, so the narrative now goes, the Taliban could not have re-established themselves. But al-Qa&#8217;ida and the nebulous Osama bin Laden were not distracted. Which is why they expanded their operations into Iraq and then used this experience to assault the West in Afghanistan with the hitherto &#8212; in Afghanistan &#8212; unheard of suicide bomber.</p> \n\n<p>And I will hazard a terrible guess: that we have lost Afghanistan as surely as we have lost Iraq and as surely as we are going to &#8220;lose&#8221; Pakistan. It is our presence, our power, our arrogance, our refusal to learn from history and our terror &#8212; yes, our terror &#8212; of Islam that is leading us into the abyss. And until we learn to leave these Muslim peoples alone, our catastrophe in the Middle East will only become graver. There is no connection between Islam and &#8220;terror&#8221;. But there is a connection between our occupation of Muslim lands and &#8220;terror&#8221;. It&#8217;s not too complicated an equation. And we don&#8217;t need a public inquiry to get it right.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "The Only Lesson We Ever Learn Is That We Never Learn", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/the-only-lesson-we-ever-learn-is-that-we-never-learn/", "published_at": "2008-03-19", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>In the twelve-course meal that is the war in Iraq, America has just been served the first entree. The fight with Iraq&#8217;s state armed forces was merely the amuse-bouche. The subsequent guerilla war with the Baath, as distasteful as we found it, was still just the appetizer. Over the past two weeks, we have been presented with the first of the main courses, Fourth Generation war waged for religion. If, as is traditional, this is the fish course, our reaction suggests it is flounder.</p> \n\n<p>Frankly, I was surprised how quickly this dish arrived. It seems Mohammed&#8217;s kitchen is working rather more speedily than usual. While a broadening and intensifying of the anti-American resistance was inevitable, I did not think it would reach its present intensity until this summer. The fact that is has erupted so early has political as well as military implications. The full scope of our disaster in Syracuse&#8211;er, sorry, Iraq&#8211;may be evident before the party conventions, as well as prior to the fall election. Might Bush do an LBJ and choose not to run? Will a Kerry who voted for the war be a credible nominee? Military disaster can displace all sorts of certainties.</p> \n\n<p>It is not yet a disaster, some may say. On the tactical level, that is true, although it may not be true much longer. But on the strategic level it is not just one disaster, it is four:</p> \n\n<p>* * *</p> \n\n<p>The pretense that we came to &#8220;liberate&#8221; the Iraqi people and not as conquerors is no longer credible. Faced with a popular uprising, we effectively declared war on the people of Iraq. The overall American commander, General Abizaid, &#8220;gave a stark warning for the Iraqi fighters, from the minority Sunni as well as the majority Shiite populations,&#8221; according to the Cleveland Plain Dealer. &#8220;&#8216;First, we are going to win,&#8217; Abizaid said, seated at a table in a marbled palace hall&#8230;&#8217;Secondly, everyone needs to understand that there is no more powerful force assembled on Earth than this military force in this country&#8230;'&#8221; That is the language of conquest, not liberation, and it destroys the legitimacy of America&#8217;s presence in Iraq, both locally and around the world.</p> \n\n<p>* * *</p> \n\n<p>We have now picked a fight with the Shiites, who control our lines of communication and who make up a majority of the Iraqi population. I thought that even the Valley of the Blind that is the CPA would have better sense than to make this final, fatal strategic blunder, but it seems they can always find a new ditch to stumble into. We did it over the utterly trivial matter of Muqtada al-Sadr&#8217;s newspaper printing lies&#8211;this from an American administration that long ago won the Order of Pinocchio, First Class, with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds. While many Iraqi Shiites don&#8217;t much like al-Sadr, they like seeing Americans kill fellow Shiites even less.</p> \n\n<p>* * *</p> \n\n<p>The Marines threw away the opportunity to de-escalate the fighting with the Sunnis in Fallujah and instead have raised the intensity of anti-Americanism there. For months, the Marines trained for de-escalation. But because of one minor incident of barely tactical importance, the killing of four American contractors, the de-escalation strategy was thrown out the window and replaced by an all-out assault on an Iraqi city. The Marines may have been given no choice by the White House, but it also looks as if their own training did not go very deep; the Plain Dealer quoted a Marine battalion commander in Fallujah as saying, &#8220;What is coming is the destruction of anti-coalition forces in Fallujah. They have two choices: Submit or die.&#8221; That is hardly the language of de-escalation.</p> \n\n<p>* * *</p> \n\n<p>Finally, our whole &#8220;say good-bye at the end of June&#8221; strategy depends on the reliability of the Iraqi security forces we have been busy creating. But when faced with fighting their own people on behalf of Christian foreigners, most of them went over or went home. This was utterly predictable, but its effect is to leave us without any exit strategy at all.</p> \n\n<p>So what comes next? The current violence may follow a sine wave, ebbing and then flowing again, with the whole curve gradually trending up. Or, it may rise in a linear, accelerating curve, in which case we will soon be driven out of Iraq, possibly in a full-scale sauve que peut rout. The former appears more likely, but it still leads to the same ending, if taking a bit more time to get there. Unlike traditional twelve-course dinners, this one does not finish with a dessert or a savoury. It ends, to borrow one of John Boyd&#8217;s favorite phrases, with the &#8220;coalition&#8221; getting the whole enchilada right up the p&#8212; chute.

Is it really comparable to Lockheed Martin's F-35? IMAGE SOURCE: <a href=\"http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:FA-18F_Super_Hornet_Jolly_Rogers_edit_1.jpg\" type=\"external\">U.S. NAVY Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>As a negotiating tactic, the effort has merit. It embarrasses the president-elect's negotiating partners and gives them incentive to offer concessions, without requiring Trump and the taxpayers he will soon represent to make any concessions of their own. But in his latest social media salvo, President-elect Trump may have gone a bit too far.</p> \n\n<p>Last week, the soon-to-be-president challenged Boeing to produce \"a comparable F-18 Super Hornet\" at a price better than Lockheed Martin's F-35 -- which is curious. There is no such thing as a fourth-generation F -18 Super Hornet from Boeing that is comparable to a fifth-generation F-35 Lightning II from Lockheed.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>True, from a cosmetic viewpoint, both Boeing's F/A-18 and Lockheed's F-35 are fighter jets. Both planes have two wings, two vertical stabilizers and... fly. But that's about where the similarities end.</p> \n\n<p>Boeing's F/A-18 is a <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/06/30/boeings-fighter-jets-are-doomed-and-thats-ok.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">fourth-generation warbird Opens a New Window.</a>, designed for an era in which the U.S. would command air superiority from the get-go in almost any conflict. It operates at a quick tempo, picking up bombs and missiles from an aircraft carrier and delivering them to a target, with quick turnaround times. The F/A-18 doesn't worry about stealth, because it ain't got time for that -- it's got bombs to drop! But if you light up an F/A-18 with radar, it looks exactly like what it is -- a fighter jet -- and is relatively easy to track and target.</p> \n\n<p>Lockheed Martin's F-35, on the other hand, is a <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/05/08/did-lockheed-martins-f-35-stealth-fighter-just-get.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">fifth-generation fighter Opens a New Window.</a>, designed to combat advanced 21st-century opponents possessing robust air defenses. The F-35's radar absorbing skin and curious configuration make it invisible to radar. While certain very-high-frequency radars <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2014/10/19/did-china-just-render-americas-1-trillion-stealth.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">may be able to detect it Opens a New Window.</a>, the plane's radar cross-section on fire control radars is similar in size to a golf ball -- too small for fire control radar to lock onto it and guide a missile all the way to contact.</p> \n\n<p>Simply put, an F-35 is designed to survive threats that would take down an F/A-18. Thus, in modern warfare, F-35s would be deployed first to penetrate and take down an adversary's air defenses, after which the F/A-18s would swoop in to finish the job. The planes are thus complementary, not comparable.</p> \n\n<p>So is Donald Trump completely off his rocker? And if he isn't, what might Trump's F-35 tweet mean for Boeing and Lockheed Martin, and for their investors?</p> \n\n<p>Here's my take: The president-elect cannot be off his rocker, because the differences between Boeing's F/A-18 and Lockheed Martin's F-35 are too glaringly obvious for anyone to make a mistake this big, and this publicly. In addition to the differences noted, the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps are currently the only services using Boeing's F/A-18, so the plane could not possibly be used to replace the <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/08/07/lockheed-martins-f-35b-stealth-fighter-wins-a-rare.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">1,750-odd F-35A stealth fighters Opens a New Window.</a> that the Air Force plans to buy -- just the 520 or so F-35-Bs and -Cs on order by the <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/02/22/us-navy-to-lockheed-martins-f-35-stealth-fighter-w.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Navy and Marines Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Of course, the president-elect couldn't go into all of these details in a 140-character tweet. But what might he have said if he had a bit more room to expand on his idea of a comparable F-18 Super Hornet, and what would the implications be then for investors?</p> \n\n<p>There are a couple of possibilities. For one, Boeing has for some years been working on design changes to the F/A-18 that the company contends would make it stealth-like -- if not completely stealthy. While Lockheed Martin would argue this is not comparable to its F-35, Trump may argue that Boeing's improvements are good enough to compete with the F-35 -- at the right price.</p> \n\n<p>Alternatively, Trump may be referring back to Boeing's X-32 aircraft, the stealth fighter Boeing entered in <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/news/2001/lmt011029.htm?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">the Joint Strike Fighter competition back in 2001 Opens a New Window.</a> -- the plane that ultimately lost to Lockheed Martin's F-35.</p> \n\n<p>As you recall, back then, the Pentagon had asked both companies to bid a plane they thought they could build for <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/05/08/did-lockheed-martins-f-35-stealth-fighter-just-get.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">about $35 million a copy Opens a New Window.</a> (in 1994 dollars).

But if Boeing could dust off its plans for the X-32 and build the Air Force a stealthy fighter for something closer to the original asking price, that might be something that would interest Trump -- and Boeing -- very much. Thirty-five million dollars in 1994 dollars would be $57 million today, or about half the price that Lockheed is charging for the F-35. Granted, it would take Boeing significant investment to update its 2001 design and bid a new price on such a comparable F-18 (i.e., the X-32).</p> \n\n<p>But with the prospect of reintroducing competition to the fighter jet industry, and potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in Pentagon contracts at stake, Boeing just might bite.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than Boeing When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That hefty sum was reportedly in addition to the $7,000 the couple paid the government earlier this month.</p> \n\n<p>The dispute between the Kleins and Laurel and Rachel Bowman-Cryer, the lesbian couple who filed the complaint, began back in January of 2013.

The White House says Weinstein and Giovanni Lo Porto, an Italian held by the terror organization since 2012, were inadvertently killed during U.S. counterterrorism operations in a border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan in January 2015.

Austin Associates, a U.S. firm advising Pakistani businesses and government under contract with the U.S. Agency for International Development. His wife said he \"loved and respected the Pakistani people and their culture.\"</p> \n\n<p>He was kidnapped from his house in Lahore in August 2011.</p> \n\n<p>Videos of Weinstein appealing for help appeared in 2012 and 2013. In a video sent to reporters in December 2013, Weinstein, bearded and haggard-looking, appealed to President Barack Obama to negotiate his release.

The FBI described Gadahn as 5-foot-11, a little more than 200 pounds, with brown hair and scars on his chest and right forearm.</p> \n\n<p>Some tidbits about his work for al-Qaida surfaced in documents leaked by former National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>The documents show that bin Laden's inner circle was frustrated in 2010 that attention in the U.S. had shifted to the economic downturn without linking al-Qaida to the damage. \"All the political talk in America is about the economy, forgetting or ignoring the war and its role in weakening the economy,\" Gadahn wrote.</p> \n\n<p>The papers also showed that Gadahn studied U.S. media, advising that CNN was too close to the government and heaping scorn on Fox News which \"falls into the abyss, as you know, and lacks neutrality.\"</p> \n\n<p>The government said he was killed in a separate drone strike from the one that killed the two hostages and another American tied to al-Qaida.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>AHMED FAROUQ</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Farouq was an American who became an al-Qaida leader in Pakistan, the White House says.</p> \n\n<p>He had assumed the title of deputy emir of al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent, and was involved in planning terrorist attacks, according to a U.S. official, who said Farouq had dual U.S.-Pakistani citizenship.</p> \n\n<p>The al-Qaida offshoot claimed responsibility for a failed attempt last year to hijack Pakistani naval vessels and use them to attack U.S. warships.</p> \n\n<p>Farouq was considered an up-and-coming leader within the group, according to the terror-tracking website Long War Journal, which cited correspondence recovered from bin Laden's compound and released in a Brooklyn terror trial.</p> \n\n<p>In a 2010 letter to bin Laden, al-Qaida's general manager at the time, Atiyah Abd al Rahman, said Farouq knew Arabic well, had management skills, was cultured and possessed a strong will.

Five rapes, three assaults, a pair of extortions, blackmail, an attempted murder, violence against police and a robbery made up Springare&#8217;s caseload for a five-day period earlier this month, according to a Feb. 3 Facebook post he wrote. The suspects were all from Muslim-majority countries &#8211; Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Somalia and Turkey &#8211; save for one Swedish man nabbed in a drug-related case.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&#8220;Mohammed, Mahmod, Ali, again and again,&#8221; Springare wrote of those arrested.</p> \n\n<p>Springare, who was briefly investigated for possible hate crime incitement based on his post, managed to elucidate what Trump only hinted at during a Florida campaign speech &#8211; somewhat opaquely.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&#8230;Last month, the police chief for the southern Swedish city of Malmo issued a desperate plea for help curtailing a plague of attempted murders, beatings and rapes. About 32 percent of Malmo&#8217;s occupants are migrants, although it is not clear what role migrants play in the crime wave.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We cannot do it on our own,&#8221; Chief Stefan Sinteus wrote in an open letter about the &#8220;upward spiral of violence.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>And Sinteus is not merely dealing with typical crimes that any modern city would witness.</p> \n\n<p>Malmo had 52 hand grenade attacks in 2016 alone, a jump from 48 attacks in 2015, according to figures provided by the Swedish Police Authority.</p> \n\n<p>Nationwide, the terror threat level is at &#8220;elevated&#8221; and police believe at least 300 Swedish nationals have travelled to Syria and Iraq for jihadi training. On Feb. 11, a Swedish man and a Danish man were arrested in Turkey, suspected of plotting to carry out attacks in Europe. Tofik Saleh, a 38-year-old Swedish citizen of Iraqi origin, had been training with ISIS since 2014, officials said.</p> \n\n<p>The left can&#8217;t respond to any of this.

No problem.</p> \n\n<p>After a tumultuous year of surreal corruption scandals involving exotic horses and the jailed billionaire scion and one of the most embarrassing recalls in the consumer electronics history, Samsung stunned investors with another improbable record: the South Korean tech giant may have earned more than Apple and ended Intel's quarter century dominance in the semiconductor industry.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Seemingly invincible Samsung Electronics appears set to log record annual profit this year as exploding use of data in mobile devices and the \"memory supercycle\" help it surmount the jailing of its de facto leader and sidestep losses from its fire-prone Galaxy Note 7s.</p> \n\n<p>South Korea's largest company reported Thursday record high quarterly profit and sales that likely will help it nudge aside Intel as the leading maker of semiconductors.</p> \n\n<p>Samsung also likely outstripped Apple in quarterly earnings for the first time as soaring use of connected devices and mobile data fueled demand for computer chips.</p> \n\n<p>Samsung's bottom line is better than ever, even with its vice chairman and de facto chief Lee Jae-yong jailed as part of a corruption scandal that unseated former South Korean president, Park Geun-hye.</p> \n\n<p>While Lee and Park battle allegations of bribery and other charges, Samsung is thriving thanks to tiny microchips called DRAM and NAND memory chips, which are needed to store and process data in servers and mobile devices.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Companies are adding server memory capacity to expand new server platforms and cloud services and handle artificial intelligence and other emerging services. Hardware manufacturers will likely increase orders of memory chips for smartphones as they launch new models later this year. Consumers also expect their handsets to be packed with higher memory storage, which increases memory demand.</p> \n\n<p>The unprecedented boom in the memory chip industry dubbed the \"memory super cycle\" helped push Samsung's April-June net income to 10.8 trillion won ($9.7 billion), up 85 percent from 5.8 trillion won a year earlier.</p> \n\n<p>Analysts had forecast 10.1 trillion won in net profit according to FactSet, a financial data provider.</p> \n\n<p>Operating profit jumped 73 percent over a year earlier to 14.1 trillion won ($12.7 billion) while sales rose 20 percent to 61 trillion won ($54.8 billion), in line with Samsung's earlier guidance.</p> \n\n<p>Despite relatively slow demand for smartphones and TVs, increased use of connected devices and mobile data is driving demand for server memory to store, analyze and process data. Memory chip prices have soared thanks to tight supply conditions, bringing unprecedented profitability to both Samsung and South Korea's No. 2 chip manufacturer, SK Hynix.</p> \n\n<p>Nearly 60 percent of Samsung's quarterly income was generated by its semiconductor division, which booked a record operating income of 8 trillion won ($7.2 billion) on sales of 17.6 trillion won ($15.8 billion).</p> \n\n<p>Samsung's other components business, which makes high-end display panels called OLED for smartphones, also saw solid gains in earnings after this spring's launch of new Samsung Galaxy smartphones using the advanced displays.</p> \n\n<p>The Galaxy S8 series of smartphones recorded higher sales than their predecessors, helping the company's mobile business rebound from last year's crisis over Galaxy Note 7s that had to be recalled and eventually discontinued because they tended to overheat or catch fire. That fiasco cost Samsung more than $5 billion last year.</p> \n\n<p>Samsung said its mobile business logged 4.1 trillion won ($3.7 billion) in operating profit. That is slightly lower than its year-earlier result due to higher component prices but nearly double the previous quarter's income</p> \n\n<p>The good times for Samsung appear likely to put it ahead of its rivals.</p> \n\n<p>Apple is forecast to report $8.2 billion in quarterly net profit when its financial results are disclosed on Tuesday, according to FactSet. April-June is typically a slow season for Apple.</p> \n\n<p>Intel, due to report its earnings later Thursday, is expected to book $14.4 billion in quarterly revenue.</p> \n\n<p>Looking ahead, Samsung said its third quarter profit may take a hit from marketing expenses from its upcoming launch in its new Galaxy Note series smartphone.</p> \n\n<p>But it still has a good chance of reporting its biggest annual earnings in its history this year.</p> \n\n<p>The outlook for semiconductor demand is robust and the overall profit during the second half will grow thanks to memory chips and its OLED screens, Samsung predicted.</p> \n\n<p>In the meantime, Samsung has largely insulated its day-to-day operations from Lee's legal troubles, though the longer term implications for Samsung's leadership remain unclear.</p> \n\n<p>Both Lee and Park have denied wrongdoing.

Most of the time, at least.</p> \n\n<p>When an affluent voter in a high tax bracket who owns a business and a nice house shows up and votes for a Republican, that is a rational decision. And when a lower-income voter who has little access to health care and pays rent to a landlord shows up to vote for a Democrat, that is also a rational decision.</p> \n\n<p>And for most of the population in most of the country, this is still how votes for the two parties break down: more affluent voters pull the lever for Republicans and less affluent voters do so for Democrats.</p> \n\n<p>If every adult living in the United States turned out to vote on every Election Day, and was forced to choose only between the two parties, it is almost certain that the Republican Party in its current form would lose not only the presidency but every state legislature and congressional race.</p> \n\n<p>The problem though is that <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/income-gap-at-the-polls-113997\" type=\"external\">affluent people show up</a> on Election Day with a lot more frequency than the less affluent. The Republican-backed voter suppression laws have had a huge effect. But this predates that. Over the years the policy preferences of voters and nonvoters have diverged sharply, particularly when it comes to class-based issues. Voters are far more conservative when it comes to things like the welfare state, wealth inequality, and labor unions than nonvoters are. So if more of these nonvoters began to show up at the polls, we would suddenly have an electorate dramatically more supportive of the kind of social-democratic program favored by Sanders and his supporters.</p> \n\n<p>One explanation could be that the affluent party, the GOP, is much better and more consistent at rewarding electoral loyalty to their constituents through concrete, material economic policy than the less affluent party, the Democrats, is for their lower-income constituency. When George W. Bush took power, he delivered to his constituency immediately: capital gains and top marginal tax rates were slashed and the Department of Labor was gutted, making it harder for his voters&#8217; employees to check their bosses&#8217; power. More than sweet promises and a dozen roses once a year, the GOP put a ring on it.</p> \n\n<p>But when Obama took power, he passed the Heritage Foundation&#8217;s <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">health-care plan</a> and dropped organized labor&#8217;s central priority &#8212; the Employee Free Choice Act &#8212; even as he oversaw the Democratic Party&#8217;s greatest congressional majority in years. Regardless of whatever constraints he had and the small but real victories his administration offered for workers (Medicaid expansion, the overtime rule, etc.) it&#8217;s just true that his Republican predecessor delivered more to his affluent voters, and more quickly, than Obama did to his less affluent voters.</p> \n\n<p>The Republican Party is simply better at being a party of capital than the Democratic Party is at being a party of the working classes. And it&#8217;s not an accident.</p> \n\n<p>Last week, Seth Ackerman <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">wrote a piece</a> pushing back on <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/10/15/13286498/donald-trump-voters-race-economic-anxiety\" type=\"external\">Vox&#8217;s study</a> of lower-income Trump voters. He ended that essay with a pretty undeniable fact: despite all the talk of a GOP in decline, they control Congress and the vast majority of state governments. The party that had been beaten back into the minority for most of the twentieth century now, in the 2010s, can not only obstruct but govern. And perhaps one reason they&#8217;re able to have that power is due to the fact that there is a massive, untapped portion of the electorate &#8212; downscale whites&amp;#160; &#8212; who <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">just don&#8217;t vote</a> anymore.</p> \n\n<p>While we hear constantly that they&#8217;re demographically dying out, white workers without a college degree remain at least 63 percent of the working class and in twenty years, will be a &#8220;mere&#8221; 49.5 percent. That&#8217;s a ton of potential voters. Ackerman&#8217;s argument was that instead of writing off lower-income Trump supporters as hopeless racists who&#8217;ll always vote for white supremacy over their wallets, we should instead attempt to forge a broad, working-class political program that could win them over.</p> \n\n<p>Pretty quickly, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/789175810015932416\" type=\"external\">pundits</a> had a collective brain melt. How dare we argue that the left-of-center party use a working-class program to appeal to these working-class bigots! In one illuminating discussion, I saw a high-profile political commentator state that this was a ridiculous strategy because the Democratic Party already gets the non-racist share of the white working class to show up. And that the only way these poorer whites would come to the table is if the Democratic Party promised to explicitly or implicitly protect white supremacy.</p> \n\n<p>The implication here is that the huge number of low-income whites who simply stay home on Election Day (or the much smaller number who pull the lever for the GOP) can only be operating &#8212; or failing to operate &#8212; out of racism.</p> \n\n<p>It was suddenly clear: the liberal commentators who hold this view believe that their party and&amp;#160;its&amp;#160;record on both campaigning on and enacting a working-class program was so obviously good that to be a worker and fail to vote for the Democratic Party must signal some greater, all-encompassing ideological drive that overpowered class interest.</p> \n\n<p>To this punditocracy, that overriding ideology that thwarts a vote for &#8220;the working-class party&#8221; must be white supremacy. And thus this huge chunk of downscale white voters who don&#8217;t vote at all (and the smaller chunk who vote GOP) would only change their behavior if the Democratic Party became a White Man&#8217;s Party in the old Dixiecrat mold or if they somehow, sitting in their homes, managed to overcome their racism through personal enlightenment.</p> \n\n<p>This couldn&#8217;t be farther from the truth.</p> \n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at McDowell County, West Virginia. The Guardian <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqceHviNBC4\" type=\"external\">zeroed in</a> on McDowell due to Trump winning 91.5 percent of the Republican primary vote. They of course left out the fact that more than three times as many Democratic Party ballots were cast and that nearly twice as many people voted for Sanders as voted for Trump &#8212; but we&#8217;ll give them a pass because at the time of the primary, the GOP race was effectively decided. Fair enough. McDowell County will likely go for Trump in November. Just as it did for Romney in 2012.</p> \n\n<p>And yet in 2008, Barack Obama won McDowell handily with 53 percent of the vote. Recent studies have shown that Obama won across the country in 2008 with <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/06/dems-need-better-answers-for-the-working-class.html\" type=\"external\">far more</a> white working-class voters than commonly thought. Even though he lost many of them four years later in 2012 &#8212; they either stayed home or went with Romney. Trump&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/20/upshot/the-new-blue-and-red-educational-split-is-replacing-the-culture-war.html\" type=\"external\">strength</a> in the Midwest this year appears to stem in part from white working-class ex-Obama voters. As one older, ex-mine worker in McDowell says to the Guardian, &#8220;I voted for that black guy two times.&#8221; He&#8217;s now with Trump.</p> \n\n<p>How does a liberal pundit explain this? If these voters are such obstinate racists who&#8217;ll always choose upholding &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; over their pocketbooks, why did they give Obama a shot in the first place? Did they think he wasn&#8217;t really black? Why didn&#8217;t they vote in 2008 like they did in 2012 and plan to in 2016? Did they simply expect Obama to help uphold white supremacy and, when he got into office, found that he acted &#8220;too radically for blackness&#8221;? Was inviting Jay-Z to the White House the moment where Obama lost the white working class forever?</p> \n\n<p>Or, perhaps, in the wake of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, Obama and his party simply <a href=\"http://theweek.com/articles/624777/obamas-biggest-failure\" type=\"external\">failed</a> to make the lives of voters in McDowell County substantially better. Since Obama, the Democrats have campaigned in every subsequent election under the galvanizing cry of &#8220;Hey, it <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">could&#8217;ve been worse</a>.&#8221; Maybe these McDowell voters question how it was that the wealthiest Americans recovered so quickly from the crash while they and their families and neighbors were worse off than ever.</p> \n\n<p>Is this really a crazy hypothesis? Staying home on Election Day or &#8212; in a two-party system &#8212; voting for &#8220;the other guys&#8221; is certainly something no left-of-center person wants to see. But it&#8217;s not an insane or necessarily ideological decision when your life has fallen apart during the eight years one particular party has held the White House. While Obama at least delivered Medicaid expansion to West Virginians, his presumptive successor campaigned on, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.&#8221; And while Clinton promised to enact programs to ease the loss of those livelihoods, Bill Clinton made similar promises about easing the job losses of NAFTA. To no one&#8217;s surprise, they didn&#8217;t materialize. I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s some <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">well-earned skepticism</a>.</p> \n\n<p>When it comes to the nature of the white working class, I agree with civil rights leader Bayard Rustin: they are neither inherently conservative nor liberal. Which way they break is determined by politics and organization &#8212; not destiny or their whiteness.</p> \n\n<p>Racism can be fought, defeated, or overruled by working-class politics. Or it can be brought front and center. As Ackerman pointed out in his article, West Virginia in the 1920s was a bastion of reaction &#8212; the KKK and coal operators <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">ran the state</a>. In the 1930s and up through the 1970s, it was a hotbed of labor unions, class struggle, and a hell of a lot of Democratic Party votes. Hubert Humphrey, who rose to prominence for his commitment to both civil rights and the welfare state, crushed Richard Nixon and George Wallace in West Virginia with 49.6 percent of the vote. Was this because the whites of West Virginia were simply less racist than the whites of Georgia, who helped Wallace carry their state? Or was it because West Virginia was the site of class struggle and labor politics in a way that Georgia at that time was not?</p> \n\n<p>In fact, the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">greatest determinant</a> of whether a white working-class person votes GOP or Democrat is still whether or not he or she is in a labor union. A union is, after all, an organization that, ideally, keeps its members focused on their material, class interests even between elections. They build solidarity between people who might otherwise dislike, distrust, or even hate each other. They keep working people focused on their inherent commonality in a way that no privilege-checking session, feel-good campaign ad, or BuzzFeed quiz ever can. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re powerful. And that&#8217;s why the rich despise them.</p> \n\n<p>And while labor-union membership has been in decline overall for decades now, the potential for workers to organize is as strong as ever &#8212; even under twenty-first-century capitalism. As sociologist Beverly Silver <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">has pointed out</a>, the spread of just-in-time production means a relatively small number of workers still &#8220;can bring an entire corporation to a standstill.&#8221; And even with globalization, &#8220;the potential geographical scale of the impacts of these stoppages has increased.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Even today strategies and technologies to diminish workers&#8217; rights in education and transportation have resulted in the first stirrings of union drives from charter school teachers and Uber drivers. As much as we hear otherwise, capitalism will always need workers to make their profits and will thus always be vulnerable to the potential of organized labor. That is the core truth of a capitalist economy that Marxists understand &#8212; no matter how zany we can get about other things &#8212; and that liberals do not.</p> \n\n<p>It also means we&#8217;re inoculated from other catechisms that bear no resemblance to the historical record. The belief that &#8220;racism&#8221; is a transhistorical phenomenon that can and will always destroy working-class solidarity is not only <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">wrong</a>, it fundamentally aligns &#8212; almost like an ideological partnership &#8212; with the same belief we hear in the press all the time that organized labor can only hope to manage its extinction and nothing more. And that the working classes are obsolete.</p> \n\n<p>Together, these beliefs &#8212; perpetual racism and the hopelessness of labor fighting back against capital &#8212; form a politics that is fundamentally conservative. And in this retreat from a politics of class solidarity and working-class self-determination, the professional classes have stepped in and taken the wheel.</p> \n\n<p>Today, the Democratic Party can count on the votes of millions of working-class Americans, largely people of color. And yet it&#8217;s an open secret that the party&#8217;s program is led by the affluent professional class at best and enlightened Silicon Valley billionaires at worst. Obama himself <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/06/barack-obama-venture-capitalist\" type=\"external\">has hinted</a> that he&#8217;s interested in going into venture capital after his presidency. Organized labor &#8212; always a junior partner in the Democratic Party even at its height &#8212; is now something closer to Donny in The Big Lebowski. Frail, meek and at death&#8217;s door, he must always &#8220;shut the fuck up.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>That means that while this form of liberal politics can probably scare up enough votes to win a few elections, it&#8217;s fundamentally incapable of not only governing but of changing society for the better. It surrenders Congress and the majority of state legislatures to the most fiendish right-wing maniacs in the country. And it&#8217;s a politics that&#8217;s fundamentally limited even in its ability to help fight racial discrimination.</p> \n\n<p>After all, the two most significant and expansive pieces of federal legislation on civil rights in the twentieth century were signed by two presidents who won the votes of the white working class &#8212; Harry Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson. And it was Walter Reuther&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.thekingcenter.org/archive/document/united-auto-workers-convention-speech\" type=\"external\">United Auto Workers</a> that provided financial support to Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement &#8212; not &#8220;woke&#8221; corporate executives.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s true that working-class politics has been torn apart by racial strife in the past but the opposite is equally true. Black and white workers in the Jim Crow South were able to organize unions together even if racist political appeals always had to be fought off. How strange it is to believe that a white forty-year-old worker in 2016 is just as much or more driven by racial animosity than his Southern 1937 Jim Crow equivalent. (A recent Reuters survey puts Trump&#8217;s support among non-college Southern whites at 55 percent for those over fifty years of age, but only 39 percent for those forty-nine and younger.) And as much as liberals like to point out that the supposed &#8220;bellwether&#8221; Macomb County, Michigan &#8212; the home of many unionized autoworkers &#8212; went for Nixon in 1968 and Reagan in 1980, it is equally true that they repeatedly reelected David Bonior, one of the most left-wing members of the House of Representatives. In 1976, even at the height of the busing riots, Carter won the county, just as he won the nation&#8217;s entire white working-class vote, North and South.</p> \n\n<p>Politics, especially working-class politics, is complicated. Well-funded reactionaries will always be able to find weak points in such a coalition. That doesn&#8217;t mean that &#8220;white supremacy&#8221; is destiny. In 1980, Reagan did in fact win working-class whites &#8212; but with the exception of black voters, he won pretty much every demographic that year. Even ones that had historically gone for Democrats. Women, Catholics, you name it. Yet studies in 1984 showed that most people sided with the Democratic Party on questions of welfare spending. They just believed that the Democrats, unlike Reagan, were incompetent at managing the economy.</p> \n\n<p>Is that racism? Or is it the fact that Carter put the economy into recession in order to save bondholders? This is the president who went on television to tell working Americans that from now on, they&#8217;d have to do more with less. The president whose appointee to the chair of the Federal Reserve, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Paul Volcker</a>, said in 1979: &#8220;The standard of living of the average American has to decline.&#8221; I&#8217;d call that a pretty good indicator that his party wasn&#8217;t that interested in its working-class constituents.</p> \n\n<p>After all, &#8220;doing more with less&#8221; certainly didn&#8217;t apply to the wealthy of this country. Do liberals think the working classes simply wouldn&#8217;t notice that this new frugal standard applied only to themselves? While Reagan ran on &#8220;Morning in America,&#8221; the Democrats became the party of austerity and balanced budgets. Dukakis, in his 1988 convention biopic, was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/06/us/more-wealth-than-meets-the-eye-lies-behind-frugal-dukakis-image.html?pagewanted=all\" type=\"external\">depicted</a> as mowing his own lawn with an old-fashioned push-mower. Apparently, a gasoline-powered motor would just be too decadent.</p> \n\n<p>The pundit class, however, can&#8217;t see these flaws. As members of wealthy, coastal communities, its backers see only the symbolic achievements of the twenty-first-century Democrats and none of the failures. We are talking about a class <a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/trumpism-is-a-politics-of-loss-and-revenge\" type=\"external\">of</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesSurowiecki/status/789175810015932416\" type=\"external\">people</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/08/angry-white-men-love-donald-trump\" type=\"external\">who</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/opinion/trump-reflects-white-male-fragility.html\" type=\"external\">believe</a> <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2016/04/30/we_must_shame_dumb_trump_fans_the_white_working_class_are_not_victims/\" type=\"external\">the</a> anger and bitterness of white working-class middle Americans in 2016 is rooted in the anxiety that &#8220;their whiteness has lost its value.&#8221; No, it couldn&#8217;t be that they&#8217;ve lost their livelihoods, families, or homes &#8212; it&#8217;s that they&#8217;ve just been told George Wallace isn&#8217;t coming to save them after all. It&#8217;s not only not true, it&#8217;s garbage politics.&amp;#160;In effect, it is nothing more than academic jargon used by the affluent to dismiss and slander working people&#8217;s rightful belief that as a society grows far wealthier (as the United States has over the past several decades), they&#8217;re entitled to rising expectations &#8212; not diminished ones.</p> \n\n<p>Thanks to WikiLeaks, we now know that Apple CEO Tim Cook and Bill Gates &#8212; the billionaire who has been leading the movement to destroy public education &#8212; both made it onto <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2016/10/18/13315952/hillary-clinton-wikileaks-running-mate-tim-cook-bill-gates\" type=\"external\">Clinton&#8217;s shortlist</a> for running-mate. This is the party rejected by white workers supposedly out of &#8220;racism&#8221; and nothing more &#8212; not the party of civil rights and Medicare. The obstinate belief that good and sincere pro-labor politicians like Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren, Tom Perez, and Keith Ellison are in the driver&#8217;s seat of the Democratic Party is simply a delusion. If the Democratic Party is Madison Square Garden, then Andrew Cuomo, Chuck Schumer, and the Clintons sit courtside, chatting with the players. Sanders, Warren, and Brown are up in the nosebleeds.</p> \n\n<p>So what is to be done when the Democratic Party of 2016 can win neither Congress nor the majority of state governments? According to the pundit class, we&#8217;re supposed to just wait. A decade or two. Instead of adopting Sanders&#8217;s class politics to <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">win over</a> the entire working class, many liberal pundits would prefer we simply wait twenty years when the white working class will no longer be a majority of workers. Demography, they seem to believe, is political destiny. Somehow, I kind of doubt that an eighty-six year-old senator Chuck Schumer will announce in the year 2036 that his party intends to finally &#8220;extinguish the billionaire class.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>I can understand how appealing it is to believe that it&#8217;s simply &#8220;miserable, angry whites&#8221; and their racism that&#8217;s holding back the Democratic Party from becoming either a social-democratic powerhouse or one that can at least expand on the achievements of its mid-century golden age all over again. It certainly seems easier to just wait patiently than to fight some of the most powerful people in the country for control over a party that is, structurally, far more theirs than ours &#8212; likely, irrevocably so.</p> \n\n<p>But demographics won&#8217;t turn the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">party of Silicon Valley</a> into the party of Chicago&#8217;s South Side or West Virginia&#8217;s coal country. All that waiting will do is prolong the undeniable suffering felt both by Trump and Clinton&#8217;s working-class supporters &#8212; and the large number of low-income Americans who don&#8217;t vote at all. Because that suffering isn&#8217;t exclusive to downscale Trumpists &#8212; &#8220;the deplorables&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s everyone who works or desperately hopes to work for a measly wage in order to survive. In other words, not the pundits who have next to nothing in common with them.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s not just &#8220;vulgar class-first&#8221; issues where the Democrats are failing &#8212; the party&#8217;s nationwide marginalization means, in much of the country, it&#8217;s been decades since it&#8217;s been this difficult to start or join a labor union or have access to abortion services. Despite having largely shed the &#8220;racist&#8221; white working class from the Democrat&#8217;s electoral coalition, the black-white wage gaps are now <a href=\"http://www.epi.org/publication/black-white-wage-gaps-expand-with-rising-wage-inequality/\" type=\"external\">larger today</a> than they were in 1979. And therein lies the central irony of the Democrats&#8217; tighter rhetorical embrace of social liberalism alongside a staunch rejection of populist class politics: they actually made far more progress on the former when they were a party capable of the latter.</p> \n\n<p>The belief that bringing in the nonvoting white working class requires surrendering on commitments to gender equality and antiracism is simply that &#8212; a belief. Sanders simultaneously attracted the support of white working-class voters in states like Indiana, Wisconsin, and Michigan even as he repeatedly championed Black Lives Matter and the fight against racial discrimination. There was no Sister Souljah moment with Bernie. The idea that bringing in certain segments of the working class automatically negates the coalition&#8217;s commitment to social liberalism is a myth.</p> \n\n<p>Among non-Evangelical Protestants, black voters still disproportionately <a href=\"http://www.pewforum.org/2016/05/12/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/\" type=\"external\">oppose same-sex marriage</a> even as they disproportionately vote Democratic. In 2008, African-American Protestants strongly supported Prop 8 in California. By our punditocracy&#8217;s &#8220;working-class contaminant&#8221; theory, the Democratic Party would be forced to choose here between commitment to same-sex marriage and their black Protestant voters. Yet neither has been &#8220;purged&#8221; from the coalition. And, steadily, progress has been made &#8212; far more Democrats, black Protestants, and Americans support same-sex marriage now than they did fifteen years ago.</p> \n\n<p>So while we&#8217;re told about just how insane white workers are for voting the way they do, I frankly don&#8217;t find it surprising. Many still vote for today&#8217;s affluent, professional-class Democratic Party with low expectations. Some, with no labor union or political organization to corral them, fall back onto reactionary prejudices and throw in with people like Trump for the worst reasons.</p> \n\n<p>And most, understandably, just stay home on Election Day. Until we change that fact, social justice in the United States will continue to remain out of reach for everyone who has to work for a living.</p>", "title": "This Didn\u2019t Have to Happen", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://jacobinmag.com/2016/10/democratic-party-clinton-trump-white-voters-workers/", "published_at": "2018-10-04", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>F.

They are different from you and me.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s 2015, and the decadence that differentiates the very rich is still a uniquely American obsession. And while the narrators have changed and the stories have shifted, we&#8217;re still listening. Wednesday Martin&#8217;s <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Primates of Park Avenue</a> recently made headlines for its detailed, pseudo-anthropological study of the Upper East Side and its rarified inhabitants. The memoir is small enough to fit in a Birkin, but with the kind of explosive potential that gets you permanently barred from Temple Emanu-El. It charts the progress of Upper East Side mothers with the thoroughness of a serial killer and the eye of a Bloomingdale&#8217;s head shopper. Martin jots down details ranging from drinks of choice (anything alcoholic) to trending exercise regimens (if you have to ask, you&#8217;ll never be in the SoulCycle front row). From summers spent at Long Island&#8217;s East Egg&#8212;I mean East End&#8212;to alleged &#8220;wife bonuses,&#8221; no tidbit is too personal.</p> \n\n<p>The Upper East Side Mom is similarly studied in Bravo&#8217;s new scripted TV show <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Odd Mom Out</a>. Odd Mom Out follows one quirky mother, played by Upper East Side native Jill Kargman, as she navigates the world of Rockefellers, Roman numerals, and really, really rich people.</p> \n\n<p>The Upper East Side has always held pop cultural appeal, from F. Scott Fitzgerald to The Official Preppy Handbook. More recently, a glut of TV shows including Gossip Girl, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">The Real Housewives of New York City</a>, and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">NYC Prep</a> have attempted to offer a penthouse window view of Manhattan&#8217;s elite. These shows are all fueled by an appetite that combines fantasy and righteous contempt, and they trade in stereotypes that recycle an unbelievable, ratings-pandering approximation of the Upper East Side that&#8217;s as unreal, tragic, and glamorous as Jay Gatsby himself. Like all TV shows that weren&#8217;t created by Shonda Rhimes, they follow a predictable recipe for maximum sleaze, shock, and envy, and revolve around predictable obsessions: prep schools, absentee parents, lavish parties, insane real estate, and designer clothes.</p> \n\n<p>The Upper East side that spans around thirty blocks and a handful of avenues on the island of Manhattan contains a number of elite private schools, many of them single-sex, all boasting high average SAT scores and fro-yo machines with a range of flavors. The non-existent, magical Upper East Side that exists in the minds of Real Housewives and Gossip Girl fan club presidents is a whole different story. In Primates of Park Avenue, housewives are totally high on higher education. Ivy League admission is presented not as the goal but as the norm&#8212;attending the most expensive pre-schools and private academies is a progeny prerequisite, and having a Princeton-degreed daddy isn&#8217;t the golden ticket it used to be. Martin <a href=\"http://www.popsugar.com/moms/Primates-Park-Avenue-Book-Excerpt-37646805\" type=\"external\">writes</a>, &#8220;The specter of failing to land one's child in an elite school&#8212;in the altered ecology of the Upper East Side, this was the terrifying predator to be outwitted and bested.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But according to shows like Gossip Girl and NYC Prep, the real challenge isn&#8217;t landing a spot in an elite private school, but rather surviving the best education you can buy your way into. Every girl&#8217;s book bag is designer, every boy owns an ascot and a boat in Maine, and being from Brooklyn is enough to merit social pariah status. Disappointingly enough, most of these juicy descriptions read more like the work of a private school creative writing class than an accurate reflection of reality&#8212;not that most traditional prep schools offer hippie classes like creative writing, which would be impossible to fit into a schedule packed with four AP&#8217;s, Latin, and Greek.</p> \n\n<p>For one thing, not everyone at these schools is a Blair Waldorf. I attended one of the oldest private schools in New York, a school so status-obsessed that it actually boasts of being the longest continuously run school in Manhattan&#8212;because it sided with the British. While I saw my share of Cartier love bracelets floundering around on the wrists of 15-year-old girls, the over-spending was far more contained and far less evocative of the fall of the Roman Empire than television would have you believe. No one was mocked for wearing Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch jeans or Gap polo shirts. We did not all live on Park or summer in the Hamptons. In fact, I don&#8217;t think I ever heard summer sincerely used as a verb until I watched the first few episodes of Odd Mom Out. People actually worked hard; a rich boy like Chuck Bass would not be able to earn a diploma simply by repeating the motto of &#8220;I&#8217;m Chuck Bass&#8221; to school administrators (or club bouncers, for that matter).</p> \n\n<p>Gossip Girl relied on the premise that rich Upper East Siders can buy, do, and get away with anything. It centered on drugs, sex, and parties, and looked more like a Madonna-envisioned bacchanalia than any teenager&#8217;s lived existence. Upper East Siders are actually just like other teenagers&#8212;they smoke pot in parks, hang out in living rooms with their friends, and try to convince people to buy them alcohol.</p> \n\n<p>On NYC Prep, the tragically singular first season culminates in a lavish gala. On Gossip Girl, everyone and their literal mothers are obsessed with debutante balls, the WASP-y ceremony where young girls symbolically enter society. The debutante ball is another excuse for Blair, Serena, and their interchangeable arm candy to don Net-a-Porter level couture and drink and bicker like adults. For the record, debutante balls are the purview of a few, very traditional families. Similarly galas, like weekly drinks at Lavo, are a largely fantastical element of the Upper East Side experience, at least for the younger set. And when/if Upper East Side kids go out they have to use fake ID&#8217;s, just like the rest of us&#8212;having a trust fund and living on 70th and Park doesn&#8217;t magically make you look like Blake Lively.</p> \n\n<p>Speaking of addresses, pop culture seems particularly obsessed with the geography of wealth. In multiple interviews, Odd Mom Out&#8217;s Jill Kargman <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/11/fashion/in-odd-mom-out-mining-the-upper-east-side-for-comedy-gold.html\" type=\"external\">describes her neighborhood</a> as &#8220;Durito, for &#8216;Down under the Roosevelt Island Tram Pass.&#8217;&#8221; This differentiation between the fabled, gold-paved sidewalks of the iconic upper East and Kargman&#8217;s more humble real estate seems like a deliberate attempt at self-deprecation, equal parts reliable punch line and serious attempt to cast Kargman as an outsider amongst insiders. This subtle distinction allows Kargman&#8217;s Bravo character to parody the Upper East Side even as a one-percenter participant.</p> \n\n<p>Pop culture approximations of the fabulously wealthy make a huge mistake in limiting their purview to one piece of Manhattan. Wolves of Wall Street mark out their territory everywhere from gorgeous townhouses in TriBeCa to Upper West Side apartments. Yes, they even live in Brooklyn (not to mention Tenafly and Scarsdale). The most laughable moments on Gossip Girl are when insiders like Blair shamelessly mock Brooklyn boy Dan for his pauper&#8217;s loft in Williamsburg. The aforementioned loft, which could easily cover Dwell magazine and sell for millions, is offered as shorthand for outsider status. The implication is that the truly wealthy wouldn&#8217;t dare leave the bubble of the Upper East Side; that privilege exclusively presents as a building with a doorman, an implicit dress code, and a view of the Met. This same erroneous logic fuels the much-repeated myth that Upper East Siders don&#8217;t go downtown, or have never set foot on the subway. Even if you attended a mythical school like Dan and Blair did, you&#8217;ve probably still heard of gentrification.</p> \n\n<p>More importantly, the assumption that Dan and his sister Jenny&#8217;s real estate porn loft caused them extreme social discomfort erases the experience of those who truly deviate from the norm in prep school&#8212;students of color and kids who exist in a socioeconomic strata that&#8217;s markedly lower than their relatively wealthy peers. Despite <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/12/when-minority-students-attend-elite-private-schools/282416/\" type=\"external\">well-publicized diversity programs</a>, NYC private schoolers often self-segregate according to race or socioeconomic status. This phenomenon might explain, but does not justify, the lily-whiteness of shows like NYC Prep and Gossip Girl, where ambiguously ethnic characters are occasionally seen but rarely heard&#8212;transparent casting decisions that inadvertently mirror many real-life experiences of tokenization.</p> \n\n<p>Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.</p> \n\n<p>A speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).</p> \n\n<p>While living in Brooklyn is not realistic social suicide, Gossip Girl&#8217;s insistence on manufacturing a misfit is extremely telling. The myth of the Upper East Side is, after all, founded on the premise of privilege and exclusion. The 1 percent implies the other 99, outsiders with television sets and a complicated relationship to wealth that&#8217;s equal parts demonization and deification. Like all constructions, the Upper East Side serves a multitude of purposes, and is ultimately a reflection of those who are behind the lens, not under it. Almost every representation of the neighborhood features an outsider figure.</p> \n\n<p>In The Great Gatsby, narrator Nick Carraway famously &#8220;liked to walk up Fifth Avenue and pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few minutes I was going to enter their lives.&#8221; While NYC Prep&#8217;s token public schooler Taylor DiGiovanni never cited classic literature, her story is an extension of Nick&#8217;s: outsider fantasizes about entering the world of the elite, admires their designer labels and lavish circumstances, but is ultimately disenchanted by the superficiality and brutality of the pretty lives that pass her by.</p> \n\n<p>Similarly, when Gossip Girl&#8217;s Dan begins to associate with the upper echelon, fellow Brooklynite Vanessa narrates, &#8220;The outsider goes inside. A likable everyman's pursuit of his dream girl begins his descent into the bowels of hell. This is mythic stuff.&#8221; The couch-surfer pop psychology at work here is not difficult to analyze. We project on these outsiders, whose fringe existences highlight both the possibility of party crashing and the alluring exclusivity of the upper crust. The mythic Upper East Side is a classic, ivy-covered brick fa&#231;ade that doubles as a fortress. Through the eyes of the outsider, we are allowed to dream and aspire, and are ushered into a world that&#8217;s mirage-like in its decadence. Of course, that&#8217;s because it is a mirage, and our interlopers often find themselves unable to integrate and are ultimately cast out, thrust back into the &#8220;real world&#8221; of public school boyfriends and Brooklyn coffee shops.</p> \n\n<p>The trailer for 'Gossip Girl.'</p> \n\n<p>While this voyeuristic exercise allows the viewer a degree of fantasy-fulfillment, it also acts as a foil. The superficiality of the portrayed elite in tell-alls like Primates of Park Avenue and Odd Mom Out serves to highlight and reinforce the humility, humor, and all-around goodness of the outside observer. While Martin and Kargman might outwardly aspire to belong, they are also presented as more intelligent, self-aware, and present than their Upper East Side counterparts. This idolization of the outsider is especially prevalent at moments when the complicated American relationship towards insane wealth accumulation tips more towards admonishment than admiration.</p> \n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/12/xoxo-conspicuous-consumption-how-the-economy-killed-gossip-girl/266181/\" type=\"external\">the Atlantic pointed out</a>, Gossip Girl was actually a victim of the recession. &#8220;When banks began to fail and the market plummeted in October 2008, a few episodes into Gossip Girl's second season, public opinion turned swiftly and dramatically against the very rich.&#8221; Aspiring to join the one percent became as pass&#233; as Tory Burch flats. We didn&#8217;t want to envy the ultra-rich&#8212;we wanted to crucify them. Cue the rising popularity of The Real Housewives of New York City, which was first aired in 2008. The real housewives, with their tacky dreams of fame and fortune and their televised social lives and squabbles, deconstructed the Upper East Side as it lampooned its inhabitants. Inverting Fitzgerald&#8217;s outsider&#8217;s fantasy, the show insisted that these wealthy residents were in fact just like us, that we could easily be Upper East Siders&#8212;if we were money-hungry socialites with surgically removed moral compasses. At the height of our hatred, we stopped looking in and sought to break through the penthouse windows&#8212;busting into private lives and passing judgment on the privileged.</p> \n\n<p>Odd Mom Out and Primates of Park Avenue are products of a post-recession era. According to <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/01/the-rise-of-the-new-global-elite/308343/\" type=\"external\">Holly Peterson</a>, the author of the Upper East Side-centric novel The Manny, &#8220;There&#8217;s so much money on the Upper East Side right now. If you look at the original movie Wall Street, it was a phenomenon where there were men in their 30s and 40s making $2 and $3 million a year, and that was disgusting. But then you had the Internet age, and then globalization, and you had people in their 30s, through hedge funds and Goldman Sachs partner jobs, who were making $20, $30, $40 million a year.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>American dreamers are reverting to that potent mix of envy and admiration; fear of an increasing wealth disparity combined with a deep desire to wind up on the right side of the widening gap. The sleazy, semi-exploitation of the Housewives era is being combined with the classic envious outsider narrative.

Last month, Germany passed a new law threatening fines of up to $57 million for companies that don't comply quickly enough.</p> \n\n<p>Taxes have been a particular pressure point. Politicians in countries such as France and the U.K. have said tech giants declare too little profit in their countries and then manage to reduce whatever profit they do declare elsewhere in Europe by paying huge untaxed royalty fees that often end up in tax havens.</p> \n\n<p>Several European countries, other than France, have pursued Google for back taxes. Spain raided Google offices in Madrid last year, and the company earlier this year to pay Italian tax authorities EUR306 million ($349 million).</p> \n\n<p>The EU last year demanded that Ireland recoup as much as EUR13 billion ($14.8 billion) in back taxes from Apple Inc. stemming from profits the EU said Apple should have declared as taxable in Ireland, and it is investigating whether Amazon.com Inc. should owe back taxes to Luxembourg. Apple is appealing, and Amazon has said it pays all the tax it owes.</p> \n\n<p>The threat of legal action -- coupled with new tax rules proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and a new \"diverted profits tax\" in the U. K. -- has led companies to make structural changes. Last year, Facebook began directing U.K. clients to start paying an affiliate in the country rather than funneling that money through Ireland and then on to the Cayman Islands, boosting its tax payments in the U.K.</p> \n\n<p>Google also made a controversial tax deal with the U.K. that involves attributing more income to that country, therefore paying more taxes there.</p> \n\n<p>The French case indicates, however, that there may be limits to tax authorities' efforts to make significant clawbacks of taxes under existing laws.</p> \n\n<p>Similar to how Google operates in other large EU countries, its French unit doesn't sell ads to French customers, but rather offers only logistical and marketing support to the Google unit in Ireland that closes the advertising deals. Google Ireland pays the French unit for that support service, leaving a smaller profit in France than if the sales were booked in the country.</p> \n\n<p>The French tax authority argued that the structure is fictitious and that it believed French employees were actually selling ads in France. The authority said that meant the Google's Irish unit should have paid income and sales taxes as if it had a \"permanent establishment\" in France.</p> \n\n<p>But in its decision, the court backed Google's argument that its French employees were doing nothing more than preparatory work allowed under the Franco-Irish tax treaty.</p> \n\n<p>France's tax authority has separately complained to France's tax prosecutor, which said last year that it has been investigating the company since 2015 for aggravated tax evasion. Wednesday's court decision that Google doesn't owe any additional taxes could complicate that criminal case.</p> \n\n<p>Write to Sam Schechner at sam.schechner@wsj.com</p> \n\n<p>Corrections &amp;amp; Amplifications</p> \n\n<p>This item was corrected at 5:34 p.m. ET to show that the EU last year demanded that Ireland recoup as much as EUR13 billion ($14.8 billion) in back taxes from Apple.

Why? Fundamental to the crisis is the degree of federation it already has. Seventeen economically disparate nations bound their fortunes together in creating the euro zone, and it is exactly this that has thrown the European project into crisis.</p> \n\n<p>Large parts of the populations of Greece, Spain and Portugal have been forced into destitution; the economies of all 17 members of the euro zone have been gravely damaged; governments of the weaker countries have been stripped of policy autonomy and placed under the tutelage of a &#8220;troika&#8221; of foreigners from the EU Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, who are imposing uniform, highly controversial and thus far generally unsuccessful austerity programs.</p> \n\n<p>How would a strengthened European federation improve this situation? Advocates of federation can argue that if the individual states of the EU were under federal authority, they would not have been allowed to get into their present plight. But most of the damage was done by innocent submission of credulous policymakers to the conventional wisdom of the international marketplace, the self-interested advice and investment promotions of the international investment banks, and discredited academic theories of deregulated and autonomous &#8220;perfect&#8221; markets. If the European Union had become a federation when it expanded in 2004, can we believe that its leaders would have done otherwise? The whole European economy might be in worse shape than it is now.</p> \n\n<p>The writer Timothy Garton Ash wants Europe to &#8220;save&#8221; itself by &#8220;moving toward closer fiscal and political union.&#8221; This is Angela Merkel&#8217;s position as well. From Chancellor Merkel&#8217;s viewpoint, this might seem a solution because it implies a much more influential role for Germany. I think she underestimates the resistance of the smaller European countries to any federal authority (or indeed, to adoption of such a project).</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>Would federal authority have an answer to the authoritarian trends in the present internal politics of Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania &#8212; the kind of practices that gave the Balkans a bad name in the past? What can be expected from such candidate members as Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia in a new federation? Garton Ash knows the Balkans much better than most people, as well as the mafias in that part of Europe.</p> \n\n<p>The United States is usually cited by Europeans as an example of successful federation. It was in the beginning a group of 13 states with a shared language, literature, history, a common intellectual and moral formation, Christian religious values (despite major sectarian differences), and which possessed common expectations and understandings of politics and history. Nonetheless, the objections of the Southern states to yielding what originally had been understood as irrevocable state sovereignty were only overcome by a terrible civil war.</p> \n\n<p>The degree of integration and political agreement the major powers of Europe now have achieved came after centuries of rivalry among the British, Germanic, French, Spanish, Danish and Swedish peoples, to speak only of the traditional great powers of Western Europe, plus a profusion of wars culminating in two immense wars fought in nearly every quarter of the world. To think this is all over, and that European history has come to an end, defies the global political landscape of the present day.</p> \n\n<p>NATO&#8217;s Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen does his best to prepare and arm the European members of the alliance for &#8220;key security threats from global challenges.&#8221; Would a European federation go abroad to fight global threats? Which ones? European analysts argue that Europe&#8217;s present quasi-disarmed condition forfeits global influence. It does, but are Germany, Sweden, Slovenia, Macedonia, Italy, Spain and all the others in the EU prepared to commit troops to a European foreign expeditionary army to recover Europe&#8217;s world influence?</p> \n\n<p>To my foreigner&#8217;s eyes, the future of Europe best lies in the union it already possesses. I am confident that the euro can and should survive, but possibly as part of a double-currency system in economically weaker countries, where the euro would function as the international exchange currency and the reference value for floating national currencies.</p> \n\n<p>There would be a common foreign policy exercising probably the world&#8217;s most powerful armory of the instruments of &#8220;soft&#8221; power. The major European states, the former &#8220;great powers,&#8221; could individually or cooperatively, according to their choice, play an armed role in the external world, as they do now, with such support and endorsement as their fellow EU members may wish to provide. In circumstances now unforeseeable, the Union as a whole might wish to adopt common defensive and deterrent measures. Europe in this way could be a different global &#8220;great power.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Visit William Pfaff&#8217;s website for more on his latest book, &#8220;The Irony of Manifest Destiny: The Tragedy of America&#8217;s Foreign Policy&#8221; (Walker &amp;amp; Co., $25), at <a href=\"http://www.williampfaff.com\" type=\"external\">www.williampfaff.com</a>. &#169; 2012 Tribune Media Services, Inc.</p>", "title": "The Root of Europe's Problem", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/the-root-of-europes-problem/", "published_at": "2012-09-05", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>U.S. job growth likely slowed in August after two straight months of robust gains, but the pace of increase should be more than sufficient for the Federal Reserve to announce a plan to start trimming its massive bond portfolio.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>According to a Reuters survey of economists, the Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday will probably show that nonfarm payrolls increased by 180,000&amp;#160;jobslast month.</p> \n\n<p>That would be close to the 184,000 monthly average employment gains for this year and far more than what is needed to keep up with growth in the work-age population.</p> \n\n<p>While the job gains would clear the path for the U.S. central bank to outline a plan to start shrinking its $4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at its Sept. 19-20 policy meeting, tepid wage growth could leave a December interest rate increase in doubt.</p> \n\n<p>Average hourly earnings are forecast rising 0.2 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in June, likely keeping the year-on-year gain in wages at 2.5 percent for a fifth consecutive month.</p> \n\n<p>Sluggish wage growth would come on the heels of a report on Thursday showing the Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, increased 1.4 percent in the 12 months to July - the smallest rise in just over 1-1/2 years.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>\"The job market is in very good shape, but wage growth is very disappointing and that's likely to continue for over the next several months,\" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. \"Whether or not the Fed moves in December will be contingent on inflation.\"</p> \n\n<p>U.S. financial markets are pricing in a roughly 36 percent probability of a rate hike at the Fed's December meeting according to CME Group's FedWatch program.

Over the last several years, the initial August job count has tended to underestimate employment growth because of seasonal factors.</p> \n\n<p>They could also beat expectations as online retailer Amazon.com held a series of job fairs to hire about 50,000 workers last month. No impact is expected from Hurricane Harvey, which devastated parts of Texas, as the disaster happened after the survey period for the Augustjobs&amp;#160;report.</p> \n\n<p>The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000&amp;#160;jobs&amp;#160;per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population.

Looming ahead was Super Tuesday, and Virginia&#8217;s opportunity to weigh in on the race.</p> \n\n<p>Trump was feeling confident.</p> \n\n<p>Robertson, one of the old-guard evangelicals who won the Iowa caucuses in 1988, didn&#8217;t seem like the kind of Republican grandee who would get behind Trump.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>But in their talk, Robertson said to Trump, &#8220;You inspire us.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>It may have helped a bit in Virginia, where Trump defeated Rubio, a senator from Florida, by three percentage points in the March 1 primary.</p> \n\n<p>Now Trump returns. He still has the support of evangelical leaders such as Robertson (who called the candidate&#8217;s lewd remarks about women &#8220;macho&#8221; talk). He has the support of Liberty University&#8217;s Jerry Falwell Jr., as well.</p> \n\n<p>But do Virginia voters still support Trump?</p> \n\n<p>A Christopher Newport University poll released last week said they don&#8217;t. Trump only leads the field in southwest Virginia. In Hampton Roads, where Regent is located, the CNU poll shows Trump lagging far behind Hillary Clinton and Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson nipping at his heels.</p> \n\n<p>Worse for Trump, the CNU poll shows military voters, a traditionally Republican constituency, back Clinton.</p> \n\n<p>So, with his numbers cratering to the point that states such as Arizona, Georgia and Utah may be in play, why is Trump returning to Virginia Beach?</p> \n\n<p>It could be ego. Trump needs to show that the recent disarray in his campaign, which saw his long-time Virginia co-chairman Corey Stewart fired for staging an unauthorized protest outside of Republican National Committee headquarters, has done nothing to dim his hopes of winning here.</p> \n\n<p>It could be convenience: The Virginia Beach market spills over into North Carolina, another state where he trails and that he needs desperately to win.</p> \n\n<p>Or it could be that despite all the evidence, Trump agrees with something Robertson recently said:</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Trump is like the Phoenix. They think he&#8217;s dead, he&#8217;s come back. And he came back strong. In the meantime, he speaks to adoring thousands wherever he goes.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Trump may indeed think he&#8217;s still got what it takes to win, even in a state like Virginia and that he can again turn all the bad press, weak polls and personal failings into a triumph.</p> \n\n<p>But Rubio&#8217;s words echo across the Virginia landscape: At a Chesterfield County stop in late February, just a few days after Trump and Robertson&#8217;s first meeting, Rubio told the crowd Trump was a &#8220;con artist&#8221; who threatened &#8220;the very identity of the United States.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Public perception of Trump hasn&#8217;t changed much since then. While Robertson contends Trump can rise like a phoenix, it appears Rubio&#8217;s criticisms, months after the fact, are what actually sprung from the ashes.</p> \n\n<p>&#8212;</p> \n\n<p>Norman Leahy is a political reporter for the American Media Institute and producer of the Score radio show.</p> \n\n<p>trump-virginia-comment</p>", "title": "Virginia for the Win: Donald Trump tries to rise again in the Old Dominion", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/872573/virginia-for-the-win-donald-trump-tries-to-rise-again-in-the-old-dominion.html", "published_at": "", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>A brief history of the long, rocky relationship between the United States and Cuba, from the Spanish-American War through the recent reestablishment of diplomatic relations, as told in pictures.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />", "title": "120 Years of Rocky US-Cuba Relations, in Pictures", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2015/08/united-states-cuba-castro-history-photos/", "published_at": "2018-09-01", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>By Jeff Brumley</p> \n\n<p>The term &#8220;Baptist peacemaking&#8221; conjures up images of President Jimmy Carter observing elections on troubled continents. For others it means human rights activists brokering peace deals between warring factions in Africa or the Middle East.</p> \n\n<p>But it doesn&#8217;t mean only that, says LeDayne McLeese Polaski, the program coordinator for the <a href=\"http://www.bpfna.org/\" type=\"external\">Baptist Peace Fellowship of North America</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Peacemaking can also include actions like mentoring inner-city children and writing members of Congress about public policy issues trying to understand why a local school is under-resourced, Polaski said.</p> \n\n<p>Basically, any action that promotes justice leads to peace, and that means a lot of Baptists and other Christians are peacemakers without even knowing it.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Part of our job is to help others see what they are already doing and name it as peacemaking,&#8221; Polaski said. &#8220;A lot of churches are already doing something.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Creating new traditions</p> \n\n<p>The nature and state of Baptist peacemaking has entered the spotlight with <a href=\"ministry/people/item/28631-glen-stassen-baptist-peacemaker-dead-at-78#.U2AKAK1dWaE\" type=\"external\">the April 26 death</a> of Baptist theologian Glen Stassen, known for his writings and teachings on the ethics of war and peace.</p> \n\n<p>Stassen, who was 78 when he died in California, taught at Southern Baptist Theological and Fuller Theological seminaries, among other colleges and universities. He was for 30 years a leading voice for peace and his groundbreaking book, Just Peacemaking, promoted positive and practical steps to end war.</p> \n\n<p>Stassen propelled Baptists into a Christian context where the active peace movement was led by Mennonites, Quakers and others.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Glen Stassen created a new tradition for peacemaking among Baptists,&#8221; said Robert Parham, the founder and executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.ethicsdaily.com/\" type=\"external\">Baptist Center for Ethics</a>&amp;#160;and a former student of Stassen&#8217;s at Southern.</p> \n\n<p>Parham and other members of an ethics course taught by Stassen drafted a resolution in support of nuclear arms control. The resolution was adopted by the Southern Baptist Convention in 1978.</p> \n\n<p>&#8216;On the outer circle&#8217;</p> \n\n<p>The core of Stassen&#8217;s theology on peacemaking was that the Sermon on the Mount was a commandment his followers were to take seriously, Parham said. &amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;He challenged the common reading in many churches that [the sermon] was an idealistic statement,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Glen believed it was a realistic statement.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He also lived out his theology, still traveling the world as an advocate and activist for peace.</p> \n\n<p>But Stassen&#8217;s single-minded focus on peacemaking didn&#8217;t make huge inroads in Baptist life, Parham said.</p> \n\n<p>While working to educate and motivate Baptists to take a practical view of the Sermon on the Mount as the basis for peacemaking and human rights, he was limited by a denominational context &#8220;where Southern Baptist fundamentalists were more committed to Leviticus than the synoptic Gospels.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He was also challenged by a larger culture &#8212;&amp;#160;reflected by his denomination &#8212;&amp;#160;that is predisposed to the use of military force, Parham added.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;He created a new tradition of peacemaking among Baptists, but he was never successful in moving that tradition into the mainstream of Baptist churches,&#8221; Parham said. &#8220;Peacemaking remains on the outer circle of the Baptist moral agenda.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8216;Increasing incrementally&#8217;</p> \n\n<p>But there is reason to be optimistic about the present and future of Baptist peace activism, as some participants note an increasing presence of Baptists in ongoing campaigns.</p> \n\n<p>The Baptist World Alliance and the Baptist Peace Fellowship continue to do excellent work while individual Baptist scholars and theologians are more and more involved in peace delegations to war-torn and hostile nations, said Jim Jennings, the founder of <a href=\"http://www.conscienceinternational.org/\" type=\"external\">Conscience International</a> and a member of First Baptist Church in Gainesville, Ga.</p> \n\n<p>In January, Jennings led&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">a delegation of American scholars</a> to Iran for talks with Iranian academics and government officials. One of the leading American delegates was Rob Nash of Mercer University&#8217;s McAfee School of Theology.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s increasing incrementally,&#8221; Jennings said. There will be natural limits to that increase based on the attitudes of society.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Baptists are a reflection of the political spectrum of our country &#8212;&amp;#160;and probably in other countries as well.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Personally, Jennings said his Baptist faith is a &#8220;100 percent&#8221; motivator of the peace and justice work he does around the world.</p> \n\n<p>That work has taken him to Iran, Syria, the Sudan and Lebanon. He&#8217;s also met with &#8220;Islamic organizations that have intimidating names&#8221; to Americans.</p> \n\n<p>His drive matches Stassen&#8217;s in this regard, Jennings said.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Everything springs out of a vision of peace that when Jesus says &#8216;blessed are the peacemakers,&#8217; it is incumbent on us as Christians to follow that.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Bringing &#8216;real change&#8217;</p> \n\n<p>Another trend some are noticing is that many Baptist peace and justice activists are flat-out exhausted, Polaski said.</p> \n\n<p>That comes from years spent, domestically and internationally, combating poverty, racism, education inequality and other social ills.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;There are a lot who &#8230; are tired because they are working on issues that don&#8217;t get fixed in a lifetime,&#8221; Polaski said. &#8220;No matter how faithful you are, no matter how hard you try, you are not going to fix poverty.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But there is a positive trend at the same time where the work by Baptists around the world are being seen to influence more positive behavior among those being helped, she added.</p> \n\n<p>Those strides are made where Baptists are teaching conflict transformation skills in settings ranging from American churches to villages in Africa.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Peacemakers are people who respond to inevitable conflict in ways that go deeper, in ways that bring real healing and ways that bring real change,&#8221; Polaski said.</p> \n\n<p>Baptist peacemaking is moving ahead, she added.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;While some people are tired and frustrated because a lot of injustice is still out there, I also see people who are making a real difference every single day.&#8221;</p>", "title": "Activists reflect on Baptist peacemaking in wake of Stassen death", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://baptistnews.com/article/activists-reflect-on-baptist-peacemaking-in-wake-of-stassen-death/", "published_at": "", "bias": 3}, {"text": "<p>.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........</p> \n\n<p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. &#8212; Chocolate lovers are in for a treat at this year&#8217;s Balloon Fiesta.</p> \n\n<p>The Albuquerque Balloon Museum is hosting the first ever Big Top Chocolate Festival on the Balloon Museum lawn on Saturday, October 6 and Sunday, Oct. 7 from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. The festival will feature over 25 chocolatiers, coffee roasters, bakers, baristas and more throughout New Mexico.</p> \n\n<p>Tickets are $10 for adults and $1 for children (ages 4 to 12).

So let me say on the record, any ad which quotes what I said on Sunday is a falsehood, because I have publicly said those words were inaccurate and unfortunate.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>A grateful nation thanks you, Newt Gingrich. The presidential campaign is just starting, and already you&#8217;ve given us a passage that will live in infamy &#8212; forever &#8212; in the annals of American political speech. Your delightful quotation shall be filed under &#8220;fiascos&#8221; and flagged with a cross-reference to &#8220;utter nonsense.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>I can&#8217;t remember when we&#8217;ve heard a politician plead so desperately to take back something he said. Then again, naked desperation is clearly in order. The favorite parlor game in Washington this week has been trying to remember a more disastrous campaign launch than the one Gingrich is having. Many candidates have stumbled coming out of the gate, but few have taken off like a shot in the wrong direction.</p> \n\n<p>The great irony, of course, is that Gingrich&#8217;s grievous error was to speak the truth. Appearing on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; last Sunday, he referred to the proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to convert Medicare into a voucher program &#8212; endorsed by all but four members of the GOP majority in the House &#8212; as &#8220;right-wing social engineering.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>He went on, &#8220;I think that that is too big a jump. I think that what you want to have is a system where people voluntarily migrate to better outcomes, better solutions, better options.&#8221; He said he considered President Obama&#8217;s health care reform law to be &#8220;radical change&#8221; and added that &#8220;I would be against a conservative imposing radical change.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Prominent Republicans immediately grabbed their pitchforks, lit their torches and formed an angry mob. From opinion surveys and town-hall meetings, it was already clear that the Ryan plan to fundamentally alter the Medicare program is deeply unpopular &#8212; and that ultimately it is likely to hurt the party at the polls. Now one of the best-known figures in the party, a candidate for the presidential nomination, was breaking ranks. Rather than accept the fact that Gingrich is right &#8212; or was right, since he now wants us to forget he ever appeared on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; &#8212; Republicans mau-maued him into a full-throated disavowal.</p> \n\n<p>First he tried to claim that host David Gregory had somehow bamboozled him with a trick question; this &#8220;babe in the woods&#8221; defense was laughable, given that Gingrich had been on the show 34 times before Sunday&#8217;s self-immolation. Then he claimed he actually supported the Ryan plan but believed the groundwork, in terms of public opinion, hadn&#8217;t been properly laid. Finally, he just gave up and demanded to take it all back.</p> \n\n<p>But by then, video was already circulating of an encounter Gingrich had with an Iowa voter who told him that &#8220;what you just did to Paul Ryan is unforgivable.&#8221; When Gingrich mildly protested, the man persisted: &#8220;Yes, you did. You undercut him and his allies in the House. You&#8217;re an embarrassment to our party. &#8230; Why don&#8217;t you get out before you make a bigger fool of yourself?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Gingrich&#8217;s week just couldn&#8217;t get any worse. But then it did.</p> \n\n<p>While he and his wife Callista were at a book signing in Minnesota on Tuesday, a gay-rights activist showered the candidate with colorful glitter. That same day, it was reported that Callista Gingrich, in disclosure reports she was required to file when she worked for the House Agriculture Committee, stated that at one point the couple owed between $250,000 and $500,000 to Tiffany&#8217;s. So much for understanding the struggles of everyday Americans.</p> \n\n<p>To cap it all off, Gingrich&#8217;s press secretary, Rick Tyler, was asked by the Huffington Post to comment on media coverage of his candidate. Tyler&#8217;s response suggests that the next time he sends someone out for coffee, he might ask for decaf. &#8220;The literati sent out their minions to do their bidding,&#8221; it begins, before going on to describe an epic &#8220;firefight&#8221; that somehow involves sheep, cocktail parties and bylines.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;A lesser person could not have survived the first few minutes of the onslaught,&#8221; Tyler wrote. &#8220;But out of the billowing smoke and dust of tweets and trivia emerged Gingrich, once again ready to lead those who won&#8217;t be intimidated by the political elite.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>I must note that Gingrich, a former House speaker, has been a card-carrying member of the political elite for years. But don&#8217;t you dare quote me.</p> \n\n<p>Eugene Robinson&#8217;s e-mail address is eugenerobinson(at)washpost.com.</p> \n\n<p>&#169; 2011, Washington Post Writers Group</p>", "title": "Meltdown on the Launch Pad", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/meltdown-on-the-launch-pad/", "published_at": "2011-05-20", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>There is no way to prove this, but see if you agree with me: The average American parent would be glad to see his public high school celebrate Martin Luther King Day with tributes to the Civil Rights Movement, lectures on the history of slavery and Jim Crow, and discussions of the challenges faced by blacks and other minorities in America today. Actually, it&#8217;s not really a guess, because curricula like that are found throughout the nation.</p> \n\n<p>The program that is being imposed on Winnetka, Ill., by contrast, is hard-left indoctrination that could have come straight from the pages of Howard Zinn. In 2016 it was held on MLK Day itself, but this year&#8217;s Seminar Day on race, &#8220;Understanding Today&#8217;s Struggle for Racial Civil Rights,&#8221; is scheduled for Tuesday, February 28.</p> \n\n<p>The all-school program will feature a full day of lectures and seminars, and as the title betrays, the slant is built in. As one of the parents who have protested the content noted, civil rights are for everyone, aren&#8217;t they? There are no &#8220;racial&#8221; rights. That was Martin Luther King&#8217;s point, or one of them.</p> \n\n<p>New Trier has scheduled two keynote speakers and dozens of seminars for the 4,000 students to choose among. One or two are unobjectionable, like &#8220;Black Gospel Music: Make a Joyful Noise!&#8221; or &#8220;Rap with a Social Conscience&#8221; (though much would depend upon which rap was discussed). But the rest of the offerings are thoroughly turgid agitprop. Students can attend a session titled &#8220;Seeing the Unseen: The Bias All Around You,&#8221; or learn to &#8220;recognize our own implicit biases.&#8221; They can attend seminars about &#8220;cultural appropriation,&#8221; &#8220;trans people of color navigating the U.S.,&#8221; &#8220;race, class, and police interactions,&#8221; &#8220;systemic racism in housing,&#8221; &#8220;myths&#8221; about affirmative action in college admissions, and &#8220;21st century voter suppression.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>High-school students usually range in age from 14 to 18, so you might imagine that some care would be taken to avoid speakers whose social media are rife with profanity, racial epithets, and sexual content. No. Political radicalism means all is permitted. John the Author, one of the invited speakers, raps about &#8220;Blackenomics,&#8221; which includes the following lyrics:</p> \n\n<p>I don&#8217;t wanna be king, but I&#8217;m the only one ready for it now, Cause all these other niggas selling out, Individualism is all these motherf***ers yelling about</p> \n\n<p>Divide and conquer, white supremacy the silent monster</p> \n\n<p>One might have hoped, in a program dedicated to civil rights and mutual understanding, that the guests themselves might steer clear of racism and anti-Semitism. Kevin Coval&#8217;s poem &#8220;Occupation,&#8221; says this about Israel: &#8220;Fascist ones believe in one monotheism, a walled prison, Israelis sleep through the night.&#8221; Monica Trinidad will conduct a talk on &#8220;We Charge Genocide: An Emergence of a Continued Movement.&#8221; Her Twitter feed encourages people to boycott an Israeli dance troupe (&#8220;Don&#8217;t dance with apartheid!&#8221;) with a link to the BDS (boycott, divest, sanction) hashtag. She tweeted a picture of mounted police officers with the comment &#8220;Get them animals off those horses.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>So, one might suppose that New Trier parents would be enraged. Yet the pushback has been about as polite, substantive, and reasonable as you could possibly wish (especially in our bitter era). On their website, parentsofnewtrier.org, they suggest adding other speakers to achieve &#8212; wait for it &#8212; intellectual diversity. They note that, in contrast to what the seminars hammer home, people of the same race do not necessarily think alike. Among the speakers the parents group recommends: Shelby Steele, Jason Riley, John McWhorter, and Star Parker.</p> \n\n<p>Rather than marinate in doctrinaire leftism heavily inflected with a Black Lives Matter sensibility, the parents object, why not have students volunteer for the day (Chicago is 16 miles south)? The website offers other volunteering suggestions: &#8220;Good News Partners (Rogers Park), Connections for the Homeless (Evanston), Pastor Corey Brooks from New Beginnings Church in Woodlawn and &#8216;ProjectHood.org.&#8217;&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Despite multiple requests, school officials have refused every appeal from dismayed parents. No to additional speakers. No to adding another seminar at a later date for different viewpoints. No to requiring that parents sign off on their children&#8217;s seminar-panel choices. No to postponing the program until parental input could be considered.</p> \n\n<p>New Trier has very few black students, but the father of one wrote this: &#8220;This group [the small group of faculty and students who developed the program] does NOT represent the best of black Americans and does not advocate anything that has a track record of making black lives better.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>These &#8220;check your privilege&#8221; brainwashing sessions have become commonplace at colleges. Parents don&#8217;t seem to know or care enough to protest. The New Trier parents group is a sign that resistance to deadening propaganda is alive and well &#8212; and polite.</p> \n\n<p>&#8212; Mona Charen is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.

This&amp;#160; comes as one more, probably unnecessary reminder of the total control exercised by Wall Street&amp;#160; over the Obama administration&#8217;s economic and financial policy.&amp;#160; True, Hormats is &#8220;a talker rather than a decider&#8221;&amp;#160;according to one former White House official, but he will find plenty of old friends used to making decisions, almost all of&amp;#160; them uniformly disastrous for the U.S. and global economy.</p> \n\n<p>Among the familiar Wall Street faces that Hormats will encounter in his new post will that of Deputy Secretary of State Jacob Lew, lately Chief Financial Officer of Citigroup Alternative Investments Group which lost $509 million in the first quarter of 2008 alone.&amp;#160; On visits to the White House he is sure to bump into Michael Froman, who also tore a swath through the Citi balance sheet at the alternative investments shop (they specialized in &#8220;esoteric&#8221; investments such as private highways) but is now Obama&#8217;s Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economic Affairs.&amp;#160; If Froman is otherwise engaged, Hormats can interface with Froman&#8217;s deputy, David Lipton, who was until recently running Citi&#8217;s global country risk management effort.</p> \n\n<p>Citigroup is also well represented at Treasury, in the form of Lewis Alexander, formerly the bank&#8217;s chief economist and now Counselor to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.&amp;#160; Given the role played by all of the above in bankrupting us all, Alexander&#8217;s 2007 verdict on the onset of the mortgage crash, &#8220;I think that&#8217;s not going to spill more broadly into the economy and so I think we&#8217;re going to have a normal kind of housing cycle though the middle of this year,&#8221; can only have been a recommendation in the eyes of his current employer.</p> \n\n<p>Alexander&#8217;s function at Citi may have been merely to endorse the financial depredations of colleagues with economic blather, rather than exercise loss-making functions personally.&amp;#160; Not so Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin, who has moved over to the number two job at the department from the Hartford Insurance Company, where he served as president and chief operating officer of the Property and Casualty Group.&amp;#160; Hartford was one of the insurance companies that got suckered by the banks into backing their ruinous investments in real estate and other esoterica, but Wolin&#8217;s Treasury has just handed Hartford $3.4 billion of our money in the form of TARP funds.</p> \n\n<p>Hormats&#8217; agricultural responsibilities will of necessity bring him into frequent contact with the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Gary Gensler &#8211;&amp;#160; a former Goldman partner.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; As Assistant Secretary of Treasury in the Clinton Adminsitration Gensler played a key role in greasing the skids for the notorious Commodity Futures Modernization Act of&amp;#160; 2000, which set the stage for the great credit default swaps scam that underpinned the recent bubble and subsequent collapse.&amp;#160; News of the appointment did generate threats of obstruction in the Senate &#8211; any one of&amp;#160; the senators could have blocked the appointment had they really wished to do so &#8211; but such threats proved predictably hollow.&amp;#160; Had they been otherwise, Treasury Chief of Staff Mark Patterson could of course have lent the expertise he gained as Goldman&#8217;s lobbyist to overcome the obstacle.</p> \n\n<p>For sheer gall it would be hard to equal the appointment of&amp;#160; Gensler, one of the engineers of this catastrophe, but the administration has managed it with the selection of Linda Robertson, formerly a key Enron lobbyist and intimately involved in pushing through the commodity futures act as chief flack&amp;#160; for the Federal Reserve.&amp;#160; Prior to joining the crooked energy-trading firm, Robertson was an important figure in the Clinton Treasury Department, latterly serving her friend Larry Summers and before him Robert Rubin during their terms as Treasury Secretaries.</p> \n\n<p>Such connection to the key enablers of our bankrupt casino helps explain many of the other hires listed above.&amp;#160; Michael Froman was Chief of Staff to Robert Rubin at Treasury before following Rubin to his reward at Citigroup.&amp;#160; Most significantly, it was Froman who first introduced Rubin to his Harvard classmate Barack Obama.&amp;#160; David Lipton also served in the Rubin Treasury, as deputy under secretary for international affairs.&amp;#160; Neal Wolin, on the other hand, appears to have more an acolyte of Summers, who cherished him as Treasury General Counsel from &#8217;99 to &#8217;01.&amp;#160; Summers and Robertson were similarly close, and certainly he raised no objection to her fatal submissions on behalf of her paymasters at Enron.</p> \n\n<p>Recent reports suggest that financial industry lobbying in Washington, at $104.7 million for the first three months of 2009, is 8% down on last year.&amp;#160;

She even had a signature phrase &#8212; &#8220;dahling,&#8221; in her florid Hungarian accent.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Zsa Zsa is unique. She&#8217;s a woman from the court of Louis XV who has somehow managed to live in the 20th century, undamaged by the PTA,&#8221; wrote author Gerald Frank, who helped Miss Gabor with her 1960 autobiography.</p> \n\n<p>She had nine husbands, but was still with Mr. von Anhalt more than 30 years after they were married.</p> \n\n<p>Ever the saucy personality, when Miss Gabor was asked &#8220;How many husbands have you had?&#8221; she replied, &#8220;You mean other than my own?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>As for the impact of the 1960s and feminism on much-married socialites, she replied: &#8220;The women&#8217;s movement hasn&#8217;t changed my sex life. It wouldn&#8217;t dare.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In her second autobiography, 1993&#8217;s &#8220;One Lifetime is Not Enough,&#8221; she claimed that her first sexual encounter was in 1932 with Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, when she was 15.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;For the rest of my life, I would search for another god to eclipse him,&#8221; Miss Gabor wrote.</p> \n\n<p>She had one daughter, Constance Francesca Hilton, born 1947 when she was married to hotelier Conrad Hilton, making Miss Gabor technically a distant relative to Paris Hilton.</p> \n\n<p>One of her splashiest tabloid appearance grew out of a 1989 traffic stop in which she slapped the face of a Beverly Hills policeman who stopped her Rolls-Royce on a traffic violation. Miss Gabor gleefully attacked the policeman&#8217;s character on TV afterward. Besides the assault on a lawman, she was convicted of driving without a license and an open-container violation.</p> \n\n<p>She was sentenced to three days in jail and community service, but refused to perform the latter and so served three more days in jail.</p> \n\n<p>And in a gesture that typified her insouciance, Miss Gabor made a joke of the whole thing for the opening credits of the 1991 cop-show-parody movie &#8220;The Naked Gun 2&#189;.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>After the siren that had been making its way through a whole series of impossibly surreal events pulls over a Rolls-Royce, Miss Gabor gets out of the car and slaps the siren, saying &#8220;this happens every f&#8211;ing time when I go shopping.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>After a 2002 auto accident in which Miss Gabor (a passenger) suffered partial paralysis, Miss Gabor basically retired from the public eye. Since then, she suffered multiple strokes, had part of her leg amputated, required a feeding tube, had a hip replacement and couldn&#8217;t even attend her birthday parties.</p> \n\n<p>Her husband reportedly even <a href=\"https://dailynewshungary.com/zsa-zsa-gabor-i-want-to-die-in-hungary/\" type=\"external\">kept from her</a> the news of daughter&#8217;s Francesca&#8217;s 2015 death from her, from fear she couldn&#8217;t handle it.

It ran a piece <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/11/03/why-denmark-isnt-the-utopian-fantasy-bernie-sanders-describes/?hpid=hp_rhp-top-table-main_wb-denmark-330pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory\" type=\"external\">telling readers</a>:</p> \n\n<p>Why Denmark Isn&#8217;t the Utopian Fantasy Bernie Sanders Describes</p> \n\n<p>The piece is centered on an interview with Michael Booth, a food and travel writer who has spent a considerable period of time in the Scandinavian countries.</p> \n\n<p>Much of the piece is focused on the alleged economic problems of Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries. At one point the interviewer, Ana Swanson, asks:</p> \n\n<p>Danes are experiencing a rising debt level, and a lower proportion of people working. Are these worrying signs for its economy or the country&#8217;s model?</p> \n\n<p>While Denmark&#8217;s employment rate has been declining, it is still far higher than the employment rate in the United States. The employment rate for prime age workers (ages 25&#8211;54) is still more than 5 full percentage points higher than in the United States. If the rate of decline since the 2001 peak continues, it will fall below the current US level in roughly 24 years. (The US rate also fell over this period.) If we take the broader 16&#8211;64 age group, then the <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=LFS_SEXAGE_I_R\" type=\"external\">gap falls slightly</a>, to 4.7 percentage points.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\" /></p> \n\n<p>As far as having an unsustainable debt level, Swanson seems somewhat confused. According to <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2015/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=43&amp;amp;pr.y=7&amp;amp;sy=2010&amp;amp;ey=2020&amp;amp;scsm=1&amp;amp;ssd=1&amp;amp;sort=country&amp;amp;ds=.&amp;amp;br=1&amp;amp;c=128%2C142%2C144%2C111&amp;amp;s=GGXCNL_NGDP%2CGGXWDN_NGDP%2CBCA_NGDPD&amp;amp;grp=0&amp;amp;a=\" type=\"external\">the IMF</a>, Denmark&#8217;s net debt-to-GDP ratio will be 6.3 percent at the end of this year. Sweden has a negative net debt, meaning the government owns more financial assets than the amount of debt it has outstanding. In Norway&#8217;s case, because of its huge oil assets, the proceeds of which it has largely saved, the government wealth-to-GDP ratio is almost 270 percent. This would be equivalent to having a public investment fund of more than $40 trillion in the United States.</p> \n\n<p>Some of the other assertions in the piece are either misleading or inaccurate. For example, Booth is quoted as saying:</p> \n\n<p>Meanwhile, though it is true that these are the most gender-equal societies in the world, they also record the highest rates of violence towards women&amp;#160;&#8212; only part of which can be explained by high levels of reporting of crime.</p> \n\n<p>Actually, Danish women are far less likely to be murdered by their husbands or boyfriends than women in the United States. Its <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/data.html\" type=\"external\">murder rate</a> is 0.8 per 100,000, compared to 4.7 per 100,000 in the United States.</p> \n\n<p>Later Booth is quoted as saying:</p> \n\n<p>In Denmark, the quality of the free&amp;#160;education and healthcare is substandard: They are way down on the PISA [ <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/pisa/\" type=\"external\">Programme for International Student Assessment</a>] educational rankings, have the lowest life expectancy in the region, and the highest rates of death from cancer. And there is broad consensus that the economic model of a public sector and welfare state on this scale is unsustainable.</p> \n\n<p>While Denmark is not among the leaders on either PISA scores or <a href=\"http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?order=wbapi_data_value_2013+wbapi_data_value+wbapi_data_value-last&amp;amp;sort=desc\" type=\"external\">life expectancy</a>, on both measures it is well ahead of the United States. And the &#8220;broad consensus that the economic model&#8230;is unsustainable&#8221; exists only in Booth&#8217;s head.</p> \n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/ctp/tax-policy/taxing-wages-tax-burden-trends-latest-year.htm\" type=\"external\">OECD figures</a>, labor is taxed more heavily in several non-Scandinavian countries, including Belgium, Austria, Germany, Hungary, France and Italy.</p> \n\n<p>Booth is also apparently confused about tax rates around the world. He tells readers:</p> \n\n<p>Denmark has the highest direct and indirect taxes in the world, and you don&#8217;t need to be a high earner to make it into the top tax bracket of 56 percent (to which you must add 25 percent value-added tax, the highest energy taxes in the world, car import duty of 180 percent, and so on).</p> \n\n<p>Actually, France has a top marginal tax rate of 75 percent. The U.S. rate was 90 percent during the Eisenhower administration.</p> \n\n<p>Booth apparently is confused about Denmark&#8217;s public spending. He tells readers: &#8220;How the money is spent is kept deliberately opaque by the authorities.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Actually, it is not difficult to find a great deal of information about how Denmark&#8217;s money is spent. Much of it can be gotten from the <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SNA_TABLE11\" type=\"external\">OECD&#8217;s website</a>.</p> \n\n<p>So we get that Mr. Booth doesn&#8217;t like Denmark. He tells readers that the food and weather are awful. That may be true, but his analysis of other aspects of Danish society doesn&#8217;t fit with the data.</p> \n\n<p>Economist Dean Baker is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, DC.

They know government is on a morbid obesity diet and we&#8217;ve got to rein in the spending.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Bachmann&#8217;s remarks came at a tea party rally in&amp;#160;Sarasota,&amp;#160;Florida on Sunday. Hurricane Irene was thankfully <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">not as bad</a> as it could have been (and the earthquake wasn&#8217;t very bad at all), but it still took an enormous economic toll on the East Coast and has caused serious flooding in upstate New York and Vermont, which are not part of Washington. The wisdom of using it as a political bludgeon is questionable to say the least.</p> \n\n<p>But it&#8217;s also kind of an odd point to make. Congress is in recess for the month of August, and about a fifth of the chamber is <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">actually in&amp;#160;Israel</a> right now. President Obama was out of town as well. The &#8220;politicians,&#8221; of which&amp;#160;Bachamnn is one, were for the most part not affected by the storm.

After more than a decade of drama, Trump&#8217;s name is being stripped from a 65-story hotel and condo building in downtown Toronto, following years of financial failure and lawsuits. In the end, the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Toronto has become yet another symbol of the flaws of the Trump business empire: construction setbacks, strange financing, angry investors, and empty hotel rooms.</p> \n\n<p>Trump first made his move into Canada at the height of his&amp;#160;Apprentice deal-making fame, inking an agreement&amp;#160;to attach his name&#8212;and reputation&#8212;to a shiny new Toronto tower, in which he had no ownership interest. When the building&amp;#160;opened five years ago, Trump kicked off the project with a bit of promotion that looks a lot like the PR strategy he would employ as a candidate and as president: a&amp;#160;tweet with a dramatic video of his plane landing and a black motorcade of SUVs rolling into the hotel&#8217;s entrance, where an adoring crowd waited.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>In the 2012&amp;#160;video&#8212;after a montage of the future commander-in-chief examining bathrooms and piles of merchandise set to jazzy trumpet music&#8212;Trump took the podium and declared, &#8220;About eight years ago I began this voyage, and it turned out to be a beautiful voyage, because the end result is this spectacular building.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The beautiful voyage did not last. The Toronto tower he leased his name to never lived up to the hype. On Tuesday morning, the Trump Organization and the building&#8217;s current owner announced that the president&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-27/trump-hotel-owner-in-toronto-reaches-deal-to-remove-trump-brand\" type=\"external\">name will be removed from the hotel</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Trump spent years promoting the property as a total success and an extension of his brand. His original partners in the project were two Russian-Canadian businessmen, neither of whom had any experience with building a skyscraper. As the building went up, construction delays and other problems&#8212;including <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/glass-falls-from-trump-tower/article5306888/\" type=\"external\">pieces of the building falling off&#8212;</a>set the project back.</p> \n\n<p>The building was to be financed through a scheme&#8212;used in other Trump projects, such as the Trump Soho in New York City&#8212;in which investors bought individual units and signed an agreement allowing them to be rented out through the Trump-managed hotel. In return for providing money upfront for the construction, these owners would enjoy a slice of the profits when their rooms were filled by hotel customers.</p> \n\n<p>Trump agreed to manage the hotel once the building was complete, but <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/02/08/513946283/trump-tower-in-toronto-is-up-for-sale-and-facing-legal-woes\" type=\"external\">lawsuits from investors</a> charged that Trump and his partners had misled them&amp;#160;about his role in the building.</p> \n\n<p>These investor lawsuits were not unique to Trump&#8217;s Toronto deal. He battled similar actions in relation to&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/us/politics/donald-trump-soho-settlement.html?_r=0\" type=\"external\">Trump Soho</a>&amp;#160;and other properties. In these cases, investors complained that they had been misled by the promotional material and sales teams that&amp;#160;pitched the deals as successful Trump-led projects. (Trump <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/05/23/trump-lawsuit-chicago/2355929/\" type=\"external\">prevailed</a> in one such high-profile case in 2013.)</p> \n\n<p>The majority of the Toronto building&#8217;s units remained unsold. (Some investors who had bought units prior to construction later backed out after the 2008 economic crisis.) Trump&#8217;s partners then turned to another source of financing. One of those partners, Alexander Shnaider, owned a stake in a Ukrainian steel mill; he sold it in 2010 and used some of the estimated $850 million in proceeds to prop up the Trump Toronto project. The buyer at the other end of the Ukrainian steel mill deal? A Russian state-owned bank known to have close ties to Vladimir Putin and now on the list of financial institutions under sanction by the US government. (In May, the Wall Street Journal&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-state-run-bank-financed-deal-involving-trump-hotel-partner-1495031708\" type=\"external\">reported</a>&amp;#160;that this deal has become a subject of interest for US investigators probing Trump&#8217;s potential connections with Russia.)</p> \n\n<p>The extra financing, though, wasn&#8217;t enough, and the building remained troubled. This past November, shortly after the US election, Trump&#8217;s Canadian partners <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-10-26/trump-hotel-in-toronto-nears-auction-after-default-by-developer\" type=\"external\">lost control of the building</a>. It was the new owner, JCF Capital, that&amp;#160;announced Tuesday&amp;#160;that it was cutting ties with the Trump Organization. Given the building&#8217;s checkered history and the hotel&#8217;s struggle to succeed under Trump management, such a move made sense. Since Trump&#8217;s election, protesters in Toronto have homed&amp;#160;in on the property as the target of their ire. Recent searches of hotel booking websites show rooms there being offered at steep discounts.</p> \n\n<p>According to Bloomberg, JCF Capital <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-27/trump-hotel-owner-in-toronto-reaches-deal-to-remove-trump-brand\" type=\"external\">may have paid as much as $6 million</a> to ditch the Trump name. But Trump will lose a valuable revenue stream. According to the three personal financial disclosures he has filed since first announcing his candidacy, Trump has earned more than half a million dollars per year for the last three years in management fees, though he reported that&amp;#160;his fees had fallen&amp;#160;in the past year. (Trump&#8217;s adult sons have assumed daily control of the Trump Organization, but Trump still retains near complete ownership of the business and almost all its assets.)</p> \n\n<p>The collapse of the Toronto business is the latest in a series of hits to Trump&#8217;s high-end luxury hotel empire. Questions have been raised by former employees <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-21/trump-russia-and-those-shadowy-sater-deals-at-bayrock\" type=\"external\">about the source of financing of the&amp;#160;</a>the Trump Soho, which Trump once owned&amp;#160;a stake in but now only manages.&amp;#160;Recently, that hotel reportedly <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/24/new-yorks-trump-soho-hotel-is-reportedly-planning-to-lay-off-staff.html\" type=\"external\">laid off staff</a> and shuttered a high-end restaurant following a post-election slump in business. A new Trump-managed golf course in New York City <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/nyregion/trump-golf-course-bronx.html\" type=\"external\">has had its business decline in the past year</a>, and several other Trump properties, including his beloved Mar-a-Lago,&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-banquet-business-was-booming-at-mar-a-lago-then-trump-became-president/2017/06/23/1f50cf28-5145-11e7-b064-828ba60fbb98_story.html\" type=\"external\">have suffered as well</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Last week,&amp;#160;Mother Jones <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">reported</a> that Trump condo sales seem to be slumping, with large cuts in the listing prices for several prominent Trump-owned units in New York City.

Anti-LGBT violence and discrimination in El Salvador is among the LGBT-specific issues the commission examined last week.</p> \n\n<p>El Salvador, which borders Guatemala and Honduras, has one of the world&#8217;s highest murder rates. Anti-LGBT rhetoric from politicians and religious figures, discrimination, poverty and a lack of educational opportunities are among the factors that have made LGBT Salvadorans particularly vulnerable to violence.</p> \n\n<p>A report from El Salvador&#8217;s Attorney for the Defense of Human Rights indicates 52 percent of trans women it surveyed said they received death threats. A press release the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights released on March 23 indicates 17 of the more than 40 reports of &#8220;serious crimes&#8221; against LGBT people that have been committed in the Western Hemisphere so far this year come from El Salvador.</p> \n\n<p>Rodr&#237;guez said trans women&#8217;s family members frequently commit acts of violence against them because of their gender identity. She also told the commission that gang members routinely extort money from those who engage in sex work.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We find ourselves in a cycle of violence, discrimination and criminalization,&#8221; said Rodr&#237;guez.</p> \n\n<p>Rodr&#237;guez and others who testified at the hearing said LGBT rights advocates in El Salvador are frequently threatened and attacked.</p> \n\n<p>Ambar Alfaro of ASPIDH Arcoiris said an activist was carjacked last October as she left a San Salvador mall and held against her will for nearly an hour.

Espacio de Mujeres Lesbianas por la Diversidad (ESMULES) Executive Director Andrea Ayala told the Blade during <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">a previous interview</a> that she suspects police officers broke into her office after she and other advocates publicly denounced the attack.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The state has not adopted any type of measures that protect us and guarantee that we can do our work without risk,&#8221; said Alfaro.</p> \n\n<p>Avelar did not attend the hearing because she was unable to obtain a visa that would have allowed her to travel to the U.S.</p> \n\n<p>Representatives of the Salvadoran government who testified at the hearing defended the country&#8217;s efforts to combat anti-LGBT violence and discrimination.</p> \n\n<p>Cruz Torres, director of the Office of Diversity in El Salvador&#8217;s Ministry of Social Inclusion, noted he specifically works on LGBT issues. He also pointed out the country&#8217;s government has directed public agencies to stop discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.</p> \n\n<p>Salvadoran lawmakers in 2015 approved an amendment to the country&#8217;s legal code that enhances penalties for anti-LGBT hate crimes.</p> \n\n<p>Three of the five police officers who Pe&#241;a accused of attacking him were convicted last October and were sentenced to prison.

To offset those losses, Qualcomm <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/08/11/qualcomm-inc-is-running-out-of-room-to-grow-whats.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">aggressively expanded Opens a New Window.</a>into Internet of Things (IoT) devices, drones, connected cameras, and connected cars.</p> \n\n<p>Prior to the NXP deal, Qualcomm acquired IoT and automotive chipmaker CSR for $2.4 billion last year, and launched a line of Snapdragon Automotive chips forinfotainment and navigation systems. Buying NXP (which expanded its automotive business by buying Freescale last year) will add a wide variety of automotive chips, along with the turnkey driverless platform BlueBox, to Qualcomm's portfolio.</p> \n\n<p>The exact impact of the merger will be hard to gauge until the deal is formally announced, but Qualcomm currently trades at fairly low multiples. Despite rallying 35% this year, Qualcomm still trades at 20 times earnings -- which is lower than the average P/E of 22 for broad line semiconductor companies.</p> \n\n<p>Baidu, the top search engine in China, announced inJune that it would put driverless cars on public roads within the next five years. Like its American counterpart, Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google, Baidu doesn't plan to mass produce the cars by itself. Instead, it plans to outsource the production to existing automakers, with the first Baidu-branded vehicle set to arrive in 2018. That vehicle will be a driverless shuttle bus programmed to run in a loop.</p> \n\n<p>Last December, Baidu started testing out its driverless technology on a fleet of BMW 3-Series GTs in Beijing and Wuhu. Earlier this year, Baidu established a driverless tech research center in Silicon Valley, with the goal of testing out autonomous cars in the U.S. in the near future.</p> \n\n<p>BMW 3-Series GT.

As ride-hailing apps and driverless cars both grow in popularity, they will likely converge with apps for hailing autonomous taxis.</p> \n\n<p>When that happens, Baidu's expansive ecosystem of search, maps, mobile payments, and O2O services could help it dominate the market by leveraging its users' dependence on those core services. While that ambitious goal might take years to reach, Baidu remains fairly cheap at 13 times earnings -- which is much lower than the industry average of P/E of 50 for internet information providers.</p> \n\n<p>Qualcomm and Baidu still trade at relatively low multiples because many investors are worried about their near-term headwinds. Qualcomm still faces tough competition in smartphone chips, and its higher-margin licensing business remains under pressure from defiant OEMs and government regulators. Baidu's margins have declined over the past few years due to its increased spending on new markets like O2O services and driverless cars.</p> \n\n<p>Investors are wise to question Qualcomm and Baidu's ability to clear those big hurdles, but they should also note that both companies are well-poised to capitalize on the growth of driverless cars. Moreover, their fairly low valuations indicate that they might have more upside growth potential than more richly valued driverless stocks like <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/05/22/better-driverless-car-stock-mobileye-nv-or-nvidi-2.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Nvidia and Mobileye Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Watters has admitted his infidelity which he only reported to Fox News human resources after the divorce papers were filed. He and his now-estranged wife have twin six year old daughters.</p> \n\n<p>Most companies have strict prohibitions against employees engaging in romantic relationships with subordinates on their staff. Generally it mandates termination of the superior employee who is in a position to abuse their power. Presumably, Fox News has the same policy. However, the response by Fox upon discovery of the relationship was to transfer DiGiovine to another program and let Watters off the hook entirely.

Gee, Doanld Trump only paid $130,000 (that we know of). Fox and Friends anchor Ed Henry was suspended for several weeks for having an adulterous affair.

Honeybee populations across the country have declined sharply since last Fall. The California almond industry, supplying 80 percent of the world market of almonds, requires roughly half of the nation&#8217;s commercial hives to pollinate its groves. This ratio might see a dramatic change when new tallies on hives are available this Spring.</p> \n\n<p>Many beekeepers have seen Winter hive <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/14/AR2010031402600.html?hpid=artslot\" type=\"external\">losses</a> as high as 50 percent.

The phenomenon is characterized by a sudden drop in beehive populations as foraging bees fail to return to their hives. With one third of the nation&#8217;s crops pollinated by insects (the majority being honeybees), the newest reports from apiarists are not just troubling&amp;#160; for Californians.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>The current rate of bee disappearance is actually an uptick in an almost four year established trend. A new study claims that hive losses have stabilized at 30 percent per year. But that report doesn&#8217;t include this Winter&#8217;s data.

While some posit that a parasitic mite is to blame, others claim malnutrition or increased pesticide use is the source of the problem. The only consensus that has been reached: a multitude of factors are working to wipe out the bees.</p> \n\n<p>An almond industry insider said it is too soon to see if this year&#8217;s yields will be affected by the continuing decline in bee colonies.

John Kelly has been selected to head the Department of Homeland Security, and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a climate-change denier whose policies have helped fossil fuel companies, is to be announced as head of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p> \n\n<p>Separately, Trump named the former chief executive of World Wrestling Entertainment, Linda McMahon, to head the Small Business Administration &#8212; and may have breathed new life into the candidacy of a secretary of state contender.</p> \n\n<p>Trump said he planned to name his choice for the key Cabinet post next week and insisted that former rival Mitt Romney still had a chance. Trump, who has met twice with the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, denied he was stringing Romney along to make him pay for earlier remarks that Trump was unfit to be president.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not about revenge. It&#8217;s about what&#8217;s good for the country, and I&#8217;m able to put this stuff behind us &#8212; and I hit him very hard also,&#8221; Trump said in a telephone interview on NBC.</p> \n\n<p>Three sources close to the selection process said late Wednesday that Romney&#8217;s stock is on the rise again within Trump&#8217;s circle after a period in which the celebrity businessman had cooled on the candidacy of the former Massachusetts governor. But Trump has changed his mind repeatedly throughout the process and has expanded the pool of contenders beyond the previously identified final four of Romney, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker and former CIA Director David Petraeus.</p> \n\n<p>Trump&#8217;s long presidential campaign was in large part defined by searing rhetoric and his steadfast promises to build an impenetrable wall on the border with Mexico and crack down on immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. But he struck a softer tone in an interview published Wednesday after he was named Time Magazine&#8217;s &#8220;Person of the Year.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to work something out that&#8217;s going to make people happy and proud,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;They got brought here at a very young age; they&#8217;ve worked here, they&#8217;ve gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they&#8217;re in never-never land because they don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He offered no details about a policy that would make that clear.</p> \n\n<p>During the campaign, Trump&#8217;s tough comments &#8212; including a vow to overturn President Barack Obama&#8217;s executive orders on immigration &#8212; have led to fears among immigrant advocates that he will end Obama&#8217;s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Hundreds of thousands of young immigrants have gained work permits and temporary protection from deportation under the 2012 program, which aides to Trump have said would be revisited.</p> \n\n<p>Others continue to press the immigrants&#8217; case. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel presented Trump a letter Wednesday from 14 big city mayors urging him to keep the program intact.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;They were working hard toward the American dream,&#8221; Emmanuel told reporters in lobby of Trump&#8217;s skyscraper. &#8220;It&#8217;s no fault of their own their parents came here. They are something we should hold up and embrace.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Though some immigrant advocates hope Trump&#8217;s words were an olive branch, others were skeptical.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen this movie before,&#8221; Frank Sharry of the immigrant-rights group America&#8217;s Voice said in a statement. &#8220;Unfortunately we expect no pivot and no softening.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Meanwhile, Trump moved toward making another addition to the collection of generals in his Cabinet, settling on Kelly to head Homeland Security, according to people close to transition. Gen. Kelly, who joined the Marine Corps in 1970, retired this year after a final command that included oversight of the Guantanamo Bay detention center.</p> \n\n<p>He has a reputation as a border hawk after a time in the Southern Command, which is based in South Florida and regularly works with Homeland Security on missions to identify and dismantle immigrant smuggling networks.</p> \n\n<p>Trump also picked Pruitt, a longtime critic of the EPA, to head that same agency, according to person close to Pruitt who was not authorized to speak publicly about the choice before it was announced. The move comes just after Trump met with former Vice President Al Gore, who is an environmental activist, and said he had &#8220;an open mind&#8221; about honoring the Paris climate accords.</p> \n\n<p>That gave hope to some environmentalists, but on Wednesday Trump&#8217;s apparent decision was denounced by Democrats.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Mr. Pruitt&#8217;s record is not only that of being a climate change denier, but also someone who has worked closely with the fossil fuel industry to make this country more dependent, not less, on fossil fuels,&#8221; said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.</p> \n\n<p>But Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, a Republican, said Pruitt &#8220;has proven that being a good steward of the environment does not mean burdening taxpayers and businesses with red tape.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The president-elect also announced his selection of Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad as the new U.S. ambassador to China. Trump and Branstad are expected to appear together in Iowa on Thursday.</p> \n\n<p>Before that, Trump will meet with some of the victims of last week&#8217;s car-and-knife attack at Ohio State University.

The idea was again advanced by Mattis as an important goal of the UN Security Council; but such matters remain the stuff of nonsense.&amp;#160; Having struck gold, a person is hardly going to relinquish it.&amp;#160; The nuclear weapon remains Kim&#8217;s best insurance policy, his plumage of warning.

FactCheck.org and PolitiFact have covered the facts, and we wrote about the deal briefly in a speech roundup. But with the renewed attention this month, we decided to take a deeper look at Clinton&#8217;s role in this deal.</p> \n\n<p>&#8212;</p> \n\n<p>The deal</p> \n\n<p>The Trump campaign pointed to an April 2015 New York Times article about this deal, based on a preview of &#8220;Clinton Cash.&#8221; The Times said it &#8220;scrutinized his [Schweizer&#8217;s] information and built upon it with its own reporting.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>The story starts with Frank Giustra, a Canadian mining financier and donor to the Clinton Foundation; Giustra&#8217;s company, UrAsia; and Uranium One, a uranium mining company headquartered in Toronto.</p> \n\n<p>In 2007, Giustra sold UrAsia to Uranium One, which was based in South Africa and chaired by his friend, Ian Telfer. Giustra said he sold his personal stake in the deal in fall 2007, shortly after the merger with Uranium One, in the midst of Clinton&#8217;s 2008 presidential campaign and before Clinton realized Barack Obama would win the nomination and she would become his secretary of state.</p> \n\n<p>In 2009, Russia&#8217;s nuclear energy agency, Rosatom, began buying shares in Uranium One as a part of a larger move to acquire mines around the world. Rosatom first bought a 17 percent share of Uranium One, which has holdings in the United States. In 2010, the Russians sought to increase their share to 51 percent. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the deal. In 2013, Russia assumed 100 percent ownership.</p> \n\n<p>The deal gave Russia control of about 20 percent of U.S. uranium extraction capacity, according to a 2010 CNN article about the deal. In other words, Russia has rights to the uranium extracted at those sites, which represents 20 percent of the U.S. uranium production capacity.</p> \n\n<p>Clinton&#8217;s role</p> \n\n<p>The State Department was one of nine agencies comprising CFIUS, which vets potential national security impacts of transactions where a foreign government gains control of a U.S. company. It was established by Congress in 2007 after the controversy over the planned purchase of seaports by a company in United Arab Emirates. The other agencies were the departments of Treasury, Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security, and two White House agencies (Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and Office of Science and Technology Policy).</p> \n\n<p>The CFIUS can approve a deal, but only the president can suspend or stop a transaction. If the committee can&#8217;t come to a consensus, a member can recommend a suspension or prohibition of the deal, and the president makes the call.</p> \n\n<p>Due to confidentiality laws, there are few details made public about the deal or about Clinton&#8217;s role in it, factcheck.org found. The Clinton campaign said Clinton herself was not involved in the State Department&#8217;s review and did not direct the department to take any position on the sale of Uranium One. Matters of the CFIUS did not rise to the level of the secretary, the campaign said.</p> \n\n<p>Jose Fernandez, then-assistant secretary of state for economic, energy and business affairs, sat on the committee. Fernandez told the Times: &#8220;Mrs. Clinton never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter.&#8221; Fernandez did not respond to our requests for comment.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Hillary&#8217;s opposition [to the Uranium One deal] would have been enough under CFIUS rules to have the decision on the transaction kicked up to the president. That never happened,&#8221; Schweizer wrote in &#8220;Clinton Cash.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>At the time the sale was underway, the Obama administration was attempting to &#8220;reset&#8221; its relations with Russia, with Clinton leading the effort as secretary of state. But there is no evidence approval of the sale was connected to the reset policy. The national security concern that the United States faced when CFIUS considered the deal concerned American dependence on foreign uranium sources, the Times reported.</p> \n\n<p>Yet the Uranium One deal was not on the radar of Michael McFaul, even though he was aware of many CFIUS cases in his role as the National Security Council&#8217;s senior director for Russian and Eurasian affairs from 2009 to 2012 (and as a prime architect of the administration&#8217;s reset policy). McFaul, now senior fellow at Stanford University&#8217;s Hoover Institution, said Fernandez could not &#8220;dictate the outcome of any decision single-handedly,&#8221; as he was one of nine members.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Knowing how the CFIUS process works and how the bureaucracy at the State Department works, I cannot imagine that such an issue would be reviewed by the secretary of state. there is a hierarchy in place precisely to protect the secretary&#8217;s time for only the most important of issues and meetings,&#8221; McFaul said.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I was not personally involved because that wasn&#8217;t something the secretary of state did,&#8221; Clinton told a New Hampshire TV station in June 2015.</p> \n\n<p>Some Republican lawmakers in 2010 did raise concerns about the deal &#8211; but they sent their letter to then-Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. (Treasury chairs the CFIUS.) Final approval was given by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which noted the mines would remain under the control of U.S. subsidies. &#8220;Neither Uranium One nor ARMZ [the Russian firm] holds an NRC export license, so no uranium produced at either facility may be exported,&#8221; the NRC said. (Some uranium yellowcake is extracted, processed in Canada and returned to the United States.)</p> \n\n<p>We asked the Trump campaign for evidence that Clinton or the State Department had more of a role in the deal than any of the eight other member agencies of CFIUS, and did not receive a response.</p> \n\n<p>Quid pro quo claims</p> \n\n<p>Did the Clintons get paid for the Russian deal? The Trump campaign pointed to donations to the Clinton Foundation, as reported by the Times. Giustra became friends with Bill Clinton in 2005, over their charity work. The Washington Post took an in-depth look at their ties and described their friendship as one &#8220;that has helped propel the Clinton Foundation into a global giant and established Giustra&#8217;s reputation as an international philanthropist while helping him build connections in countries where his business was expanding.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Giustra eventually became one of the largest individual donors to the Clinton Foundation. His relationship with the Clintons came under scrutiny over donors to the Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership (Canada), which raises money for the similarly-named Clinton Giustra Enterprise Partnership, one of Clinton Foundation&#8217;s initiatives.</p> \n\n<p>Individuals related to Uranium One and UrAsia, including Giustra and Telfer, donated to the Clinton Foundation, totaling about $145 million. The Times reported that Telfer also donated to the Clinton Foundation using his family charity based in Canada. These were donations made to the Clinton Foundation, not directly to the Clintons.</p> \n\n<p>As PolitiFact found, the majority of these donations were made before and during Clinton&#8217;s 2008 presidential run. So Trump&#8217;s claim that Hillary Clinton &#8220;gave [uranium to] Russia for a big payment&#8221; is not accurate. If she had actually become president, she would have had more power over the deal than as the head of one agency among nine represented on CFIUS.</p> \n\n<p>The Trump campaign also noted that Bill Clinton received speaking fees while the Uranium One deal was underway. After the Russians announced that they would acquire stakes in Uranium One, and while the Kremlin was promoting the purchase, Bill Clinton received $500,000 in 2010 for a speech in Moscow from a Russian investment bank that had ties to the Kremlin. Putin personally thanked Clinton, the Wall Street Journal reported, adding that a review of Bill Clinton&#8217;s speeches &#8220;found no evidence that speaking fees were paid to the former president in exchange for any action by Mrs. Clinton.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The Times also did not report a direct link between Bill Clinton and the deal. The bank&#8217;s analysts talked up Uranium One&#8217;s stock while the deal was under CFIUS consideration, and assigned it a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating. The bank &#8220;would not comment on the genesis of Mr. Clinton&#8217;s speech to an audience that included leading Russian officials, or on whether it was connected to the Rosatom deal,&#8221; the Times reported.</p> \n\n<p>&#8212;</p> \n\n<p>Trump and his campaign claim that Clinton &#8220;gave&#8221; or &#8220;handed over&#8221; 20 percent of American uranium rights to the Russians. Through the Uranium One deal, the Russian state-owned nuclear energy company does now have control over 20 percent of U.S. uranium extraction capacity. But it cannot export the uranium.</p> \n\n<p>In 2010, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States approved the sale of the majority of the shares to the Russians. The State Department was one of nine agencies on the committee that approved the deal. The deal was also separately approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</p> \n\n<p>There is no evidence Clinton herself got involved in the deal personally, and it is highly questionable that this deal even rose to the level of the secretary of state. Theoretically, as Schweizer says, Clinton could have intervened. But even then, it ultimately would have been Obama&#8217;s decision whether to suspend or block the deal.</p> \n\n<p>Trump so often uses broad-brushed language that pushes him into greater untrue territory, and this is yet another one of those cases. He specifically names Hillary Clinton as the active agent in the Uranium One deal, saying she &#8220;gave them&#8221; or &#8220;handed over&#8221; uranium to the Russians, but that is not the case. Then, he further claimed the sale went forward in exchange &#8220;for a big payment.&#8221; There&#8217;s no evidence for that claim either.</p> \n\n<p>Trump could have avoided an untrue rating had he been more careful with the language. For example: &#8220;Hillary Clinton&#8217;s State Department was one of nine agencies that approved the deal.&#8221; Words matter.</p> \n\n<p>trump-factcheck</p>", "title": "Fact Checker: The facts behind Donald Trump\u2019s repeated claim about Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in the Russian uranium deal", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/875279/fact-checker-the-facts-behind-donald-trumps-repeated-claim-about-hillary-clintons-role-in-the-russian-uranium-deal.html", "published_at": "", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>Chris Matthews, host of MSNBC's Hardball, displayed some faux modesty Monday night when <a href=\"http://www.freedomworks.org/matt-kibbe\" type=\"external\">Freedomworks CEO Matt Kibbe</a> suggested the recent drop in <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=0CDgQFjAC&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fpoliticalticker.blogs.cnn.com%2F2013%2F10%2F16%2Fpoll-tea-partys-favorable-numbers-take-a-hit%2F&amp;amp;ei=r_VlUpv_EujSiALo5YD4Cg&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNEYVQFc-mKwQ7f4FzkVh5ja4EOsTg&amp;amp;bvm=bv.55123115,d.cGE\" type=\"external\">Tea Party opinion polls</a> just may have resulted from the excessive bias permeating throughout MSNBC and the mainstream media itself.

Atlanta-based UPS Inc. maintained that it obeyed the law because it provided light-work duty only in limited situations and did not single out pregnant women.</p> \n\n<p>But in ordering lower courts to look again at Young&#8217;s claim, Justice Stephen Breyer said for the court that one consideration should be, &#8220;Why, when the employer accommodated so many, could it not accommodate pregnant women as well?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>UPS said it did not provide light-duty work to any employees unless they were injured on the job, had a condition that was covered by the Americans With Disabilities Act or lost their federal certificate to drive a commercial vehicle.</p> \n\n<p>Justice Antonin Scalia said in dissent that the majority waved &#8220;the Supreme Wand&#8221; to arrive at the outcome it preferred. Scalia said the law &#8220;does not prohibit denying pregnant women accommodations, or any other benefit for that matter, on the basis of an evenhanded policy.&#8221; Justices Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas joined the dissent.</p> \n\n<p>The outcome reflects a &#8220;middle ground&#8221; that Justice Elena Kagan suggested during arguments in early December. Courts must now re-examine Young&#8217;s case with a more accepting view of the discrimination claim. UPS and other employers facing similar suits still are able to argue their policies were legal because they were based on seniority or some other acceptable reason.</p> \n\n<p>UPS has since changed its policy and now says it will try to accommodate pregnant workers. Nine states also have adopted laws directing employers to do so.</p> \n\n<p>In recent months, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has updated guidance to employers to make clear that they should accommodate people in Young&#8217;s situation. Yet the U.S. Postal Service said it has made no change in policy and maintains the practice that UPS has now abandoned.</p> \n\n<p>Pregnant workers in situations similar to Young&#8217;s also may have additional protections under 2008 amendments to the Americans with Disabilities Act. Young&#8217;s pregnancy occurred before Congress changed the disabilities law.</p> \n\n<p>Women&#8217;s rights groups and Young&#8217;s lawyers praised the decision. &#8220;We think it&#8217;s a big win for Peggy Young. We think it&#8217;s a big win for pregnant workers around the country,&#8221; said Samuel Bagenstos, Young&#8217;s lawyer at the Supreme Court.</p> \n\n<p>UPS spokeswoman Susan Rosenberg said the court did not embrace Young&#8217;s argument that UPS&#8217; policy was discriminatory and instead ordered lower court review under a standard that neither side argued for at the Supreme Court.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We are confident that those courts will find that UPS did not discriminate against Ms. Young under this newly announced standard,&#8221; Rosenberg said.</p> \n\n<p>Young&#8217;s dispute with UPS arose after she became pregnant through in-vitro fertilization and gave her supervisor a doctor&#8217;s note recommending that she not lift packages heavier than 20 pounds. Young, now 43, said she dealt almost exclusively with overnight letters, but UPS said its drivers must be able to lift packages weighing up to 70 pounds. She returned to work two months after her daughter, Triniti, was born. Young left the company in 2009.</p> \n\n<p>The Virginia woman lost two rounds in lower courts.

It can be difficult to never sell, especially when times seem dire -- but if you can pick companies with durable competitive advantages, you should be able to sleep at night and avoid pressing the panic \"sell\" button.</p> \n\n<p>Here are four Motley Fool contributors with companies that they recommend never selling: International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), Allergan (NYSE: AGN), Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), and Boeing Co. (NYSE: BA).</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFBargainBin/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Tim Green Opens a New Window.</a>: Every stock that I buy I intend to hold for years. Ideally, a stock will produce exceptional returns indefinitely, never requiring me to sell. Things change, of course, and investors can't be afraid to sell a stock if their thesis has been turned upside down. But in general, the longer the holding period, the better.</p> \n\n<p>Predicting how technology will evolve is hard, if not impossible, and that makes committing to holding a technology stock indefinitely risky. But International Business Machines, a company that has been around for a century, is one tech stock that I'm comfortable holding for a long time. The company has transformed itself on multiple occasions during its lifetime, shifting from mechanical tabulating machines to computers, then transitioning into a software and services company, and now throwing its weight behind cloud and cognitive computing.</p> \n\n<p>Transitions are always painful, and the current one IBM is undergoing is no exception. Revenue has been declining for years, and earnings are being pressured as the company shifts resources from legacy businesses to areas that offer the most potential. There's no guarantee that IBM will succeed, but if I'm going to be holding a tech stock for a very long time, a company with a long history of adaptation makes the most sense.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFGBudwell/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">George Budwell Opens a New Window.</a>: There aren't many stocks I would absolutely never sell, but specialty pharma Allergan is an exception to the rule. The short story is that Allergan is currently in the process of shedding its generic-drug business to focus on branded products like the double-chin treatment Kybella, and the IBS drugs Linzess and Viberzi, among many others. As a result, the health of the drugmaker's balance sheet has improved dramatically in the last few months, with the company already retiring $9 billion in debt this year. And Allergan's recent double-digit top-line growth appears to be sustainable for the long haul, given that the drugmaker is in the midst of multiple new product launches at the moment.</p> \n\n<p>Having said that, Allergan's penchant for wheeling and dealing is an area of concern. So far, management has carefully guided the company through multiple acquisitions that have led to an overall healthier enterprise. However, one bad deal in the pharmaceutical industry can hamper a company's growth for a decade or more. That's why I would personally prefer for Allergan to pay off even more debt, and perhaps sit tight for the time being, instead of rushing out to spend its recent windfall from the sale of its generic unit. But this is Allergan, after all, meaning that a monstrous acquisition is almost certainly coming down the pike soon. So, hopefully, management can continue their winning ways by adding yet another value-creating asset to the company's already strong product portfolio of branded medicines. Stay tuned.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFmd19/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Matt DiLallo Opens a New Window.</a>: Midstream pipeline giant Enterprise Products Partners has been a part of my portfolio since 2007. I plan on keeping it right where it is, and adding to my position over time, because I view it as an anchor income holding. It is a decision that paid off very well in the past, and one that I expect will continue for many years to come.</p> \n\n<p>What drew me toward Enterprise Products Partners was its eye-popping yield, which at the time of <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/08/27/the-secret-to-buying-high-yield-stocks.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">my initial investment Opens a New Window.</a> was just shy of 7%. However, since my first purchase, the distribution has gone up every single quarter. Because of that, the yield on my initial investment is now more than 11.5%.</p> \n\n<p>Three factors drive Enterprise's ability to grow the payout. First, it primarily owns fee-based assets that are under long-term contracts, so it generates rather stable cash flow. Second, unlike most master limited partnerships, it does not distribute all of its cash flow back to investors; instead, it retains a substantial portion to reinvest into growth projects, including $5.3 billion since 2011. Finally, the company continues to construct a steady stream of fee-based assets that drive cash-flow growth; currently, it has $5.6 billion of projects under construction to drive growth through 2018.</p> \n\n<p>With a solid foundation and ample running room for future growth, Enterprise Products Partners is one company that I have no desire to sell.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFTwoCoins/info.aspx\" type=\"external\">Daniel Miller Opens a New Window.</a>: Investors hopping off the Boeing Co. bandwagon could be forgiven, especially after a rough second quarter, when the aviation juggernaut took almost $3 billion in pre-tax charges from its 787, 747 and KC-46 tanker programs. However, despite the rough quarter, Boeing still has durable comparable advantages with its commercial and defense businesses, which make it a stock you shouldn't sell.</p> \n\n<p>Boeing operates in an intensely regulated commercial aircraft industry, so it's extremely difficult for new competitors to enter the market, leaving Boeing and Airbus to dominate the area. There are very real barriers to entry imposed by the knowledge and experience required to develop, design, assemble and certify commercial aircraft; that isn't changing any time soon, which is great news for investors willing to stick around for the long haul.</p> \n\n<p>Another bonus is that over the past five years, Boeing has increasingly focused on returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, as you can see below:</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://ycharts.com/companies/BA/shares_outstanding\" type=\"external\">BA Shares Outstanding</a> data by <a href=\"http://ycharts.com\" type=\"external\">YCharts Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>And despite being in a cyclical industry, Boeing has more than $470 billion worth of orders in its combined commercial and defense backlog, which is roughly five years' worth of revenue transparency. On top of that, Boeing made the decision to incrementally improve both the 737 and 777 programs, rather than develop all-new aircraft, which should generate more cash flow and increase its return on invested capital.</p> \n\n<p>The downside with Boeing is that the company operates in a cyclical industry, which guarantees turbulence at some point, and when operational mistakes happen they cost a pretty penny see Boeing's second quarter. But any company that operates in an industry with steep barriers to entry and has a history of returning value to shareholders is a company you shouldn't sell anytime soon.</p> \n\n<p>A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

But contradictions from Trump are a dime a dozen.</p> \n\n<p>A closer examination shows a deeper pattern of remarkable consistency in U.S. policy toward Syria that is far more critical than the perennial contradictions of politicians like Trump.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>To summarize U.S. actions and non-actions in terms of direct publicly announced U.S. air attacks targeting the Syrian regime: In 2013, when Assad was losing the war, Obama refrained from strikes that may well have ended his regime. Now, four years later, when Assad seems close to winning the war, Trump with a revamped NSC does a 180 on his previous pronouncements and attacks Assad.</p> \n\n<p>Push away the personalities. Dispense with the rhetoric. Free yourself from the spin cycle that much of the media obsess over. Just follow the policy.</p> \n\n<p>The evidence is that the underlying U.S. policy &#8212; whether the president is Obama or Trump &#8212; is to prolong the Syrian war as much as possible. Let Assad off the hook when he&#8217;s cornered, hit him when he&#8217;s about to win.</p> \n\n<p>This would not at all be unprecedented. Through the 1980s, the U.S. backed both sides in the Iran-Iraq War, which resulted in horrific carnage. See Dahlia Wasfi&#8217;s piece from 2015 &#8212; &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/battling-isis-iran-iraq-war-redux-1538117706\" type=\"external\">Battling ISIS: Iran-Iraq war redux</a>&#8221; &#8212; which argued that &#8220;Obama&#8217;s unofficial strategy to fight ISIS may be that of Reagan&#8217;s for Iran and Iraq in the 1980s: a long, drawn-out war to strengthen U.S.-Israeli hegemony in the region.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Since the Arab uprisings of 2011, we&#8217;ve seen a series of actions by the U.S. government and its allies and clients &#8212; from Israel and Saudi Arabia in particular &#8212; to ensure the destruction of secular, at times independent Arab governments.</p> \n\n<p>Many obsess over &#8220;double standards&#8221; and apparent contradictions by Trump, Obama, Clinton and other political figures. But much of this analysis presumes that these political figures have stated what their actual goals are.</p> \n\n<p>But a president can&#8217;t come forward and publicly say that the goal is the continuation of the war in Syria. That would be to embrace the carnage and suffering that the policy causes. The president can&#8217;t just say we&#8217;re in cahoots with the authoritarian Israeli and Saudi regimes to keep countries like Iraq, Syria and Libya in turmoil.</p> \n\n<p>So, politicians claim they are acting to save human life or to stop weapons proliferation or whatever their pretext is. Then, because it&#8217;s not their actual reasons, people see what seem like contractions: &#8220;They don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing!&#8221; &#8220;He&#8217;s such an idiot!&#8221; But they are not really contradictions, they just highlight that the stated goals are not the actual goals.</p> \n\n<p>Except at times. Trump did say <a href=\"http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2015/09/16/cnn-reagan-library-debate-later-debate-full-transcript/\" type=\"external\">in a high profile debate</a> in September, 2015: &#8220;ISIS wants to fight Syria. Why are we fighting ISIS in Syria? Let them fight each other and pick up the remnants.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>And this gruesome notion is occasionally brought up in the establishment media in more polite terms. In 2013, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/world/middleeast/israel-backs-limited-strike-against-syria.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0\" type=\"external\">the New York Times reported on</a> how Israel viewed the prospect of Obama bombing Assad&#8217;s forces:</p> \n\n<p>Israelis have increasingly argued that the best outcome for Syria&#8217;s two-and-a-half-year-old civil war, at least for the moment, is no outcome.</p> \n\n<p>[For the Israeli government], the status quo, horrific as it may be from a humanitarian perspective, seems preferable to either a victory by Mr. Assad&#8217;s government and his Iranian backers or a strengthening of rebel groups, increasingly dominated by Sunni jihadis.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;This is a playoff situation in which you need both teams to lose, but at least you don&#8217;t want one to win &#8212; we&#8217;ll settle for a tie,&#8221; said Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli consul general in New York. &#8220;Let them both bleed, hemorrhage to death: that&#8217;s the strategic thinking here. As long as this lingers, there&#8217;s no real threat from Syria.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The synergy between the Israeli and American positions, while not explicitly articulated by the leaders of either country, could be a critical source of support as Mr. Obama seeks Congressional approval for surgical strikes in Syria.</p> \n\n<p>This notion <a href=\"http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/syriasource/syria-the-imperative-of-protecting-civilians\" type=\"external\">comes up</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/world/middleeast/obamas-uncertain-path-amid-syria-bloodshed.html\" type=\"external\">occasionally</a>.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s often claimed that &#8220;regime change&#8221; is the goal of the U.S., including by <a href=\"https://husseini.posthaven.com/crosstalk-lives-up-to-its-name\" type=\"external\">presumed critics of it</a>. But that might be too simple of an explanation. After all, the U.S. government sometimes claims this is its goal. At times the goal may well be not &#8220;regime change&#8221; but No Regime.</p> \n\n<p>Perhaps the U.S. establishments would like subservient leaders in Syria and Iraq and Libya. But these are significant counties with population, some resources and some capacity for independence. This is in contrast with Gulf sheikdoms and other monarchies like Jordan which are effectively client states of the U.S.</p> \n\n<p>So, if permanent subservience is not possible, then a crippled country, with the possibility of dismemberment, is a fairly good option for those intent on ensuring U.S.-Israel-Saudi dominance of the region. At least for the time being.</p> \n\n<p>Keep the fighting, keep the bleeding. Keep the people of the Mideast divided and fighting while the U.S. establishment solidifies its plans on how it will &#8220;pick up the remnants.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The phrase &#8220;Deep State&#8221; has been in vogue of late, as if it&#8217;s an entity that Donald Trump were out to undo even as he empowers it. But what does that really mean? A bureaucracy, perhaps. But more than anything, I think it&#8217;s an articulation of policy that the U.S. government pursues that dare not speak its name.</p> \n\n<p>Sam Husseini is founder of <a href=\"http://www.votepact.org/\" type=\"external\">VotePact.org</a>, which works for left-right cooperation.

The Times has now <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html?_r=0\" type=\"external\">followed up</a> with further on-the-record reports of sexual harassment from more women.</p> \n\n<p>Some of the women who spoke out did so anonymously, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/upshot/its-not-just-fox-why-women-dont-report-sexual-harassment.html\" type=\"external\">fearing retribution</a> from an extremely rich and powerful man with millions of dollars and high-profile connections at his disposal and a loudly and frequently discussed <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxwelltani/status/917767769558601729\" type=\"external\">penchant for personally attacking women he&#8217;s already attempted to victimize</a>. Others, including well-known actresses Ashley Judd, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Angelina Jolie, have also spoken on the record about Weinstein&#8217;s harassment. It is likely, given the nature of these accounts and the prevailing culture of dismissing and demeaning survivors, that more will choose to speak out, and still others will choose not to.</p> \n\n<p>The primary public conversation beginning to play out now is familiar: How has our culture -- in film, in politics, across all partisan divides -- allowed this violence to persist for so long? Why and how do our current systems work to keep women fearful and silent? Will any of it change? It remains to be seen if any of these questions will earn an answer, or whether they will, once again, fade back out of the spotlight, labeled as persistent, unsolvable issues. Nothing can be done to protect the vulnerable from the powerful, it seems.</p> \n\n<p>A secondary conversation is also emerging, centered more squarely on the media: What is the responsibility of journalists -- tasked with reporting the facts and acting in the public interest -- when they encounter serial interpersonal violence that&#8217;s been allowed to persist without public knowledge?</p> \n\n<p>The fact remains that journalists have a choice, every time: Do what can be done, following industry standards, to expose the truth and aide the powerless, or resort to becoming a tool for exploitation.</p> \n\n<p>The Weinstein reports -- and before them the Bill O&#8217;Reilly reports, the Roger Ailes reports, the Bill Cosby reports, the Woody Allen reports, the Roman Polanski reports, the Donald Trump reports, on and on -- have showcased these options repeatedly.</p> \n\n<p>The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/01/business/media/bill-oreilly-sexual-harassment-fox-news.html\" type=\"external\">doggedly reported</a> on multiple sexual harassment lawsuits against Fox News host Bill O&#8217;Reilly in April. Fox <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">fired</a> O&#8217;Reilly only when it was <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">finally forced to do so</a>. The network paid him <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/business/media/bill-oreilly-payout.html\" type=\"external\">$25 million</a> on the way out, then <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">invited him back</a> onto Hannity months later because it was scared of Rachel Maddow and, besides, O&#8217;Reilly had a <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">new book</a> to promote. O&#8217;Reilly also appeared on NBC&#8217;s Today for an <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">uncomfortable and unnecessary interview</a> with Matt Lauer in which he <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">attempted to publicly disparage a woman who had reported him</a>. He <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">referred</a> to an article on the right-wing site Newsmax.com, cross-posted to O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s personal website, that he touted as a redeeming investigation.</p> \n\n<p>Earlier, Fox also pushed out Roger Ailes when it was finally forced to do so. It handed the former Fox News chairman and CEO <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fox-roger-ailes-gretchen-carlson-payout_us_57cee12ce4b02c637c57d8b0\" type=\"external\">$40 million</a> as he left, and the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">people who enabled his serial harassment</a> simply closed ranks. <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">The culture didn&#8217;t change</a>. When Ailes died months later, he was fondly and emotionally eulogized on air, with no thoughtful discussion of his <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">real legacy</a> of hurting and silencing women.</p> \n\n<p>Like Weinstein&#8217;s behavior, Cosby&#8217;s violent misconduct was an &#8220; <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/i-warned-you-about-bill-cosby-in-2007\" type=\"external\">open secret</a>&#8221; in their industry, allowed to persist in part because society has taught us not to listen to women when they do come forward, and in part because women have been silenced by the culture around them and terrified of retaliation should they speak out. According to <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/media-enablers-harvey-weinstein-new-york-times/\" type=\"external\">one account</a>, actors Matt Damon and Russell Crowe may have personally worked to quash a 2004 New York Times article about Weinstein&#8217;s serial predatory misconduct. Weinstein also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxwelltani/status/917767769558601729\" type=\"external\">reportedly bragged</a> about placing negative articles about people who dared to speak out about him. Indeed, even as he issued his non-apology, Weinstein was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-harvey-weinstein/harvey-weinstein-threatens-to-sue-new-york-times-over-harassment-story-idUSKBN1CA2JX\" type=\"external\">threatening to sue</a> the Times.</p> \n\n<p>Just over a year ago, The Washington Post&#8217;s David Fahrenthold <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html\" type=\"external\">published</a> audio of President Donald Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women. NBC, then-employer of TV host Billy Bush who was also featured in the tape, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/10/17/media/billy-bush-leaves-nbc/index.html\" type=\"external\">subsequently fired Bush</a>. Network executives reportedly <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/trump-tape-nbc-news-access-hollywood-billy-bush-214344\" type=\"external\">knew about the tape</a> but&amp;#160;hadn&#8217;t reported on it yet, instead beat to the story by a competitor. (This week, Ronan Farrow wrote of new sexual assault and rape reports against Weinstein in The New Yorker -- though he is an NBC employee.) And in the months prior to the release of the Trump recording, television news writ large <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">remained virtually silent</a> on another report of sexual harassment and sexual assault committed by Trump.</p> \n\n<p>Responsible journalists recognize that serial sexual violence, particularly when perpetrated by society&#8217;s most powerful, is a difficult story to tell. Survivors are rightfully fearful of retribution, in keeping with the warped and disgusting power dynamic reaffirmed by the personal violence they&#8217;re already endured. They&#8217;re also often stymied by the culture of silence around sexual harassment and assault. The powerful people reported for misconduct -- frequently white, almost always men -- have the best lawyers their millions can buy. They have friends -- also frequently white, frequently men, always wealthy -- who will stand by them, defend them on TV, make movies with them, call newspapers to keep the story under wraps for another day.</p> \n\n<p>Reporters have a responsibility to report the truth, particularly when it challenges the abuse of power, with all available tools and at any cost. They have a responsibility to work against those abuses of power, giving voice to the voiceless without compromising their safety and sparing no question. They have a responsibility to afford no comfort to powerful men who have not earned protection, but instead have used their outsized power to steal that of others. Kudos to those doing this hard and crucial -- in fact, morally imperative -- work; they should be examples to the rest.</p>", "title": "Lesson of horrific Weinstein reports: Be a voice for the oppressed, or help the oppressors stay in power", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://mediamatters.org/blog/2017/10/10/lesson-horrific-weinstein-reports-be-voice-oppressed-or-help-oppressors-stay-power/218187", "published_at": "2017-10-10", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>George Zimmerman continues to play 'celebrity.'

At not-for-profit Florida Hospital, a retired general is developing global partnerships and leadership talent, while Finland's Cargotec Oyj has one running its rough-terrain-equipment unit in Texas.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Military brass have gained clout in the White House, too. Often referring to them as \"my generals,\" the president has tapped a trio of leaders to impose order and shape his national-security policy. Retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly swiftly brought a forceful management style to his job as the president's chief of staff, staffers say, while both Republicans and Democrats see Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and national security adviser H.R. McMaster as calming forces in a turbulent presidency.</p> \n\n<p>Discipline, though, is only one of the traits companies say military leaders bring to boards and management teams.</p> \n\n<p>In the fog of war, and in peacetime, generals are trained to anticipate unknown risks, build high-functioning teams and make quick, strategic decisions in high-pressure situations. \"They are the same traits necessary in the fog of business,\" says Henry Stoever, a captain in the Marine Corps who is now chief marketing officer of the National Association of Corporate Directors.</p> \n\n<p>The group has put some 500 retired generals and admirals through a three-day course to prepare them for corporate board duty; half of them now sit on private and public boards, including those of Wells Fargo &amp;amp; Co., USA Truck Inc. and aerospace supplier Wesco Aircraft Holdings Inc.</p> \n\n<p>Companies, especially those in crisis, covet the reputational boost that comes from seeking the counsel of a former military leader, says Wendy Monsen, president of executive recruiter Korn/Ferry's federal-government practice. Whereas more than three-quarters of Americans trust the military to act in the public's interest, according to a 2016 Pew Research Center survey, only 41% feel the same way about business leaders.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>For companies seeking cybersecurity skills or geopolitical know-how, \"general officers end up on our short list quite a bit for industry clients,\" says Ms. Monsen.</p> \n\n<p>However, outside the defense industry, military brass remain rare in c-suites and boardrooms. The number of top executives who once served has shrunk over the decades as Vietnam War-era veterans have retired. Among S&amp;amp;P 500 firms, only 13 are led by former service members, and just under 5% of their combined board members are veterans, according to S&amp;amp;P Global Market Intelligence data.</p> \n\n<p>Rather than barking orders and enforcing hierarchy, military leaders who succeed in the corporate world know how to coax different groups into collaborating, says retired Army Maj. Gen. Michael J. Diamond, an organizational leadership consultant.</p> \n\n<p>Before her retirement in 2013, Maj. Gen. Suzanne Vautrinot led the U.S. Air Force's cyber operations. She has parlayed that expertise into board seats at companies such as Wells Fargo and water treatment- and cleaning-products maker Ecolab Inc.</p> \n\n<p>Like many senior officers in the private sector, Gen. Vautrinot urges others not to call her by her Air Force title, instead going by \"Zan.\" Ecolab Chief Executive Doug Baker says her disarming style lets her push her points without ruffling feathers. \"Think about that generation of women generals,\" he says. \"You have to have pretty good [emotional intelligence] skills, and she does.\"</p> \n\n<p>Gen. Vautrinot says she examines company strategies much like military leaders are trained to do: \"You're looking at the future and connecting the dots, and you're looking at the risks,\" she said. \"If the assumptions that went into the strategy change, how do you think about adjusting?\" The approach \"isn't unique to me as a military member,\" she says, \"but it is inherent.\"</p> \n\n<p>Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling brought disparate brigades and regiments into a cohesive force as commander of the U.S. Army Europe. Similar challenges awaited when he joined Florida Hospital in 2013. Hired to develop idea-exchanges and other partnerships abroad, he soon after was asked to devise a leadership course for doctors, in part to improve collaboration with administrators and get physicians more involved in broader decisions at the 32,000-employee hospital group.</p> \n\n<p>Gen. Hertling's course culminates in several dozen doctors, nurses and administrators going to Gettysburg, Pa., each year. There, he assigns each to be a different figure in the pivotal Civil War battle; afterward the staff discuss how the lessons apply to health care. \"They really dig into that person's personality and see how their achievements or dysfunctions contributed to the bigger disaster or accomplishment,\" he says.</p> \n\n<p>Generals learn lessons, too. After retiring from the Army seven years ago, Lt. Gen. Stephen Speakes developed enterprise strategy at financial-services firm USAA for three years before he was let go. In hindsight, he says he failed to grasp the need to build consensus around his decisions and didn't recognize when colleagues weren't on board.</p> \n\n<p>\"In my old days, I was a decision-making machine. It was a quick look around the room and if no one had objections, it was go,\" he says. \"In the corporate world, once you make a decision, you have to continue to sell its execution.\"</p> \n\n<p>Now rounding his fourth year as CEO of Kalmar Rough Terrain Center LLC, a Texas unit of cargo-equipment maker Cargotec, Gen. Speakes says he has learned to encourage staff input and allow time for them to get behind ideas.</p> \n\n<p>He keeps up other practices honed during his 35-year military career, such as making sure he knows the situation on the ground, frequently holding company meetings on the plant floor. \"When manufacturing companies get too big, the leaders leave the manufacturing floor,\" he says. But \"the people on the line will tell you in a heartbeat what's going on and why.\"</p> \n\n<p>Write to Vanessa Fuhrmans at vanessa.fuhrmans@wsj.com</p> \n\n<p>(END) Dow Jones Newswires</p> \n\n<p>August 29, 2017 08:14 ET (12:14 GMT)</p>", "title": "Generals Bring Battlefield Expertise to the Business World", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/features/2017/08/29/generals-bring-battlefield-expertise-to-business-world.html", "published_at": "2017-08-29", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>It might seem counterintuitive, but sometimes, the best stocks to buy are the ones that are trading near their 52-week highs.

We asked that question to a team of Motley Fool investors, and they picked Rio Tinto plc (NYSE: RIO),&amp;#160;Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ: TTWO), and Mazor Robotics (NASDAQ: MZOR).</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/ReubenGBrewer/activity.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=3845d258-949d-11e7-b617-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Reuben Gregg Brewer Opens a New Window.</a> (Rio Tinto plc): Rio Tinto's shares have been on a tear since commodity prices started to move higher in early 2016. If you step in here, you have to keep in mind that commodity prices will have a huge impact on Rio's stock. That's particularly true for iron ore, which made up around 62% of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and 80% of underlying earnings through the first half of 2017.</p> \n\n<p>But here's the thing: Rio's business is really getting better. For example, it used the upturn in commodity prices to improve its <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/how-to-invest/how-to-value-stocks-how-to-read-a-balance-sheet-de.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=3845d258-949d-11e7-b617-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">balance sheet Opens a New Window.</a>, reducing long-term debt by nearly 14% in the first six months of the year, or roughly $2.3 billion dollars. But go back to the start of 2016, right before the commodity upturn, and Rio has cut long-term debt by nearly 30%, or around $6 billion.</p> \n\n<p>Long-term debt stands at a very reasonable 25% (or so) of the capital structure. Rio added debt to make it through the downturn, but is now prudently cutting debt as commodity markets recover.</p> \n\n<p>In addition, it's still expanding its business, even as it works to mend its balance sheet. It's got a few major projects in the works, with its Silvergrass iron-ore development expected to be fully commissioned later this year, the Amrun bauxite project set for 2019, and the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine on track for 2020. Like all miners, it cut back on capital spending during the downturn, but it clearly didn't stop spending on the projects it believed will position it best for the future. As those efforts bear fruit, the fundamentals of Rio's business will get stronger.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Commodity prices will always have a big impact on Rio's top and bottom lines. There's nothing it can do about that. But the improvement on the balance sheet and its strategic investments are things it can control -- and those efforts are paying off.</p> \n\n<p>Yes, the stock is hitting highs, but the underlying improvement in the business is real. Rio has not only proven on a fundamental level that it's a survivor, but also that it's a miner with plans to keep getting better in good times and bad. That remains true no matter what the price is today.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/keithnoonan/info.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=3845d258-949d-11e7-b617-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Keith Noonan Opens a New Window.</a>&amp;#160;(Take-Two Interactive):&amp;#160;Most known for its hugely successful&amp;#160;Grand Theft Auto&amp;#160;video game series, Take-Two Interactive has been on a huge winning streak. Shares are up roughly 850% over the last five years and have nearly doubled year to date.</p> \n\n<p>My thesis on whether Take-Two can continue to deliver stellar returns for shareholders can be simplified to three questions. Naturally, its performance will be affected by additional factors, but these are the drivers that best explain why I'm still bullish on the game publisher -- even at record prices.</p> \n\n<p>First, is Grand Theft Auto (GTA)&amp;#160;a property at the top of its popularity, or can it still expand its audience and sales? As the overall games industry has grown, GTA&amp;#160;has grown with it, with each mainline installment selling more than its immediate predecessor.</p> \n\n<p>GTA V&amp;#160;has shipped more than 80 million copies -- an incredible feat. I think the next installment has the potential to match or exceed the most recent release's profits if Take-Two takes the smart, and somewhat obvious, route after <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/07/08/take-two-interactives-grand-theft-auto-v-is-more-t.aspx?source=iaasitlnk0000003&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=3845d258-949d-11e7-b617-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">GTA V's performance Opens a New Window.</a>&amp;#160;-- and focuses on the sequel's online mode. It would need to release the game at the tail end of the current console cycle to take advantage of user-base size, and then release an updated version for the next generation of video game hardware.</p> \n\n<p>Next, does it look like the company's broader stable of properties is gaining strength? Again, the outlook is promising. With franchises like&amp;#160;NBA 2K,&amp;#160;Red Dead Redemption, and&amp;#160;Borderlands, a team of proven development studios, and the company's bigger push into mobile gaming, Take-Two has what it takes to benefit from industry momentum and capture the next level of growth with an expanding portfolio of franchises.</p> \n\n<p>Finally, will the company continue to benefit from growth of high-margin digital sales? With video games transitioning to digital distribution, players showing increasing appetites for in-game purchases, and a strong group of franchises to work with, Take-Two is on track to deliver wins here, as well.</p> \n\n<p>As the global games market continues to expand, Take-Two is positioned to be one of the biggest winners. I think long-term investors have the potential for substantial gains with the stock, even at today's record prices.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://my.fool.com/profile/TMFTypeoh/info.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=3845d258-949d-11e7-b617-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">Brian Feroldi Opens a New Window.</a> (Mazor Robotics):&amp;#160;I've been an investor&amp;#160;in the&amp;#160;robotic surgery upstart Mazor Robotics for <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/05/07/im-already-up-over-200-on-the-next-intuitive-surgi.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=3845d258-949d-11e7-b617-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">several years now</a>. While I knew that the company was highly speculative when I first purchased shares, I was attracted to Mazor's razor-and-blade business model. My willingness to invest so early has allowed me to triple my money in less than three years.</p> \n\n<p>Despite the huge gains, I still think that it makes sense for interested investors to pick up a few shares today. My reasoning is that the company recently released some big news related to its strategic alliance with Medtronic (NYSE: MDT). For those who haven't been following this story closely, Medtronic signed a <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/05/28/does-mazor-robotics-deal-with-medtronic-make-it-2.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;uuid=3845d258-949d-11e7-b617-0050569d4be0&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">transformative deal Opens a New Window.</a> with Mazor last year where it agreed to&amp;#160;co-market Mazor Robotics' systems. The deal also called for Medtronic to become a major investor in Mazor, and also granted it the right to deepen its investment in the company if the first phase of the partnership went well.</p> \n\n<p>Just a few days ago, we learned that Medtronic agreed to expand its relationship with Mazor earlier than expected. The new deal makes Medtronic into the exclusive provider of the Mazor X Surgical Assurance Platform and its accessories. In addition, Medtronic also agreed to invest another $40 million into Mazor and committed to annual minimums for Mazor X system purchases.</p> \n\n<p>Medtronic agreed to this move because phase one of the partnership led to 59 Mazor X system sales in less than nine months' time. That represents a significant acceleration when compared to what Mazor was able to sell on its own.</p> \n\n<p>When this news broke, Mazor's stock immediately jumped to a 52-week high, which makes sense because this deal promises to be a financial windfall for the company. With Mazor's growth trajectory now on firm footing, I'm much more confident that the company's future is looking bright. That's why I think it still makes sense to get in today, even though shares are trading quite close to their all time high.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than Take-Two Interactive SoftwareWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Many donors or their families contributed because of the players&#8217; repeated concussions and troubling symptoms before death.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;There are many questions that remain unanswered,&#8221; said lead author Dr. Ann McKee, a Boston University neuroscientist. &#8220;How common is this&#8221; in the general population and all football players?</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;How many years of football is too many?&#8221; and &#8220;What is the genetic risk? Some players do not have evidence of this disease despite long playing years,&#8221; she noted.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s also uncertain if some players&#8217; lifestyle habits &#8212; alcohol, drugs, steroids, diet &#8212; might somehow contribute, McKee said.</p> \n\n<p>Dr. Munro Cullum, a neuropsychologist at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, emphasized that the report is based on a selective sample of men who were not necessarily representative of all football players. He said problems other than CTE might explain some of their most common symptoms before death &#8212; depression, impulsivity and behavior changes. He was not involved in the report.</p> \n\n<p>McKee said research from the brain bank may lead to answers and an understanding of how to detect the disease in life, &#8220;while there&#8217;s still a chance to do something about it.&#8221; There&#8217;s no known treatment.</p> \n\n<p>The strongest scientific evidence says CTE can only be diagnosed by examining brains after death, although some researchers are experimenting with tests performed on the living. Many scientists believe that repeated blows to the head increase risks for developing CTE, leading to progressive loss of normal brain matter and an abnormal buildup of a protein called tau. Combat veterans and athletes in rough contact sports like football and boxing are among those thought to be most at risk.</p> \n\n<p>The new report was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p> \n\n<p>CTE was diagnosed in 177 former players or nearly 90 percent of brains studied. That includes 110 of 111 brains from former NFL players; 48 of 53 college players; nine of 14 semi-professional players, seven of eight Canadian Football league players and three of 14 high school players. The disease was not found in brains from two younger players.</p> \n\n<p>A panel of neuropathologists made the diagnosis by examining brain tissue, using recent criteria from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, McKee said.</p> \n\n<p>The NFL issued a statement saying these reports are important for advancing science related to head trauma and said the league &#8220;will continue to work with a wide range of experts to improve the health of current and former NFL athletes.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>After years of denials, the NFL acknowledged a link between head blows and brain disease and agreed in a $1 billion settlement to compensate former players who had accused the league of hiding the risks.</p> \n\n<p>The journal update includes many previously reported cases, including former NFL players Bubba Smith, Ken Stabler, Junior Seau and Dave Duerson.</p> \n\n<p>New ones include retired tight end Frank Wainright, whose 10-year NFL career included stints with the Miami Dolphins, New Orleans Saints and Baltimore Ravens. Wainright died last October at age 48 from a heart attack triggered by bleeding in the brain, said his wife, Stacie. She said he had struggled almost eight years with frightening symptoms including confusion, memory loss and behavior changes.</p> \n\n<p>Wainright played before the league adopted stricter safety rules and had many concussions, she said. He feared CTE and was adamant about donating his brain, she said.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;A lot of families are really tragically affected by it &#8212; not even mentioning what these men are going through and they&#8217;re really not sure what is happening to them. It&#8217;s like a storm that you can&#8217;t quite get out of,&#8221; his wife said.</p> \n\n<p>Frank Wycheck, another former NFL tight end, said he worries that concussions during his nine-year career &#8212; the last seven with the Tennessee Titans &#8212; have left him with CTE and he plans to donate his brain to research.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Some people have heads made of concrete, and it doesn&#8217;t really affect some of those guys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But CTE is real.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I know I&#8217;m suffering through it, and it&#8217;s been a struggle and I feel for all the guys out there that are going through this,&#8221; said Wycheck, 45.</p> \n\n<p>In the new report, McKee and colleagues found the most severe disease in former professional players; mild disease was found in all three former high school players diagnosed with the disease. Brain bank researchers previously reported that the earliest known evidence of CTE was found in a high school athlete who played football and other sports who died at age 18. He was not included in the current report.</p> \n\n<p>The average age of death among all players studied was 66.

A new biography traces his early quest for enlightenment and lifelong appreciation for Zen Buddhism. Everyone from ABC News to India Today has pondered the link between his religious interests and business acumen.</p> \n\n<p>All this for a guy who guarded his personal life like it was an Apple trade secret.</p> \n\n<p>On Oct. 30, the New York Times published the eulogy that Mona Simpson, Jobs&#8217;s sister, delivered at his Oct. 16 memorial service.</p> \n\n<p>In his last moments, Jobs&#8217; breath shortened, as if he were climbing a steep path. His last words were &#8220;OH WOW. OH WOW. OH WOW,&#8221; Simpson writes.</p> \n\n<p>Whatever Jobs saw, he had been seeking it for decades, according to a new biography by Walter Isaacson.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;For most of my life, I&#8217;ve felt there must be more to our existence than meets the eye,&#8221; Jobs told Isaacson. The adopted son of blue-collar Californians spent much of his early adulthood searching for that unseen something.</p> \n\n<p>At age 13, Jobs asked the Lutheran pastor of his parents&#8217; church if God knew about starving children. &#8220;Yes, God knows everything,&#8221; the pastor replied. Jobs never returned to church, refusing to worship a God who allowed such suffering.</p> \n\n<p>Like many baby boomers, Jobs later turned to Eastern spirituality, particularly countercultural keystones such as Be Here Now, Baba Ram Dass' guide to meditation and psychedelic drugs.</p> \n\n<p>He also studied Buddhism, practicing meditation and reading Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind, a collection of lectures by Shunryu Suzuki, one of the first Zen masters to teach in America.</p> \n\n<p>In 1974, Jobs traveled halfway around the world, to India, in search of his own guru. Upon returning, he found one in his hometown of Los Altos, Calif., where a Suzuki disciple, Kobun Chino Otagawa, had opened the Haiku Zen Center.</p> \n\n<p>Jobs and the Zen master quickly forged a bond, discussing life and Buddhism during midnight walks.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I ended up spending as much time with him as I could,&#8221; Jobs told Isaacson. &#8220;Zen has been a deep influence in my life ever since.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Jobs even considered traveling to Eihei-ji, the main training temple of the Soto school of Zen in Japan. But Kobun, as he was known, counseled Jobs to stay in California.</p> \n\n<p>Les Kaye, a Zen teacher in Silicon Valley who also studied under Kobun, remembers Kobun as enigmatic and wise. &#8220;He was the epitome of an enlightened being: sweet, kind and generous. People flocked to him.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In 1976, after just one year, Jobs stopped practicing Buddhism at the Haiku Zen Center, said Kaye, who was a member of the center at the time. Apple had begun to consume the budding businessman&#8217;s attention.</p> \n\n<p>Jobs kept in contact with Kobun, asking him to officiate at his 1991 wedding. He also gave friends recordings of Kobun&#8217;s lectures, including one in which he cautions against craving. Buddhism&#8217;s &#8220;first noble truth&#8221; teaches that desire fuels suffering.</p> \n\n<p>Jobs bristled when a friend pointed out the irony of a marketing genius warning against materialism, according to Isaacson.</p> \n\n<p>When Kobun drowned in 2002, Jobs called Kaye in tears. &#8220;Kobun's death really struck him,&#8221; Kaye said. &#8220;He was beside himself.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Jobs believed that Zen meditation taught him to concentrate and ignore distractions, according to Isaacson. He also learned to trust intuition and curiosity &#8212; what Buddhists call &#8220;beginner's mind&#8221; &#8212; over analysis and preconceptions.</p> \n\n<p>More visibly, Apple&#8217;s sleek, minimalist designs reveal Jobs&#8217;s zeal for Zen aesthetics &#8212; the uncluttered lines of calligraphy and Japanese gardens, according to Isaacson&#8217;s book.</p> \n\n<p>Kaye, who teaches meditation to Silicon Valley companies, said Jobs was delighted when he began offering classes at Apple 12 years ago. He particularly wanted Apple&#8217;s engineers to learn meditation, Kaye said, to boost their creativity.</p> \n\n<p>But Jobs told Kaye that he had practiced Zen &#8220;only occasionally&#8221; in recent years.</p> \n\n<p>Despite his Buddhist background, Jobs was often mean, manipulative and egocentric, writes Isaacson, whose book is filled with tales of the Apple chief&#8217;s abusive behavior.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately his Zen training never quite produced in him a Zen-like calm of inner serenity,&#8221; Isaacson writes, &#8220;and that, too, is part of his legacy.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Kaye, the head teacher of Kannon Do Zen Meditation Center in Mountain View, Calif., said Jobs didn&#8217;t practice Buddhism long enough to let it sink in.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;He got to the aesthetic part of Zen &#8212; the relationship between lines and spaces, the quality and craftsmanship,&#8221; Kaye said. &#8220;But he didn&#8217;t stay long enough to get the Buddhist part, the compassion part, the sensitivity part.&#8221;</p>", "title": "Since his death, Steve Jobs\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 private spirituality now an open book", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://baptistnews.com/article/sincehisdeathstevejobsprivatespiritualitynowanopenbook/", "published_at": "", "bias": 3}, {"text": "<p>QUEENS (NY)Queens Chronicleby Bryan Joiner, South Queens Editor&amp;#160;Father John Thompson, the former pastor at St. Elizabeth&#8217;s parish in Ozone Park who is on trial for allegedly embezzling thousands of dollars to finance a live-in gay lover at the church, may have done the same thing with a male go-go dancer at a Brooklyn church in the 1980s, according to trial testimony.

Over the past six-plus decades, Buffett has grown his personal wealth from just shy of $10,000 to $68 billion. Although Buffett may not be correct on every investment he's made throughout the years, his overwhelming growth in net worth, coupled with his willingness to share what the stock market has taught him over multiple decades, has transformed him into the face of long-term investing.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Best of all, Buffett makes his thoughts readily available via an annual shareholder letter, as well as through Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting, which typically draws around 40,000 shareholders and is set up as a multi-day event. Buffett also isn't shy about doing interviews with a host of financial news agencies. In other words, we don't have to look far to find the next great nugget of wisdom from Buffett.</p> \n\n<p>Warren Buffett's best nugget of wisdom is somewhat strange Previously, I've listed some of my <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2012/02/22/the-25-smartest-things-warren-buffett-ever-said-.aspx?source=eptfxblnk0000004\" type=\"external\">favorite Buffett quotes Opens a New Window.</a>, as well as some of the reasoning behind why they're so meaningful. However, with Buffett regularly talking to the media and his shareholders, <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/03/07/13-brand-new-warren-buffett-quotes-youve-got-to-se.aspx?source=eptfxblnk0000004\" type=\"external\">new nuggets of wisdom Opens a New Window.</a> emerge quite frequently. But if my arm were twisted and I needed to choose one particular Buffett quote that stands out, this might be it:</p> \n\n<p>In other words, Warren Buffett loves it when stocks he owns or is buying fall, which is somewhat strange since it's the complete opposite of what we're taught when becoming investors. When we buy something, the last thing we want to see is any sort of red ink in the profit/loss column. But that's not how Buffett thinks. A solid company that's entered a period of temporary problems represents the perfect opportunity for a long-term investor like Buffett to add to his position. Best of all, since it's unlikely we're going to invest a huge amount of money at any one time, a falling stock allows us to wade into our position, which can improve our cost basis.</p> \n\n<p>A perfect example of this thesis in action has been Buffet's incremental purchases of technology giant IBM . Even though Buffett has been quite frank that his bullishness could be misplaced, he's not been shy about adding to IBM since his first purchase during Q1 2011. He views IBM's languishing stock price as an opportunity, and he's counting on Big Blue making a slow but steady transition into the cloud. Based on Berkshire's 13-F filed in mid-February, his company owned just over 81 million shares of IBM, equal to $11.9 billion, or 8.3% of all outstanding shares.</p> \n\n<p>Stocks that'll have you investing like BuffettHowever, we don't have to stick within the confines of Buffett's portfolio to find solid businesses that have fallen on perceived-to-be temporary hard times and look ripe for the picking by long-term investors.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Take biotech giant Gilead Sciences as a good example -- a company Buffett himself would be unlikely to buy, since biotech companies require constant observation because of clinical trial data.</p> \n\n<p>Two weeks ago Gilead Sciences reported first-quarter results that had investors running for the exit. Despite delivering modest sales and EPS growth, sales of its blockbuster hepatitis C virus (HCV) drug Harvoni fell 14% from the prior-year quarter to $3.01 billion. With Harvoni viewed as Gilead's main recent growth driver, investors knocked Gilead's share price down by double-digits on the news.</p> \n\n<p>But this is more than likely an instance of temporary problems rather than something for long-term investors to worry about. Pricing pressures on Harvoni were to be expected as new once-daily HCV entrants hit the market, and Gilead responded by offering bigger gross-to-net discounts during the first quarter. Despite these challenges, Gilead didn't lose HCV market share, and its primary rival in convenience, Zepatier, a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration in late January, sold just $50 million.</p> \n\n<p>Looking ahead, Gilead could have a pan-genotypic HCV therapy approved before the end of June, which could reignite its already dominant HCV sales, and it recently had the FDA approve its next-generation oral HIV medication Genvoya. Genvoya contains a new formulation of tenofovir that's designed to increase its concentration in infected cells while reducing its concentration throughout the remainder of the bloodstream. This has few, if any, markings of a broken stock.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Flickr user Karlis Dambrans.</p> \n\n<p>The same could be said of technology giant Apple , another stock Buffett probably wouldn't buy since he generally has an aversion to tech stocks.</p> \n\n<p>Apple reported its second-quarter results a few days prior to Gilead, and the reaction was pretty similar (save for the fact that Apple's valuation tumbled by more than the worth of 477 of 500 S&amp;amp;P 500 companies). Apple announced Q2 sales of $50.6 billion, a 13% decline from the prior-year quarter and its first year-over-year sales decline in 13 years; it delivered $1.90 in EPS, missing Wall Street's estimates by a mile; and it reported its first iPhone sales decline ever! You can certainly see why skittish investors ran for cover.</p> \n\n<p>Yet for long-term investors, Apple's decline could represent the perfect opportunity to wade into the water and build, or add to, a position. Apple still has the world's most valuable brand according to Interbrand in 2015, and it undoubtedly has some of the most loyal customers of any company. When it introduces new products and services, and expands its Apple brand platform, chances are very good that its loyal customers will be buyers. Whether it be the iPhone, the recently launched Apple Music, or the highly anticipated iCar by the end of the decade, Apple has products to inspire growth.</p> \n\n<p>Long-term investors can also take solace in the fact that Apple has substantial cash flow. Apple ended Q2 with roughly $230 billion in cash, and it's capable of tacking on $40 billion-plus in cash every year, including its generous share repurchase and dividend return. Thus, by the end of the decade Apple could be sporting in excess of $400 billion in cash! Again, this is hardly what I'd call a broken stock.</p> \n\n<p>These are just two examples of downtrodden stocks that could have you investing like Buffett.

He will be OK, but he&#8217;s missing out on the tour. He plans to join us in a couple weeks, and we will be a whole band again.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Having a pinch-hitter drummer has also made the set lists a little more simple.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>With 11 albums under their belt, the Old 97&#8217;s enjoy going deep into their catalog for shows.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re working it out,&#8221; Miller says. &#8220;We found a drummer to fill in, and he&#8217;s been learning a new song each day from our older stuff. This gives us some flexibility.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The Old 97&#8217;s have been making music for more than 20 years.</p> \n\n<p>The band broke through with its 1997 album, &#8220;Too Far to Care,&#8221; its major-label debut.</p> \n\n<p>In recording the album, the band strayed away from Los Angeles and New York and recorded at Sonic Ranch Studios in Tornillo, Texas, just outside El Paso.</p> \n\n<p>And so when it came time for the band &#8211; which still consists of the same four members: Miller, guitarist Ken Bethea, bassist Murry Hammond, and Peeples &#8211; to record their newest endeavor, producer Vance Powell brought up the idea of returning to Tornillo.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We knew instantly that it was the perfect move,&#8221; Miller says. &#8220;We weren&#8217;t trying to remake &#8216;Too Far to Care,&#8217; but to make something where fans would say, &#8216;This band hasn&#8217;t lost a step in 20-some years.&#8217; It&#8217;s been one of the best decisions that we&#8217;ve made.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Returning to Tornillo was more than just a gimmick and proved key to the album&#8217;s direction.</p> \n\n<p>The studio has been expanded and updated, but the band members went back into the same recording space. They even stayed in the same bedrooms &#8211; Miller opened the drawer of his nightstand and found a note that he had written 20 years earlier.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The time-travel element can&#8217;t be overstated,&#8221; the singer says. &#8220;It was a beautiful feeling of completing a circle &#8211; we&#8217;re the same people, but we had grown so much as bandmates and friends. It really made me believe in the power of experience and that you do get better with time. We&#8217;re capable of so much more now than we were two decades prior, but it also felt like we just took a coffee break in 1996 and now here we were, sitting back down to make a new record.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p />", "title": "Roots renewal: Old 97\u2019s returns to studio", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/978809/roots-renewal.html", "published_at": "", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>Obama&#8217;s Regret</p> \n\n<p>: What does President Obama believe is his biggest failure during his first term in the Oval Office?

At this point, there&#8217;s very little Mitt Romney can do to win the election other than hope for a big slip-up from President Obama. Regardless, Romney appears to be shifting tactics again just days after his campaign announced its candidate would alter his strategy. The new message emerging from the campaign: Romney will change Washington, D.C., from the inside. That&#8217;s the exact opposite position of what he took when he campaigned against John McCain in 2007.

However, Brown &#8212; who is locked in a tough battle with Warren to retain his Senate seat &#8212; did offer praise for Hillary Clinton. &#8220;I think Secretary Clinton is doing a great job,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve told her that and I think she&#8217;s really a bright star in that administration.

Republicans are continuing their efforts to redefine rape and effectively limit in scope what constitutes sexual assault. In New Mexico, for example, Gov. Susana Martinez supports legislation that would require women to prove they were &#8220;forcibly raped&#8221; in order to obtain financial assistance for children that were conceived because of rape.

Where has it been hardest to make progress? Wages, housing, schools?&#8221; Chris Smith asked.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s been hardest is the way our legal system is structured to favor private property,&#8221; de Blasio said. &#8220;I think people all over this city, of every background, would like to have the city government be able to determine which building goes where, how high it will be, who gets to live in it, what the rent will be.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Wait a second &#8212; de Blasio thinks residents of New York want the city to decide who gets to live in what buildings? &amp;#160;No wonder we like to refer to him as &#8220;Comrade&#8221; de Blasio. &amp;#160;But there&#8217;s more.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a socialistic impulse, which I hear every day, in every kind of community, that they would like things to be planned in accordance to their needs,&#8221; he added, apparently drawing from the Communist maxim of &#8220;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He then admitted his desire for central planning: &#8220;And I would, too. Unfortunately, what stands in the way of that is hundreds of years of history that have elevated property rights and wealth to the point that that&#8217;s the reality that calls the tune on a lot of development.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He added:</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;ll give you an example. I was down one day on Varick Street, somewhere close to Canal, and there was a big sign out front of a new condo saying, &#8220;Units start at $2 million.&#8221; And that just drives people stark raving mad in this city, because that kind of development is clearly not for everyday people. It&#8217;s almost like it&#8217;s being flaunted. Look, if I had my druthers, the city government would determine every single plot of land, how development would proceed. And there would be very stringent requirements around income levels and rents. That&#8217;s a world I&#8217;d love to see, and I think what we have, in this city at least, are people who would love to have the New Deal back, on one level. They&#8217;d love to have a very, very powerful government, including a federal government, involved in directly addressing their day-to-day reality.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s not reachable right now. And it leaves this friction, and this anger, which is visceral. I try to explain the things we can do. It&#8217;s a little bit of a Serenity Prayer &#8212; let&#8217;s talk about the things we can fix. The rent freeze we did reached over 2 million people.In 2015 and 2016, the mayor&#8217;s appointees ruled that new one-year leases on rent-stabilized units could not increase. I&#8217;ve talked to people who were going to be evicted, and we stopped the eviction by giving them a free lawyer. And I&#8217;ve talked to people who got affordable housing under our plan for 200,000 apartments.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"https://americarisingpac.org/in-interview-bill-de-blasio-comes-out-against-private-property-andrew-cuomo/\" type=\"external\">America Rising PAC</a> said de Blasio &#8220;channeled Vladimir Lenin and Fidel Castro in his comments about private property.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Mayor de Blasio has long been anti-capitalism,&#8221; America Rising added. &#8220;With his latest incendiary comments to New York Magazine, it&#8217;s clear he&#8217;s <a href=\"http://pagesix.com/2017/08/13/mayor-bill-de-blasio-may-be-running-for-president/\" type=\"external\">serious</a> about challenging Bernie Sanders in 2020 for the title of most out-of-touch leftist running for president.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;This is today&#8217;s Democrat Party,&#8221; Jim Hoft said at the <a href=\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/09/bill-de-blasio-goes-full-commie-argues-private-property-rights/\" type=\"external\">Gateway Pundit</a>. &#8220;Open Communism.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Sadly, a growing number of people actually <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">support this nonsense</a>, despite the fact that socialism has never worked and Communism has killed some 100 million people.</p> \n\n<p>Maybe de Blasio should go live in Venezuela for a few years&#8230; Maybe he&#8217;ll have a change of heart. &amp;#160;Or not&#8230;</p> \n\n<p>H/T <a href=\"http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/09/bill-de-blasio-goes-full-commie-argues-private-property-rights/\" type=\"external\">Gateway Pundit</a></p> \n\n<p>Related:</p> \n\n<p>If you haven&#8217;t checked out and liked our&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeFiringLine?fref=ts\" type=\"external\">Facebook</a>&amp;#160;page, please go&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ConservativeFiringLine?fref=ts\" type=\"external\">here</a>&amp;#160;and do so.</p> \n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re as concerned about online censorship as we are, go&amp;#160; <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Banned-Facebook-Enables-Militant-Islamic/dp/1944212221/\" type=\"external\">here</a>&amp;#160;and order this book (Remember, half of what we earn will be <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">donated to Hurricane Harvey relief</a>):</p>", "title": "Bill de Blasio goes full Communist, argues against private property, says state should determine who lives where", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://conservativefiringline.com/bill-de-blasio-goes-full-communist-argues-private-property-says-state-determine-lives/", "published_at": "2017-09-06", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>LOS ANGELES (AP) &#8212; Universal Music Group's pre-Grammy brunch featured performances by its top-selling stars, Sam Smith and Iggy Azalea, and a sneak peak at the upcoming Amy Winehouse documentary.</p> \n\n<p>The record company on Saturday debuted a close-to-complete trailer of \"Amy,\" which is due in theaters later this year.

As part of the hiring process, he openly negotiated a &#8220;spousal accommodation&#8221; giving his wife a preferential spot in the university&#8217;s hiring process so long as she was deemed qualified for the position in question.</p> \n\n<p>After Clement came on board in July, he elevated a vacant collections librarian position to director of collections. Steven Harris, who left UNM two years ago, did the work previously but did not receive a stipend for the responsibility. However, according to Clement, the new position will carry a $10,000 stipend on top of the salary.</p> \n\n<p>Clement&#8217;s wife, Suzanne, will be the first and only candidate for the new job to be considered in round one. She would be hired if a search committee considers her qualified and if the library staff vote to support her, absent competition from any other candidates for the post.</p> \n\n<p>Rick Clement came to UNM from Utah State University, where he was dean of libraries and adjunct professor of history. His wife was a tenured associate professor and head of cataloging there. Clement says there&#8217;s no conflict because his wife would not answer directly to him &#8211; although anyone else hired for this position presumably would &#8211; and he would not participate in the hiring process. Clement acknowledged he would have prefered it if his wife had been able to find another job.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Though Clement is seeking only what UNM promised him when he was hired, UNM&#8217;s filling this job without competition smacks of favoritism.</p> \n\n<p>While offering jobs to spouses is not uncommon in academia, perhaps it&#8217;s time for the entrenched university culture to take another look at this practice.

The company closed a financing round of $1.2 billion on Thursday with investors putting their value at around $40 billion, according to a <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/uber-files-to-sell-1-8-billion-in-new-shares/\" type=\"external\">New York Times</a>&amp;#160;report.</p> \n\n<p>Uber will add that cash to the $1.5 million they previously raised, and even more money may head Uber&#8217;s way. They could potentially sell another $600 million in stock. In addition, Uber, in conjunction with Goldman Sachs, is working to possibly sell another $1 billion in debt to private well-off clients of the Wall Street firm. According to <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2014/12/04/uber-files-to-sell-1-8-billion-of-new-stock/\" type=\"external\">Forbes</a>, this could bring the final figure close to $1.8 billion.</p> \n\n<p>Travis Kalanick, Uber CEO, says that the money will be put toward an expansion of San Francisco-based Uber in Asia and for &#8220;strategic investments,&#8221; according to <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/12/04/uber-funding/19890677/\" type=\"external\">USA Today</a>. Kalanick also mentioned the rapid progress the company has made.&amp;#160; He claimed that more than a million jobs will become available across the globe by next year.</p> \n\n<p>Uber&#8217;s rise is one of the most accelerated in recent years, according to NY Times. Uber was simply an app that enabled consumers to get a personal driver at the push of a smartphone button just five years ago. In those five years, Uber has grown so much that it has passed members of Silicon Valley&#8217;s exclusive 11-digit club (start-ups who are valued at more than $10 billion).</p> \n\n<p>Although the additional money is paving the way for Uber&#8217;s success in the future,&amp;#160; major criticism has surfaced with it. Customers and lawmakers expressed their concerns about privacy following a report that revealed that an Uber executive tracked a journalist&#8217;s ride without permission, according to USA Today.</p> \n\n<p>A tool named &#8220;God View&#8221; that allows Uber executives to track driver and rider data prompted Uber to update their privacy policies and create stricter rules. Kalanick stated that in the coming months, Uber will be a more humble company that will &#8220;set new standards in data privacy,&#8221; according to Forbes.&amp;#160;The criticism has not lessened investors&#8217; enthusiasm about Uber.</p> \n\n<p>Uber is planning on raising more money in an effort to become the best service for transporting people quickly and painlessly. Kalanick plans for Uber to eventually reach a point where it is not only a transportation system, but it is a delivery system for everything and anything (even groceries). To reach that goal, serious amounts of capital will be needed.</p> \n\n<p>Uber has made the largest footprint in the ride-sharing start-up industry. It has broadened its services to more than 250 cities in 50 countries in the past year. Uber posted on their blog that the company is six times as large as it was last year and it continues to grow and expand, reported NY Times.</p> \n\n<p>Although Uber has had rapid success, it does face some tough competition. Lyft is a ride-service that offers similar services and is also backed by big investors. Lyft recently appointed new head executives in an effort to drive customers and drivers away from Uber. Uber is also facing Hailo, which has a similar app for calling taxis, that is seen throughout Europe. In Southeast Asia, a company called GrabTaxi is already booming with more than 60,000 drivers.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Uber adds $1.2 billion in latest financing round", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "http://natmonitor.com/2014/12/05/uber-adds-1-2-billion-in-latest-financing-round/", "published_at": "2014-12-05", "bias": 3}, {"text": "<p>The number of cases and arrests related to child pornography is rising steadily in India, <a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Child-pornography-rising-in-India/articleshow/9799477.cms\" type=\"external\">reports the Times of India</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Across the country, there were 99 cases of child pornography in 2007, 105 in 2008 and 139 in 2009, the paper cited&amp;#160;minister of state for home M Ramachandran as saying in an address to parliament.</p> \n\n<p>Over the same period, there were 86 arrests in 2007, 90 in 2008 and 141 in 2009, Ramachandran said.</p> \n\n<p>The states of Kerala and Maharashtra accounted for most of the cases, with 27, 17 and 25 child pornography cases in Maharashtra for the tree years in question and 20, 39 and 44 cases in Kerala.</p>", "title": "Child pornography arrests increasing in India", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://pri.org/stories/2011-08-31/child-pornography-arrests-increasing-india", "published_at": "2011-08-31", "bias": 3}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Procter &amp;amp; Gamble, maker of Ariel detergent and Gillette razors, reported an 8.3 percent fall in third-quarter profit, citing a slowdown in market growth, geopolitical uncertainty and a stronger dollar.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Net income attributable to the Cincinnati, Ohio-based company declined to $2.52 billion, or 93 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31, from $2.75 billion, or 97 cents per share, a year earlier.</p> \n\n<p>P&amp;amp;G, whose iconic brands include Tide, Pampers, Head-and-Shoulders and Vicks, said net sales fell about 1 percent to $15.61 billion - the thirteenth straight quarter of declines.</p> \n\n<p>(Reporting by Richa Naidu in Bengaluru; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh)</p>", "title": "P&G's 3Q Profit Declines 8.3%", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/markets/2017/04/26/procter-gamble-reports-mixed-3q-results.html", "published_at": "2017-04-26", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>LINCOLN, Neb.

(NYSE:RGR) expects gun sales to continue to flourish during President Donald Trump&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s tenure in the White House, pushing back against the notion that a pro-gun administration would dampen consumer demand.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>During a conference call Thursday, one Wall Street analyst suggested that Trump would have a negative impact on the consumer firearms market, citing record-breaking sales during eight years of the Obama administration. In recent years, sales spiked when consumers sensed an elevated threat of new gun-control measures. Trump has been a vocal advocate for the gun industry, and his choice of Neil Gorsuch to join the Supreme Court calmed fears that existing gun rights could be curbed.</p> \n\n<p>Ruger CEO Michael Fifer said other factors, such as owners buying multiple firearms, will keep the industry going strong.</p> \n\n<p>&#226;&#8364;&#339;I think that&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s kind of a pretty harsh one to say that the levels will revert back to 2008,&#226;&#8364;&#157; Fifer told analysts on Ruger&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s fourth-quarter earnings call. &#226;&#8364;&#339;Firearms ownership is much more socially acceptable. It&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s much wider than it was before. There are more states that have adopted laws enabling concealed carry.&#226;&#8364;&#157;</p> \n\n<p>Fifer also said media criticism of police officers is causing crime rates to spike in some cities, thus driving Americans to purchase guns because &#226;&#8364;&#339;they want to defend themselves.&#226;&#8364;&#157; He added that firearms are more widely available, and gun makers such as Ruger are offering &#226;&#8364;&#339;exciting new products.&#226;&#8364;&#157;</p> \n\n<p>&#226;&#8364;&#339;There are more reasons to have guns now than ever before. And so, I&#226;&#8364;&#8482;m not going to read too much into the current situation,&#226;&#8364;&#157; Fifer said.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Ruger&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s fourth-quarter sales rose 6.2% to $161.8 million. Earnings climbed 22% to $20.8 million.</p> \n\n<p>For the full year, Ruger booked a 21% increase in sales.</p> \n\n<p>Investors, however, are bracing for a slowdown in gun sales. While the broader market has rallied, shares of Ruger and its competitors have declined since Trump&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s victory in November. Ruger is down 22% since the election, while American Outdoor Brands (NASDAQ:AOBC), the renamed parent company of Smith &amp;amp; Wesson, is down 32%.</p> \n\n<p>Cabela&#226;&#8364;&#8482;s (NYSE:CAB), the hunting and outdoor megastore,&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">saw gun sales taper off at the end of 2016</a>.</p>", "title": "Ruger CEO: Gun Sales Can Thrive Under Trump", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/markets/2017/02/23/ruger-ceo-gun-sales-can-thrive-under-trump.html", "published_at": "2017-02-23", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........</p> \n\n<p>LONDON &#8212; Northern Ireland is no longer riven by sectarian violence, but its deeply divided politics have thrown Britain&#8217;s Brexit plans into disarray.</p> \n\n<p>Prime Minister Theresa May&#8217;s government was holding talks Tuesday with its Northern Irish political ally in a bid to salvage an agreement with the European Union ahead of a deadline next week.</p> \n\n<p>Britain and the EU came close Monday to agreeing on key divorce terms, including how to maintain an open Irish border after the U.K. &#8212; including Northern Ireland &#8212; leaves the EU. But the agreement was scuttled at the last minute when the Democratic Unionist Party &#8212; which props up May&#8217;s minority government &#8212; warned it would not support a deal it saw as undermining Northern Ireland&#8217;s place in the United Kingdom.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>The party&#8217;s leader in Parliament, Nigel Dodds, said the proposed deal was &#8220;clearly unacceptable in its current form.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>May characterized the problem as a minor hiccup, saying neogotiations with the EU had made progress but &#8220;there are still a couple of issues we need to work on.&#8221; She said talks would reconvene by the end of the week.</p> \n\n<p>Britain and the EU have only days to make a deal before a Dec. 14-15 EU summit that will decide whether Brexit talks can move on to future relations and trade. The lack of progress so far has raised concerns that Britain may not have a deal by the time it officially leaves on March 29, 2019.</p> \n\n<p>EU Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said the bloc would restart talks as soon as Britain was ready.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The show is now in London,&#8221; he said.</p> \n\n<p>The crisis is a sharp reminder of the fraught and delicate politics of Northern Ireland, which has left behind decades of Catholic-Protestant violence but not the conflicting allegiances and identities that drove the &#8220;Troubles.&#8221; Almost 3,700 people were killed in nearly four decades of violence.</p> \n\n<p>After Britain leaves the bloc, the currently invisible 310-mile (500-kilometer) frontier between Northern Ireland and Ireland will be the U.K.&#8217;s only land border with the EU. A generation ago, the border was marked by military watchtowers and checkpoints, and many crossings were blocked to stop the movement of militants and smuggled goods.</p> \n\n<p>Customs controls were abolished when the EU single market was established in 1993, and security checks began to disappear after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement peace accord. Today the border has no customs posts or other infrastructure, and thousands of people live on one side and work, shop or go to school on the other.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The last 20 years have nearly erased it out of our mentality,&#8221; said John Sheridan, whose Northern Ireland farm abuts the border with the south.</p> \n\n<p>Like many, Sheridan worries that any hardening of the border could undermine that progress and renew old tensions between pro-British Unionists and Irish nationalists. Sheridan also sends his cattle and sheep cross the border, and says tariffs would devastate his business.</p> \n\n<p>Britain says it wants to maintain a &#8220;frictionless&#8221; flow of people and goods with no border posts after Brexit. But Ireland and the other EU nations are demanding to know how that will work if Britain is outside the EU&#8217;s borderless single market and its tariff-free customs union, a looser trading bloc that includes non-EU states like Turkey.</p> \n\n<p>Negotiators were discussing an agreement that would commit Britain to maintaining &#8220;regulatory alignment&#8221; between Northern Ireland and Ireland after Brexit in order to keep the border transparent for trade, without customs posts or other obstacles.</p> \n\n<p>That language alarmed the DUP, a Protestant Unionist party that opposes any special deal to keep Northern Ireland&#8217;s economy closely aligned with the Republic of Ireland.</p> \n\n<p>The DUP&#8217;s Dodds said Dublin politicians &#8220;are flexing their muscles &#8230; in a reckless and dangerous way that is putting at risk years of good Anglo-Irish relations.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The DUP has only 10 seats in Britain&#8217;s Parliament but May relies on its support to stay in power. If she ignores the party&#8217;s wishes her government could fall, triggering a new election with the opposition Labour Party ahead in the polls.</p> \n\n<p>The party&#8217;s intransigence has been seized on by British supporters of &#8220;soft Brexit,&#8221; who want to maintain a close relationship with the EU. Some suggested that if Northern Ireland was given special status, Scotland, Wales or even London could seek the same. They suggested that the solution was to keep all of the U.K. inside the single market and customs union.</p> \n\n<p>The government has ruled that out, but Labour Party Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer said it should reconsider.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;If the price of the prime minister&#8217;s approach is the break-up of the Union and reopening of bitter divides in Northern Ireland, then the price is too high,&#8221; Starmer said.</p> \n\n<p>Starmer said the Conservative government&#8217;s fantasies about Brexit had collided with &#8220;brutal reality.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Yesterday the rubber hit the road,&#8221; he said, adding: &#8220;The DUP tail is wagging the Tory dog.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report.</p>", "title": "UK scrambles to salvage Brexit deal after Irish border hitch", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/1102144/uk-scrambles-to-salvage-brexit-deal-after-irish-border-hitch.html", "published_at": "2017-12-05", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>Hawa Allan&#8217;s verses breathe life and empathy into <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/haiti/article103920086.html\" type=\"external\">headlines</a> about the travails Haitian migrants face as they cross from Brazil to Mexico, and onward to the United States.

The left-leaning Workers Party, PT (as it is known by its Portuguese acronym), is facing an existential crisis after 14 years in power. Accusations of corruption from opposition parties and the glare of a right-wing media empire could hand the reins of government to conservative forces. Mass street protests drawing tens of thousands of mostly white, upper-middle-class families with slick props and coordinated, simplistic messaging offer a convincing backdrop of popular political will for change. It is a familiar script in Latin America&#8212;one that has played out in Venezuela, Ecuador, Honduras and elsewhere. Will Brazil succumb to this new model of right-wing coups?</p> \n\n<p>The PT swept into power on the wings of the once-beloved President Luiz In&#225;cio Lula da Silva. Lula&#8212;as he is still affectionately known&#8212;was succeeded by his onetime chief of staff, Dilma Rousseff. Both Lula and President Rousseff now face serious accusations stemming from their former affiliation with the Brazilian energy company Petrobras. Rousseff faces impeachment proceedings that have been brought against her by opposition officials with support from the judiciary.</p> \n\n<p>Rousseff <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35877230\" type=\"external\">has remained defiant</a>, saying, &#8220;I have committed no irregularity. I will never resign.&#8221; And thus far there has been no proof of wrongdoing on her part. Still, the calls for her resignation are relentless. There have also been no charges against Lula, despite a swirl of rumors and three hours of questioning during his recent detention by police that some characterized as a kidnapping. Lula has stated he will run for president again in 2018, which may be part of what the right fears.</p> \n\n<p>Meleiza Figueroa, an American doctoral student at the University of California at Berkeley and an occasional Truthdig contributor, is currently living in Brazil and conducting research in the Amazon. <a href=\"http://www.risingupwithsonali.com/brazils-ruling-party-in-disarray-after-attempt-to-shield-lula/\" type=\"external\">In a Skype interview</a> from the municipality of Santar&#233;m in the state of Par&#225;, she described what is unfolding in Brazil as &#8220;a naked power grab on the part of the right-wing elites.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>But among conservative or even mainstream media, one word is bandied about as a catchall to indict PT officials: corruption. For example, one author characterizes <a href=\"http://mironline.ca/?p=9872\" type=\"external\">the ubiquitous protest sign &#8220;Fora Dilma&#8221;</a> (which translates to &#8220;Out Dilma&#8221;) as &#8220;A People&#8217;s Quest to End Corruption.&#8221; But, as Figueroa noted, Brazil&#8217;s political system is based on low levels of corruption through local patronage systems that have existed for centuries, not just since the PT assumed power. The PT&#8217;s mistake was to not &#8220;overturn the old order &#8230; instead they tried to work within the existing system and allied themselves with some of the people that engaged in this type of political culture,&#8221; she explained. On the flip side, &#8220;The PT, more than any other government, has prosecuted officials for corruption.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The Brazilian federal police have named their investigation into the allegations of government corruption &#8220; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35725415\" type=\"external\">Operation Car Wash</a>.&#8221; But according to Figueroa, critics point out that &#8220;the people who are investigating Operation Car Wash are the people who are even more dirty.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Manufactured political crises often require the prominent role of media in whipping up public indignation and frenzy. To that end, aiding Brazil&#8217;s right-wing opposition parties is the popular television network Globo, which has been airing wall-to-wall coverage of the mass anti-government mobilizations across the country. Speaking to teleSUR, media critic Sylvia Moretzsohn explained that Globo acts to &#8220;create the conditions for a coup. They want make it so the public is in favor of the ouster of Dilma, but always in the name of a noble cause: the fight against corruption.&#8221; Globo recently leaked intercepted calls between Lula and Rousseff discussing responses to their detractors&#8212;which generated a predictable level of public outrage.</p> \n\n<p>Globo is covering the anti-PT mobilizations in a way it has never done for left-wing actions, said Figueroa. Footage of the protests shows largely white, well-dressed crowds, similar to the opposition seen in Venezuela. Figueroa cited an <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35824122\" type=\"external\">image that went viral</a> because of the racial politics it represents: &#8220;a white couple going to a protest with their dog, and their black maid following them with a stroller carrying their two daughters.&#8221; The BBC wrote that the photo &#8220;became a symbol of how polarized Brazil is over the current protests,&#8221; and cited one individual&#8217;s online observation that &#8220;What the picture says, between the lines, is that you are asking for a better world for yourself as a white employer, and for your perfect family, while the black nanny continues to be a maid.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Eerily echoing the sentiment of Donald Trump&#8217;s slogan &#8220;Make America Great Again&#8221; are Brazilian protesters who say they &#8220;want their country back,&#8221; a parallel thread to right-wing American anger. Sections of Brazil&#8217;s middle and upper classes are seething with resentment over the perceived notion that liberal government forces have coddled poor people and ruined class distinctions. Of course, impoverished classes in Brazil and the U.S. never receive government subsidies big enough to fully lift them out of poverty.Sadly, the PT is not helping its own cause. Over the past several years, the party has adopted austerity measures and environmentally disastrous policies that have alienated its base of working-class communities. Figueroa cited mass demonstrations in 2013 as an expression of anger that lower-middle-class Brazilians felt over the nation&#8217;s economic downtown. During that era of upheaval, she said, &#8220;There were two sides. There was a left wing that was demanding more services, more redistribution, more help for people.&#8221; But &#8220;[t]here was [also] a right wing which took this anti-corruption narrative and ran with it, aided by Globo.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Conservatives were able to exploit public anger so well that the last congressional elections yielded huge wins for opposition parties. Among them was the &#8220;Ruralistas,&#8221; a bloc representing land-owning elites, which has directly targeted redistribution policies and the rights of indigenous communities.</p> \n\n<p>PT supporters have taken to the streets in counterprotests to defend the party&#8217;s stated adherence to policies that benefit poor and working-class Brazilians. Despite the PT&#8217;s recent failures, there is an understanding that conservatives want to roll back the decade and a half of progressive reforms. One protester <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/police-fire-tear-gas-protests-against-brazils-president-023854502.html\" type=\"external\">defending Lula and Rousseff</a> told Agence France-Presse, &#8220;This is a coup by the right.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Liberal parties like the PT face a conundrum in Latin American democracies&#8212;one that Venezuela&#8217;s Bolivarian revolution has had to navigate time and again&#8212;and that is that liberalism and its tolerance for political activity offer openings to right-wing parties that have no qualms about exploiting democratic expression (such as a free press, the right to assemble publicly, etc.) in order to quash democracy.</p> \n\n<p>The stakes are high, especially in Brazil, where climate policies can have a global impact. Already, Figueroa is noticing that in the Brazilian Amazon, &#8220;As soon as this political crisis began, there was a push to run over all of the regulations and the governmental protections that have been put into place for the rain forest.&#8221; Indigenous groups and environmental activists had managed, among other things, to institutionalize curbs on deforestation through the PT. But in the past year, rates of deforestation, which had been declining, jumped back up.</p> \n\n<p>The BBC <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-35831833\" type=\"external\">characterized the situation</a> with a headline that read, &#8220;Brazil tumbles like &#8216;House of Cards&#8217; in crisis.&#8221; Figueroa does not think this is an overstatement. &#8220;What the right wing seeks is the complete destruction of the Workers Party, the real gains that the population has made, and the remaining barriers to unfettered capitalist development,&#8221; she said. Unless the PT and its supporters can stave off the attacks, Brazil may indeed go the way of Ecuador and Honduras.</p>", "title": "\u2018This Is a Coup\u2019: Brazil's Workers Party Faces Its Greatest Test", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/this-is-a-coup-brazils-workers-party-faces-its-greatest-test/", "published_at": "2016-03-24", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>In their biggest plunge in just over a year, shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) tumbled more than 7% Tuesday morning as investors fret over the tech titan&#8217;s <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">lower-than-expected iPhone sales</a> and cautious guidance.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>The focus on iPhone sales and guidance for the fiscal second quarter overshadowed a solid earnings beat for the consumer-electronics giant.</p> \n\n<p>Still, Apple&#8217;s results prompted a slew of analysts to trim their price targets on the company&#8217;s shares as concerns persist about heavy competition in the smartphone market.</p> \n\n<p>Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) cut its valuation range on Apple to between $505 and $575, down from $536 to $581 previously.

The series has already been a Twitter meme, and once it begins airing this weekend, there will be rushes to compare Pius to President-elect Donald Trump, or to draw parallels between Pius&#8217; battles with Cardinal Voiello (Silvio Orlando) and Netflix&#8217;s remake of &#8220;House of Cards.&#8221;* I suspect that people who insist on those readings will find &#8220;The Young Pope&#8221; unsatisfying and not merely because it&#8217;s the kind of show that involves a papal kangaroo, hippie ghosts and dance breaks involving the prime minister of Greenland.</p> \n\n<p>What are we to make of Pius, who before he chose his papal name was known as Lenny Belardo?</p> \n\n<p>He drinks Cherry Coke for breakfast and smokes in the residences where it&#8217;s forbidden; he insists on seeing the gifts sent to him, which include the aforementioned kangaroo and a cigarette lighter; among his first priorities as pope is buying back the tiara of Pope Paul VI; he wears white track suits, which along with the Cherry Coke is one of the more American items on this list.</p> \n\n<p>He&#8217;s also an orphan, raised by Sister Mary (Diane Keaton), who he brings to the Vatican as soon as he assumes his office; he refuses to pose for photos or to allow the creation of new papal memorabilia, and when he sends Sister Mary to meet with the press, it&#8217;s only to tell them that he wishes &#8220;to inform you of my indifference&#8221;; he was elected as a blank slate but turns out to be a radically conservative figure; he confides in his confessor, Don Tommaso (Marcello Romolo), rather than playing Vatican politics.</p> \n\n<p>But, as is the case with the papacy, the man is subordinate to the office. And while &#8220;The Young Pope&#8221; has been marketed as a story about what an American might bring to an institution that&#8217;s international but still highly Italian, the series is at its most powerful when it&#8217;s something far stranger than that.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Sorrentino excels at keeping viewers off-base in the way Cardinal Voiello feels constantly. He composes ghostly, graceful images of nuns at work and play. He knows that choosing simple clothes is one way to convey humility and a distaste for worldly things, but that casually smoking a cigarette while dressed in the grandest possible imperial regalia goes beyond distaste to contempt. You can read things like that kangaroo, or a scene that uses the music of LMFAO as pretentious, but then, taste is one way of designating a zone in which we&#8217;re comfortable.</p> \n\n<p>Which is not to say that the questions &#8220;The Young Pope&#8221; asks are not relevant to us. A sex-abuse scandal hangs in the background of the early episodes, but &#8220;The Young Pope&#8221; largely concerns itself with more philosophical matters.</p> \n\n<p>What does it mean for a man to not merely cloister himself away from the world, but to withdraw into the innermost sanctum of that cloister? How would an ordinary man respond when others believe he has been the agent of a miracle? What sort of fortitude would it require for a man to conceal his intentions for decades? How might that silence change his character, and how might he behave when he is given the opportunity to begin acting on those intentions? And most of all, how might skilled practitioners of ordinary politics respond to a figure who so thoroughly confounds their expectations, playing by rules they cannot fathom?</p> \n\n<p>The only thing &#8220;The Young Pope&#8221; has in common with &#8220;House of Cards&#8221; is that it&#8217;s a story about what might happen if Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), who has a few things in common with Cardinal Voiello, found himself playing not politics but an obscure form of intergalactic chess.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Mystery is a serious matter,&#8221; Pius&#8217; mentor, Cardinal Michael Spencer (James Cromwell) warns his pupil. &#8220;It&#8217;s not some marketing strategy.&#8221; I can&#8217;t say that &#8220;The Young Pope&#8221; sincerely gets to the heart of any great mystery.

Utah has one of the worst gender gaps in the country in college graduation rates, and the depth of the education gap may be further masked by all the bachelor&#8217;s degrees given out by church-owned Brigham Young University in &#8220; <a href=\"https://familylife.byu.edu/\" type=\"external\">family and consumer sciences,</a>&#8221; with college courses like &#8220;Preparation for Marriage,&#8221; interior design, and food preparation in the home&#8212;classes dominated by women.</p> \n\n<p>The state has extensive abortion restrictions, and until just recently BYU made a practice of <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/29/health/brigham-young-university-rape/\" type=\"external\">punishing students who were the victims of sexual assault</a>, with collusion from the local Provo police department, which reported them to the school. It&#8217;s not a place where women were likely feeling empowered to be &#8220;with her.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I think that internalized misogyny is what will ultimately lead Mormon women to vote against their best interests,&#8221; predicted Utah activist Kate Kelly when I spoke with her last month. Kelly is a Mormon feminist who was ex-communicated from the church in 2014 for advocating the ordination of women, so she has some experience in this department. &#8220;They won&#8217;t say, &#8216;I&#8217;m not voting for Hillary because she&#8217;s a woman.&#8217; They&#8217;ll use coded language. &#8216;She&#8217;s deceitful, she&#8217;s too shrill, she&#8217;s immoral.'&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The education deficit between men and women in the state may have reduced the likelihood that the state&#8217;s women would vote for Clinton, given Trump&#8217;s success with less educated voters. One of the reasons Trump lagged in the polls nationally is that women deserted him in droves, with Clinton <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/election-update-women-are-defeating-donald-trump/\" type=\"external\">leading among women</a>, at various points, by between 15 and 33 points. That wasn&#8217;t the case in Utah, where <a href=\"https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/MonmouthPoll_UT_110316/\" type=\"external\">polls heading into the election</a> showed a small gender difference, with 40 percent of men and 33 percent of women backing Trump.</p> \n\n<p>Clinton put Utahans, particularly Mormon women, in a genuine bind. &#8220;It&#8217;s this interesting conundrum, where we can&#8217;t vote for Trump because he&#8217;s an unmitigated slimeball, but we can&#8217;t vote for Hillary because she&#8217;s everything we&#8217;re taught not to be,&#8221; says Kelly. &#8220;She&#8217;s the opposite of the pedestal paradigm that Mormon women are told to strive for. She works outside the home. She doesn&#8217;t cook. She talks powerfully and stridently about important high-level issues. All of these things are very frowned upon by Mormon women, and in a way, they&#8217;re afraid of them.&#8221; And in the end, Kelly says, to vote for Clinton, Mormon women might have to take a hard look at their own faith. &#8220;If women can&#8217;t be leaders in our church but they can be the leader of the free world,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what does that say about our church?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Hillary Clinton Was Never Going to Win Utah", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2016/11/why-hillary-lost-utah/", "published_at": "2016-11-09", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>The Taos County manager, Adam Baker, plans to resign early next year, <a href=\"http://www.taosnews.com/articles/2010/10/21/news/doc4cc07d7dec96f892715054.txt\" type=\"external\">The Taos News</a> reported.</p> \n\n<p>The newspaper said the move was announced after county commissioners met in executive session at their meeting on Tuesday (Oct. 19).</p> \n\n<p>Baker, who was hired in March to a one-year, $110,000 contract, could not be reached for comment, according to The News.</p> \n\n<p>Commission Chairman Dan Barrone told the newspaper Thursday that Baker would remain in the position until the end of January.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Baker had served as assistant county attorney, county attorney and interim county manager before becoming county manager replacing Sammy Pachecho, who retired in December 2009, The News reported.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "Taos County Manager Plans To Resign", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/9895/taos-county-manager-plans-to-resign.html", "published_at": "", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>Ukraine's ousted president Viktor Yanukovych on Friday condemned Western powers as \"irresponsible\" and accused them of \"pandering to\" the 'Euromaidan' protesters who occupied central Kiev.</p> \n\n<p>In his <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">first public appearance since fleeing Ukraine</a>, he said the deaths in last week's clashes were \"consequences of a political crisis.\"</p> \n\n<p>\"This is the result of irresponsible policies of the West,\" the defiant ex-president told reporters at a news conference in neighboring Russia. \"But Ukraine is a strong country and we will get out.\"</p> \n\n<p>He said opposition groups had reneged on a Feb. 21 deal that had been witnessed by witnessed by the foreign ministers of three European nations.</p> \n\n<p>As a result, he said, Kiev was \"taken over by armed people who&#8230; robbed and beat people on the streets.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>He also described as &#8220;illegal&#8221; the May 25 elections proposed by Ukraine&#8217;s interim rulers, calling instead for constitutional reforms followed by a poll in December.</p> \n\n<p>He added that the separatist demonstrations in Crimea were an &#8220;absolutely natural reaction&#8221; to what he described as &#8220;nationalist bandits in Kiev.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Yanukovych said he chose Rostov-on-Don \"because an old friend of mine lives nearby\" and he wanted find temporary shelter.</p> \n\n<p>His appearance in Russia came despite <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Ukraine's General Prosecutor Office calling on Russia to extradite him</a> to face charges of corruption and for his role in the death of protesters in Kiev.</p>", "title": "Yanukovych Blames \u2018Irresponsible\u2019 West for Backing Protesters", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "http://nbcnews.com/storyline/ukraine-crisis/yanukovych-blames-irresponsible-west-backing-protesters-n41011", "published_at": "2014-02-28", "bias": 3}, {"text": "<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\" />It&#8217;s 2003 all over again, as Iraq &#8220;experts&#8221; who promoted the 2003 invasion are back on TV screens offering expert analysis about what to do next.

To Donald J. Trump goes the distinction of having been caught in verbal flagrante&#8212;bragging about his attacks on women as he bantered off-camera&#8212;so he thought&#8212;with an accommodating interviewer. Despite the chorus of victims who confirmed his boasts, Americans elected him president.</p> \n\n<p>Males have lorded it over females for millennia. Men of every race, religion, and party have abused women.&amp;#160; Now we &amp;#160;like to think that moral standards have been raised.&amp;#160; We take it for granted that gender exploitation is a violation of basic human rights.&amp;#160; Accordingly, Democrats have pressed Senators John Conyers and Al Franken to leave the Senate under the shadow of gender-abuse scandals.</p> \n\n<p>In sharp contrast, the Republican responses to scandal leave us uncertain who we really are.. Despite Roy Moore&#8217;s reputation as a pedophile, his Senate candidacy was backed by Trump and the Republican National Committee. Moore&#8217;s ambiguous denial of the charges (&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember&#8230; dating any girl without the permission of her mother.&#8221;) was supposed to exonerate him.&amp;#160; Most Republicans in Congress (as well as the White House) demonstrated their readiness to jettison their vaunted principles to get one more yes vote (for a bill that, along with&amp;#160; other cruelties, hurts women.)</p> \n\n<p>As with Moore, so Trump: &amp;#160;most Republicans appear deaf, dumb, and blind to the president&#8217;s predatory past, his use of office for his own profit-making, his peculiar links to Putin&#8217;s Russia, his attacks on the FBI and the U.S. intelligence community, and his various trespasses against the Constitution.</p> \n\n<p>What explains Republican apathy to amoral or, rather, immoral behavior in high places? Is age a factor?&amp;#160; Trump is 71; Moore, 70; The average age in the House is now 58 and the Senate 62.&amp;#160; Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell is 75; senior Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer, &amp;#160;67. (Speaker of House Paul Ryan is a spring chicken at 47.). Have older men abandoned their ideals&#8212;or has hypocrisy always ruled the day?</p> \n\n<p>On the other hand, the distaff side of Congress is not resigned to male bullying. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (herself age 77) and many of the 89 women in the House and 21 in the Senate do care. Pelosi is one of many women who pressured Conyers and Franken to resign.</p> \n\n<p>Republican attitudes toward gender abuse is part of a larger indifference to basic morality and to patriotic love of country. Here is their version of the Ten Commandments (quite different from the one Judge Moore claimed to revere):&amp;#160; Greed more than age would explain this syndrome.</p> \n\n<p>+ Jigger the tax system to reward donors to our party regardless the impact on national debt and collateral damage to health, welfare, and education.

Tear down net neutrality and let the biggest companies rule the air waves. Remove Obama-era efforts to protect learners from for-profit colleges like the erstwhile Trump University.

Concomitantly, we need to stop using &#8220;offended&#8221; as a synonym for &#8220;structural harm&#8221; or &#8220;oppression&#8221; in everyday political discourse.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>It has to be one of the most significant rhetorical own-goals of the Left since the 1960s: allowing the word &#8220;offend&#8221; to become the go-to way of describing the harms of prejudice. &#8220;This content offends me,&#8221; &#8220;your words are offensive,&#8221; &#8220;his conduct gave offence to x,&#8221; etc. What this has always facilitated is the commonplace reactionary response to such moral injunctions, defending some imagined noble right to give offense lardered with <a href=\"http://theshake.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/offended.jpg\" type=\"external\">smug Stephen Fry image macros</a>. Cue &#8220;free speech&#8221; arguments ad nauseam that resolve into garrulous nothingness.</p> \n\n<p>We saw this play out in dramatic and unsettling fashion in <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">the wake of the massacre</a> of many of Charlie Hebdo&#8217;s staff in Paris last month, where many rallied around the newspaper&#8217;s &#8220;offensive&#8221; tradition and stood tall on the graves of the fallen, pencils raised in the air to announce that &#8220;offensiveness&#8221; was the cornerstone of a free press and our shared right to free expression, crowding out discussion of how the French media can promote hateful&amp;#160;stereotypes that deepen the country&#8217;s struggles with racism.</p> \n\n<p>This word, &#8220;offense,&#8221; is the devil in every detail of every argument and it needs to go. To use it to describe acts of prejudice is to cede much of a hotly contested epistemic field to those only too happy to make the discussion entirely about speech rights rather than material harm.</p> \n\n<p>Loathsome as such arguments are, they do contain a basic truth: there is no way to guarantee that one will never be offended, and individual offense ought not be the yardstick by which we measure civil rights and liberties. But then, virtually no one on the feminist or anti-racist Left has been calling for that in the first place. When we discuss being &#8220;offended&#8221; we are, more often than not, talking about people being hurt in material ways.</p> \n\n<p>This is not to dismiss the importance of emotion, of course. There is a parallel problem with our culture worshipping at wanton offensiveness&#8217; bonfire, which is that it can coarsen our discourse and cheapen the currency of offensiveness itself during those times when its barbs need to cut most deeply (such as when one is offending those in power). To acknowledge that it is impossible and even undesirable to control everyone&#8217;s feelings is not the same as arguing that offense is harmless, or that it should be done for its own sake, or that every offensive word and deed should be celebrated as some grand strike for Enlightenment values. There remains something pathetically immature and irresponsible about such ideas.</p> \n\n<p>But we must distinguish this set of issues from the question of material harm. Being made to fear for your life is not the same as feeling hurt by speech. Losing your job as a result of stereotypes or harassment contained in speech is not the same as feeling personally offended by that speech. Being shot by the police because of ideas about your skin color transmitted through discourse is not the same as merely being offended by it. Being outed against your will is not the same as having your feelings hurt by it. It is the deeds that flow from words which concern us, and which cannot be contained by the concept of offensiveness.</p> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p /> \n\n<p>***</p> \n\n<p>Part of the reason we are drowning in a discourse of offendedness has to do with the triumph of an individualist, un-structural reading of history in the wake of the 1960s civil rights movements which interpreted phenomena like racism as expressions of loud, individual derangement. To be a racist was to speak like Bull Connor, and thus in an offensive and hurtful register, rather than to be part of sustaining a system that gives those words power.</p> \n\n<p>This is why, as a whole society, we only condemn racism vociferously when an individual like Donald Sterling says the n-word out loud, while&amp;#160;Fox News can get away with &#8220;polite&#8221; race-baiting for ages because they studiously avoid &#8220;offensive&#8221; language. This ensures people apologize for &#8220;coarse language&#8221; rather than a hateful idea likely to cause violence. Similarly, in transphobic discourse, the T-word is often silent and therefore such speech is considered inherently less offensive and thus not prejudiced. This is the trap that orienting our discussion of oppression around &#8220;offense&#8221; leads us straight into.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Offense&#8221; discourse encourages every fallacious false-equivalence under the sun. The idea that calling a white person a &#8220;cracker&#8221; is racist stems from this discourse; if &#8220;offense&#8221; is your only yardstick for measuring prejudice, then yes, surely hurting feelings with that word is racist. But in the real world actual racism is not about hurt feelings. It&#8217;s about being incarcerated, harassed, strip-searched, stalked, murdered, denied career advancement or an education, or being at risk of the foregoing and then having someone rub in one&#8217;s face the slurs and stereotypes that animate it all. Against all this, the psychic paper cut&amp;#160;of &#8220;cracker&#8221; surely pales.</p> \n\n<p>We respond to prejudice in pointillist fashion: this individual said something that hurt this other individual; therefore &#8220;offense&#8221; is the best way to describe that harm. But the reality is that when we talk about something like, say, misgendering a trans woman or using her old name in public, what is happening in those situations transcends the individual offense felt by the woman in question. That is part of her experience of the event, and part of the harm, but it is not in itself a political matter. What is political, in no uncertain terms, is the way such words and ideas are the spearpoint of&amp;#160;violence against trans women, <a href=\"http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2014/06/03/watch-suspect-atlanta-beating-invokes-trans-panic-defense\" type=\"external\">used to justify it and all but ensure such crimes will be repeated</a>.

Republicans hold 33 governorships, compared with just 16 for Democrats, and the GOP has full control of the legislatures in two-thirds of the states.</p> \n\n<p>But there is a sense of unease for Republican governors in Democratic-leaning states. They criticize President Donald Trump gently, picking their spots to appease the Democratic and independent voters they need to remain in office. At the same time, they don&#8217;t want to alienate Trump supporters.</p> \n\n<p>For some, the best strategy is to avoid mentioning Trump at all.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Democrats sense an opening ahead of the 2018 elections and are taking any opportunity to link Republican governors to the president. Republicans will be defending 27 of the 38 governorships up for election this year and next. Nine of the GOP governors are in states Hillary Clinton carried last year.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I think what the Trump administration has done, it has really made every Republican governor out there &#8212; especially a moderate Republican governor in a Democratic state &#8212; it has made them very vulnerable,&#8221; said Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat and chairman of the National Governors Association.</p> \n\n<p>Republican governors who face re-election next year in states that voted for Clinton are Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, Larry Hogan of Maryland, Bruce Rauner of Illinois, Phil Scott of Vermont and Chris Sununu of New Hampshire. Four other states that voted for Clinton have governors who will be forced out by term limits: Chris Christie in New Jersey; Paul LePage in Maine; Susana Martinez in New Mexico; and Brian Sandoval in Nevada.</p> \n\n<p>Sandoval, vice chairman of the governors association, said he is comfortable being the face of moderate GOP governors across the country. He has urged caution on Trump&#8217;s pledges to repeal President Barack Obama&#8217;s health care law and build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Sandoval said he believes he and other moderates can work productively with Trump and his Cabinet.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re five weeks into the administration, so I think it&#8217;s really premature to start drawing conclusions now, with regard to what the implication could be in future elections,&#8221; he said.</p> \n\n<p>Heading into the upcoming governors&#8217; races, the Republican Governors&#8217; Association is better-funded, having raised $60.7 million in 2016, compared with $39 million by the Democratic Governors&#8217; Association. The RGA has tried to paint Democratic challengers as too liberal and out of touch with mainstream America.</p> \n\n<p>This weekend&#8217;s bipartisan governors&#8217; gathering includes an audience with Trump and leading Republicans in Congress. Governors of both parties are concerned with a full range of proposals that could affect state budgets, including possible repeal of the Affordable Care Act, reforms to Medicaid, immigration enforcement and spending for infrastructure.</p> \n\n<p>Republican governors in Democratic-leaning states are especially vulnerable if policies put forward by Trump and the GOP Congress are disruptive in the states.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>Baker, a moderate with high approval ratings in a state politically dominated by Democrats, has distanced himself from Trump since early in the presidential campaign. He said he left his presidential ballot blank.</p> \n\n<p>After the election, the Massachusetts governor promised to forge constructive ties between the state and the new administration. But he has not hesitated to criticize White House policies, including the travel ban aimed at seven majority-Muslim nations that sowed confusion in the U.S. and abroad. He publicly backed the state&#8217;s attorney general, a Democrat, when her office filed a lawsuit to block Trump&#8217;s action.</p> \n\n<p>During the women&#8217;s march after the presidential inauguration, Baker was just blocks away as protesters flooded Boston Common. Defending his absence, he said he was working on time-sensitive matters and said it was not an intentional snub.</p> \n\n<p>In Maryland, Hogan &#8212; who has enjoyed approval ratings higher than 70 percent &#8212; also said throughout the presidential campaign that he would not vote for Trump. On his presidential ballot, he wrote in the name of his father, a former congressman.</p> \n\n<p>Since the president took office, he has continually sidestepped questions about Trump. Even in a friendly interview on a Baltimore rock radio station, he made clear he was weary of the subject.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m focused on solving Maryland problems,&#8221; Hogan said. &#8220;I have 31 different policy proposals and a real agenda to turn our state around, and the only questions we get (are) &#8216;Why aren&#8217;t you protesting Donald Trump?&#8217; and &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you go to BWI (Airport) to do this or that?&#8217; I don&#8217;t see that as my role.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Democrats, who control the Legislature and enjoy a 2-to-1 advantage in voter registration, went against Hogan&#8217;s wishes when they voted to expand the attorney general&#8217;s powers in response to Trump. And they&#8217;re not nearly as shy about mentioning the president.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The governor seems unwilling to stand up to Mr. Trump, and so that will fall to the Democrats,&#8221; state Sen. Jim Rosapepe said.</p> \n\n<p>As with the other governors, Rauner in Illinois said he is focusing on his state &#8212; or at least he&#8217;s trying to. He went to great lengths not to stake a clear position on Trump during the campaign &#8212; refusing to comment on the race, who he was voting for or even to say Trump&#8217;s name. Since the election, he has continued to avoid taking a clear position on the administration&#8217;s policies.</p> \n\n<p>His strategy is clearly intended to avoid alienating voters in Chicago, the suburbs and other urban areas who supported Hillary Clinton in November, or those in rural counties that went overwhelmingly for Trump. But avoidance also comes with some peril: Democrats, who control the Illinois Legislature, called the Republican governor cowardly for meeting with billionaire donors out of state while refugees were stranded at Chicago&#8217;s O&#8217;Hare airport after the president&#8217;s travel-banning executive order.</p> \n\n<p>Rauner already has a slim margin for error after a two-year budget stalemate has tanked his approval ratings.</p> \n\n<p>Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, senses a change after recent elections went overwhelmingly in the Republicans&#8217; favor.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Clearly, the wave was against Democrats in &#8217;10 and it was against Democrats to some extent in &#8217;14, but I suspect it&#8217;s going to be against Republicans just as strongly,&#8221; Malloy said. &#8220;Can you overcome that? Absolutely, you can overcome that, but you have to overcome that by separating yourself (from Trump).&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Associated Press writers Sara Burnett in Chicago, Morgan Lee in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Bob Salsberg in Boston and Brian Witte in Annapolis, Maryland, contributed to this report.</p> \n\n<p>___</p> \n\n<p>Follow Ben Nuckols on Twitter at https://twitter.com/APBenNuckols .</p>", "title": "Best tactic for some governors is to avoid mention of Trump", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://abqjournal.com/956537/trump-puts-moderate-gop-governors-in-awkward-spot.html", "published_at": "2017-02-24", "bias": 2}, {"text": "<p>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa &#8211; Towering over downtown Johannesburg is a huge cylindrical skyscraper, a red banner at its crown with one word printed in white, &#8216;Vodacom&#8217;&#8212;the name of the largest telecommunications company in South Africa. The tower reminds onlookers of the importance the telecommunications sector plays in this nation of 53 million citizens, where there are more active mobile SIM cards then there are people.</p> \n\n<p>The dominance of mobile technology is hard to miss in South Africa. The country has one of the highest mobile subscriber penetrations in sub-Saharan Africa. Advertisements for companies like Vodacom litter the airwaves and online. In a city like Johannesburg, there are few residents who aren&#8217;t connected to the rest of the world through a cellphone.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>For South Africans, having a cellphone means more than just socializing. It also means having a portal to access information and connect with health services.</p> \n\n<p>Young Africa Live, a mobile platform designed to facilitate discussions among young South Africans on sex, relationships and HIV/AIDS, is just one example of a program geared to improving health outcomes using mobile technology in the country. The project has over 1.8 million users.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Young Africa Live is part of a broader global effort called &#8216;mHealth,&#8217; which uses cell phones for projects ranging from monitoring stock supplies of medicine in rural areas to sending test results to health workers from labs. According to GSMA mHealth Tracker, a project launched by a London-based global telecommunications industry trade group, there are nearly 100 mHealth projects in South Africa&#8212;the country has one of the highest concentrations of mHealth projects in the world.</p> \n\n<p>The key to understanding the popularity of these programs in South Africa, and elsewhere around the world in the health sector, is the changing social dynamics behind what is making them possible, said Ananya Raihan, executive director of Dnet, a non-profit organization in Bangladesh committed to tackling poverty through technological innovations. Raihan was in Johannesburg this month for a <a href=\"http://www.who.int/pmnch/about/governance/partnersforum/pf2014/en/index1.html\" type=\"external\">global conference</a> on maternal health. And while his work in the mHealth field is in Bangladesh, his perspective holds true for South Africa as well.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>In Bangladesh, he said, the promise and spread of technology reach even the most remote villages, where people transport car batteries and use solar power to charge their phones. A smartphone can cost $65 USD, he said, which can be a whole months salary in Bangladesh. But people are willing to prioritize that purchase over other life necessities such as having food three times per day, he said.&amp;#160;In the capital&amp;#160;city, <a href=\"http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2014/05/31/36894\" type=\"external\">news reports</a> show that sales of smartphones have reached around&amp;#160;40 percent in mobile phone shops.</p> \n\n<p>Raihan said this kind of tradeoff happens in many countries across the global south, including South Africa. For this reason, the public health community has been aggressive in its effort to leverage mobile technology for health.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>But just because people have phones and are connected to mHealth projects, it does not necessarily mean the health projects are effective. While reporting in Johannesburg, I&#8217;ve discovered that one of the primary issues facing the mHealth community is proving that the projects actually work and bringing them to scale.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Many mHealth projects boast of how many people have signed up for the program, but fall short in evidence on whether those people behind those numbers have had their health improve. One of the problems is that gathering evidence often takes long periods of time, according to Smisha Agarwal, an associate at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In the case of mHealth, sometimes the technology advances at a quicker pace than researchers are able to study them. According to some people I spoke with, the projects are also not well-integrated into the broader health efforts across the country.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;There are so many initiatives and no coordination between them,&#8221; said Thembeka Gwagwa, general secretary of the Democratic Nursing Organisation of South Africa, a national trade union. Local stakeholders, like her trade union, are often not consulted before projects are launched, she said.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Even some of the biggest proponents of the mHealth sector agree. Patricia Mechael, executive director of the mHealth Alliance, a coalition of organizations aimed at advancing mHealth programs around the world, told me that there are thousands of mHealth projects globally, but many of these fail, never reaching a point where they are brought to scale. To Mechael, who was also in town for the maternal health conference, working in the mHealth field \"like flying and building a plane at the same time.\"&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;MHealth is still such a new field that when you start to engage these programs at a larger scale, and integrate them with larger health systems, it&#8217;s not always clear from the outset what is going to work, how it is going to work and why it is going to work,&#8221; she said.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>On one of my last days in the country, I spent the day with Sikhomzile Sibanda, a young mother of two who received text message support during her pregnancy and post-pregnancy through one of these mHealth projects, called MAMA. As we sat in Sibanda&#8217;s one-bedroom apartment she began reading to me some of the messages she had recently received.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;There is this one. It says: &#8216;Think about what to take with you when you give birth. You may need things like sanitary pads, pajamas, toiletries and clothes for the baby,&#8217;&#8221; she told me. &#8220;I like that one.&#8221;&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Sibanda had her child seven weeks ago, and had brought all the recommended items to the hospital.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Gwagwa&#8217;s and Mechael&#8217;s words of caution linger in my mind. But in my two weeks of reporting here I&#8217;ve seen that mHealth, for the time being, is a way to reach mothers like Sibanda.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>After spending an entire day with her, I saw that there were just a few things she kept glued to her side: her two sons and her cell phone, which she continuously wiped out of her pocket, checking for updates from family and friends. &amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>More from GlobalPost: <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/global-pulse/texts-deliver-health-advice\" type=\"external\">Mother's helper?

Yes, I am predicting that <a href=\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2012/11/05/much-of-the-media-is-calling-the-presidential-race-for-barack-obama.html\" type=\"external\">Barack Obama will win</a>, but since I need to get a whole column out of this, let me build slowly and methodically toward the dramatic conclusion.</p> \n\n<p>First, let me start with this somewhat astonishing (I think) observation. The numbers I&#8217;m about to give you? I could have given you this exact same Electoral College prediction in June. Or March. Or January. Or probably even last year. For all the twists and turns, all the debates, all the news developments expected and unexpected, the basic math of this election hasn&#8217;t changed barely a whit to my eye. It was always close and still is. The electoral map always favored Obama and still does. It&#8217;s almost as if we could have had this election months ago, sparing the nation billions of dollars and a lot of agita.</p> \n\n<p>Another point I want to make before starting. It&#8217;s worth bearing in mind in several cases, as I show below, that Obama won by some pretty big margins in some important states in 2008, so he can afford drop-offs of 7 or 8 percent in some states, or at least 5 percent, and still win them. You might want to look back over some of those 2008 margins before you settle into your easy chair tonight.</p> \n\n<p>Now, I <a href=\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2012/11/03/the-states-that-matter.html\" type=\"external\">begin with the states</a> that are automatic Democratic states&#8212;states where neither candidate is even contesting matters. Those states add up to 201 electoral votes (yes, George Will, this includes Minnesota).</p> \n\n<p>Then let&#8217;s take three states that are being contested this time but have been voting Democratic at least since Bill Clinton. These are Pennsylvania (Democratic since 1992), Michigan (also since 1992), and Wisconsin (since 1988). Some Republicans are hoping to snare at least one of these states.</p> \n\n<p>Are these states really in play? Granting that nobody knows anything until the votes are counted, I&#8217;d have to say it&#8217;s highly unlikely. States that have been voting one way for nearly a generation could flip from this column to that. But generally speaking they do so only in a real wave election. This is not a wave election, or at least it certainly doesn&#8217;t feel and smell like it is. There is no strong momentum right now in one direction or the other. This race now is just two big lumbering dinosaurs pushing against each other.</p> \n\n<p>Now, if unemployment were still 9 percent and the most recent jobs number was 50,000, then I could totally see it. It would be a wave election, and that wave would sweep Obama away. There&#8217;s no question that these states will be a lot closer this time&#8212;in 2008, Obama won Michigan by more than 16 points, Wisconsin by around 14, and Pennsylvania by 10. We&#8217;re more likely looking at margins of less than half those. They may all be within five points. But it doesn&#8217;t smell like we&#8217;re in an election that actually shifts them.</p> \n\n<p>So put these two categories, the automatic and the pretty strong leaners, together. They lift Obama to 247.</p> \n\n<p>Romney&#8217;s automatic total is 191. Then I guess we throw him North Carolina. I actually don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s at all insane to think Obama could pull an upset there. All depends on turnout. But the Democratic Party in the state is in pretty weak condition right now. I&#8217;m being a tad generous here since many polls show this within the margin of error, but generous is the kind of guy I am, as you well know, so I&#8217;ll put Romney&#8217;s automatic plus lean total at 206.</p> \n\n<p>That leaves seven states that combine to 85 electoral votes: Florida (29), Ohio (18), Virginia (13), Colorado (9), Iowa (6), Nevada (6), and New Hampshire (4). These are where the game will be decided. From the math, you can see that Obama needs just 23 of these 85, while Romney needs 64 of them.</p> \n\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the easier ones. It appears from most of what I&#8217;m seeing that Nevada is banked in Obama&#8217;s column, and that Iowa is close to banked. So that gets Obama up to 259, just 11 electoral votes away.</p> \n\n<p>I will give Florida to Romney. It&#8217;s totally up in the air, I think, and could go either way. But until it&#8217;s proven otherwise, I say that the weight of most polls is probably pretty accurate, and the aggregate of Florida polls seems to me to lean very slightly toward Romney. So that gets him to 235. Four states to go.</p> \n\n<p>Start and finish your day with the top stories from The Daily Beast.</p> \n\n<p>A speedy, smart summary of all the news you need to know (and nothing you don't).</p> \n\n<p>I&#8217;ll toss New Hampshire into Obama&#8217;s column. It&#8217;s not so different from Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, except that it did go for George W. Bush in 2000. Again, I look at 2008 margins. Obama won it by 10 percent, so he has a cushion here as well. Polls suggests he should be able to eke out a win of three points or so. That&#8217;s four more EVs, or 263.</p> \n\n<p>We are left with Colorado, Virginia, and Ohio. I&#8217;m going to give Colorado to Romney by a very slim margin. Obama has tended to lead there, but I&#8217;m just going to do it, for two reasons. First, I think Colorado swing voters are probably a little more libertarian than Eastern swing voters, which means a few more Romney votes from them. Second, I just don&#8217;t think Obama has quite enough momentum that everything is going to tumble his way. That gets Romney to 244.</p> \n\n<p>And that&#8217;s where he stops. Obama takes Ohio and Virginia. In Ohio, I think he&#8217;s pretty clearly ahead. It&#8217;s what the polls say. Virginia is more mixed, but it&#8217;s my hunch.</p> \n\n<p>So: Obama 294, Romney 244. No Floridas, no hanging chads, no Supreme Courts. A lot of states will be close, but I think it will be clear enough.

It's a sacrament, \"until death do us part.\"&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Catholics in the US still get divorced at about the same rate as non-Catholics.&amp;#160;But for those seeking to get remarried in the church, the process just got a bit easier.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Pope Francis has paved the way for divorced Catholics to go through the process of getting an annulment a lot faster. It will also be&amp;#160;free of charge.</p> \n\n<p>The Vatican, of course, still considers marriage to be a sacrament&amp;#160;and it will maintain its ban on divorce. The way&amp;#160;an annulment works is that it grants&amp;#160;religious dispensation for someone who's been&amp;#160;divorced and wants to&amp;#160;get remarried. In essence, an annulment is a religious&amp;#160;ruling&amp;#160;that says the marriage was not valid in the first place, for one of several possible reasons.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>\"Therefore, the person can get married a second time,\" says Rev. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit priest and senior analyst with the National Catholic Reporter. \"In fact, in the church's eyes, the person is getting married for the first time.\"</p> \n\n<p>In the past, annulments were&amp;#160;obtained through a tribunal process that required two levels of approval. That process can now be handled at the level of each archdiocese, with bishops having the responsibility to set up tribunals, who must be clergy, or act as judges themselves. Critics of the old rules&amp;#160;long complained that the process could be time-consuming, frustrating and costly. The changes will go into effect in early December, out of \"concern for the salvation of souls.\"</p> \n\n<p>Recommendations to streamline the annulment process came from Catholic bishops&amp;#160;who called for&amp;#160;changes at a meeting last year in Rome.&amp;#160;&#8220;A great number of synod fathers emphasized the need to make the procedure in cases of nullity more accessible and less time-consuming,&#8221;&amp;#160;reads a final document <a href=\"http://www.cruxnow.com/church/2015/09/08/pope-francis-streamlines-process-for-granting-annulments/\" type=\"external\">produced from the meeting</a>.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>\"[Pope Francis] wants the Church to be more like a field hospital, rather than a bureaucracy,\" Reese says. \"A field hospital that gathers the wounded, binds the wounds, cares for people with compassion and love and sensitivity.

They struggled with them every day, they said, but they were intractable. We&#8217;d just have to live with the status quo, they warned, and woe be to those who tried to change it.</p> \n\n<p>They also told us that globalization is an irreversible trend, that it&#8217;s therefore impossible to rescue manufacturing jobs, that the economy and the world are in a certain order and that only the foolish or naive would seek to overturn it.</p> \n\n<p>Then Mr. Trump arrived on the scene.</p> \n\n<p>For a new hire who doesn&#8217;t start work for another six weeks, he has been a whirling dervish of decision-making, deal-making and status quo-busting.</p> \n\n<p>The man hasn&#8217;t even clocked in yet, and he&#8217;s already saving American jobs, reassuring allies, striking fear and anxiety in our enemies and standing for freedom and free enterprise.</p> \n\n<p>He began by leveraging the power of the presidency to negotiate a deal with Carrier to keep approximately 1,100 jobs in the United States rather than transfer them to Mexico as the company had planned. He and vice president-elect Mike Pence, who also serves as the governor of Indiana where the Carrier facility in question is located, offered a mix of state-based tax and other incentives to convince the company to retain the American workers.</p> \n\n<p>Criticism of the deal from the right (charges of interference in the free market) and from the left (charges of hypocrisy toward those who opposed President Obama&#8217;s economic interventions) were muted. And for good reason.</p> \n\n<p>To the working class, making America great again was always about restoring respect and validity to their lives and livelihoods. In striking the deal with Carrier to keep those jobs in the United States, Mr. Trump delivered on the core promise of his campaign: that he sees these hardworking Americans, hears them, respects them and will deliver for them. He has already demonstrated that he will put their interests on par with &#8212; or even ahead of &#8212; those of the rich, powerful and influential.</p> \n\n<p>They now believe that the soon-to-be most powerful person in the world is on their side.</p> \n\n<p>That is economic and political dynamite.</p> \n\n<p>In fact, a Morning Consult/Politico poll released this week shows just how big a win it was. A whopping 60 percent of voters said Mr. Trump&#8217;s intervention with Carrier made them view him more favorably. &#8220;Rarely do we see numbers that high when looking at how specific messages and events shape public opinion,&#8221; Kyle Dropp, Morning Consult co-founder and chief research officer, told Politico.</p> \n\n<p>Further, Mr. Trump&#8217;s favorability rose across party lines: four out of 10 Democrats said they now view him more favorably, as do 54 percent of independents. Even 32 percent of Hillary Clinton voters said the deal improved their view of Mr. Trump.</p> \n\n<p>More good news for Mr. Trump and his economic approach: 56 percent of voters said it&#8217;s appropriate for the president to negotiate directly with companies on a case-by-case basis, and 62 percent said they would approve of the president offering tax breaks and incentives to individual businesses if it means retaining American jobs.</p> \n\n<p>Less than a week after the Carrier pronouncement, Mr. Trump struck a deal of a different kind. After he met with the CEO of Japanese tech company SoftBank, the company announced that it will invest $50 billion in the United States, creating up to 50,000 new jobs. The dealmaker at work.</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Trump&#8217;s economic plan is designed to make the country more competitive by implementing policies that apply to all companies: cutting taxes, including the corporate tax rate, repealing and rolling back stifling regulations, including the biggest of them all, Obamacare and those clobbering the energy sector, renegotiating trade deals such as NAFTA, and killing off the nascent Trans-Pacific Partnership. Through Mr. Trump&#8217;s leadership and initiative, he&#8217;s already started resuscitating manufacturing and leveling the playing field by putting American workers first.</p> \n\n<p>No wonder Democrats are panicked. Mr. Trump is winning over the working class, perhaps permanently, by honoring their work enough to save their jobs &#8212; something politicians have constantly said was impossible to do.</p> \n\n<p>The intangible part of an economy is having people believe in that economy. Half of the president&#8217;s job is to advance a pro-growth economic agenda that creates real wealth and prosperity for the American worker. The other half of his job is to sell the agenda with a sense of optimism to create the psychological environment for growth and prosperity.</p> \n\n<p>Mr. Trump isn&#8217;t even president yet, and he&#8217;s already doing both.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;What, like it&#8217;s hard?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8226; Monica Crowley is editor of online opinion at The Washington Times.</p> \n\n<p>Copyright &#169; 2018 The Washington Times, LLC. <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/xGjXcUKYsKxMeCUl1\" type=\"external\">Click here for reprint permission</a>.</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "Donald Trump and the art of getting it done", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://washingtontimes.com/news/2016/dec/7/donald-trump-and-the-art-of-getting-it-done/", "published_at": "2016-12-07", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>BMW is recalling nearly 49,000 motorcycles in the U.S. and Canada because flanges that hold the rear wheel can crack if bolts are too tight.</p> \n\n<p>The recall covers multiple models including certain 2005-2010 R1200GS and R1200RT motorcycles, as well as the 2006-2010 R1200GS Adventure and the 2007-2010 R1200R, 2007 R1200S and K1200R Sport.

In this regard, here are two excellent high-yield stocks worthy of your consideration.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Anheuser-Busch InBev.</p> \n\n<p>In the world of beer,Anheuser-Busch InBev(NYSE: BUD) is as dominant as they come. After its recent $100 billion acquisition of its former No. 1 competitor, SABMiller, AB InBev now commands nearly 30% of the global beer market. The combined company has a portfolio of more than 500 beers, including seven of the top 10 global beer brands and 18 brands that generate more than $1 billion in retail sales.</p> \n\n<p>AB InBev is now the world's first truly global brewer with operations in virtually every major beer market. And while growth in beer consumption has recently been sluggish in developed markets such as the U.S., the merger with SABMiller gives AB InBev a stronger position in high-growth developing regions, particularly in Africa.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>AB In Bev has also been <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2016/04/16/anheuser-busch-inbev-sa-shows-a-growing-appetite-f.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">snatching up craft beer brands Opens a New Window.</a> to expand its presence in this fast-growing segment of the massive U.S. market. Although this is still a small portion of its business, it makes the craft beer craze less of a threat than the bears would have you believe. In fact, higher-priced craft beer has made it easier for AB InBev to raise prices for its popular macrobrews, which has helped the company's revenue growth outstrip volume growth in recent years.</p> \n\n<p>But where the beer king really excels is in wringing profits out of each beer it sells. 3G Capital -- the Brazilian group that runs AB InBev -- has a strong track record of helping acquired businesses slash costs and boost profits, and investors should expect more of the same in the coming years. In fact, in its <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/03/02/anheuser-busch-inbev-polishes-off-a-tough.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">fourth-quarter earnings release Opens a New Window.</a>, management increased its guidance for synergies and cost savings related to the SABMiller merger to $2.8 billion, up from previous estimates of $2.45 billion. The company has already delivered on more than $800 million of that goal, and it expects to realize the remaining $2 billion over the next three to four years.</p> \n\n<p>During that time, management will be (wisely) prioritizing debt repayment, so AB InBev's dividend increases may be modest for the next few years. But its current yield is already sizable, at 3.6%, and the dividend should be well secured by the more than $20 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) the company expects to achieve once SABMiller is fully integrated.</p> \n\n<p>Even better, with its shares <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/02/19/after-falling-20-ab-inbev-is-a-fantastic-buy-for-s.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">down about 20% Opens a New Window.</a> from their 52-week highs due largely to some macroeconomic related -- and likely short-term -- struggles in Brazil, AB InBev's stock is currently trading at about 24 times analysts' earnings estimates for 2017 and 21 times 2018's estimates. That's quite a bargain for such a dominant company that's expected to grow earnings by more than 24% over the next half decade. As such, investors may wish to consider taking a sip of AB In-Bev stock today.</p> \n\n<p>Like AB InBev, Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) offers investors the potential for solid income generation and capital appreciation. The telecom giant's subscription-based, utility-like business generates strong and stable cash flow that it's then able to pass on to shareholders in the form of a steadily rising -- and currently 4.7% -- cash dividend stream.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://ycharts.com/companies/VZ\" type=\"external\">VZ</a> data by <a href=\"http://ycharts.com\" type=\"external\">YCharts Opens a New Window.</a>.</p> \n\n<p>Verizon's wireless network consistently <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/12/09/verizon-rootmetrics-lead-2016/\" type=\"external\">ranks Opens a New Window.</a> as the best in the industry, even as rivals such as T-Mobile US (NASDAQ: TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE: S) claim that they're chipping away at Verizon's lead.

The company announced an unlimited data plan that's likely to prove popular with consumers and that could win some customers away from its rivals. At the very least, it should help to preserve Verizon's high customer retention.</p> \n\n<p>Verizon is also making moves to diversify its revenue streams. One exciting area of focus is the Internet of Things space, where Verizon is <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/11/27/verizon-is-transforming-itself-into-an-iot-and-med.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">acquiring assets Opens a New Window.</a> to strengthen its technology and service offerings. The company's IoT ambitions appear promising, with revenue growth from Verizon's IoT services rising 21% year over year on a comparable basis -- and 60% when including acquisitions -- to $243 million in the fourth quarter. Although the business is currently small (by Verizon's standards), the <a href=\"http://www.fool.com/investing/2016/12/12/our-3-favorite-stocks-to-invest-in-the-internet-of.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">massive potential Opens a New Window.</a> of the Internet of Things could help this segment grow to become a significant portion of Verizon's revenue and profits in the years ahead.</p> \n\n<p>Verizon is also rumored to be considering beefing up its pay-TV assets. Cable giant Charter Communications (NASDAQ: CHTR) is one company that's rumored to be a <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2017/01/31/comcast-shouldnt-fear-a-verizon-charter-merger.aspx?&amp;amp;utm_campaign=article&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_source=foxbusiness\" type=\"external\">potential acquisition target Opens a New Window.</a>, but I'd rather see Verizon snatch up Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH). With a market cap of less than $30 billion (compared to nearly $87 billion for Charter), Dish would be much less expensive and likely easier to integrate.

And with its stock trading at only about 12 times forward earnings -- a significant discount to the S&amp;amp;P 500's forward P/E of 18 -- investors can buy this dividend dynamo at a fantastic price today.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than Verizon CommunicationsWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While America cannot unilaterally determine the course of peace, security, freedom, and justice in the world, the role played by the world&#8217;s principal democratic power will have much to do with the course of history.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The Bicentennial of the Constitution, the instrument by which we have ordered our liberties so that they serve the common good, affords a unique angle of vision on America&#8217;s world responsibilities. In a 1963 reflection on Pope John XXIII&#8217;s great encyclical, Pacem in Terris, John Courtney Murray observed that the pope&#8217;s &#8216;. . . acute sense of the basic need of the age is evident in the word that is so often repeated in the encyclical and that sets its basic theme. I mean the word &#8220;order.&#8221; This does seem to be the contemporary issue. The process of ordering and organizing the world is at the moment going forward. The issue is not whether we shall have order in the world; the contemporary condition of chaos has become intolerable on a worldwide scale&#8230;. The question is, then, on what principles is the world going to be ordered?&#8217; As we read the daily papers, the truth of Pope John&#8217;s, and Murray&#8217;s, observation is made ever more clear, and usually in a tragic or threatening way.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The American people bring to this central world problem their own experience&#8212;imperfect, to be sure&#8212;of building community amidst plurality. We bring the experience, not merely the theory, of law and politics as nonviolent means of resolving conflict. We demonstrate in our national life that political community can be sustained and developed among peoples of every race and creed. We illustrate, in short, that the classic Catholic understanding of peace as &#8216;the tranquillity of order&#8217; (in St. Augustine&#8217;s famous phrase), today involves democratic political community. Americans instinctively know the truth of the teaching of John Paul II when he writes that &#8216;Respect for&#8230; human rights constitutes the fundamental condition for peace in the modem world: peace both within individual countries and societies and in international relations.&#8217;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I am not a specialist in foreign policy, nor is it the business of the Church to devise foreign policy for the United States. But it is the Church&#8217;s right and duty to insist that all political decisions, be they domestic or foreign in impact, have an irreducible moral component. Political reasoning is moral reasoning, according to the classic tradition of the West. And thus I suggest a moral focus for America&#8217;s action in the world: we must be a leader for ordered liberty, in and among nations. Where democrats struggle to replace tyrants of either the traditional or modem totalitarian stripe, there America&#8217;s support should be felt. Where nations work to resolve their differences through the democratic processes of negotiation, arbitration, law, and political persuasion, there America&#8217;s support should be felt as well. That support can be expressed through various means, and the calculus involved in the morality of means is complex indeed. But about ends we should be clear. One evidence that humanity is not meant for Hobbesian brutishness, for a &#8216;war of all against all,&#8217; is our own national experience. The American people have shown that conflict need not lead to mass violence, when democratic law and politics provide credible alternatives for resolving conflict. Here is one expression of what Pope John Paul II called for in his 1982 address at Hiroshima: a &#8216;major step forward in civilization and wisdom.&#8217; The Holy Father, preaching at Hiroshima, knew the full and terrible danger posed by nuclear weapons. But he also taught us that a transcendent hope, not secular survivalism, is the key to facing both the threat of nuclear war and the threat of totalitarian tyranny in a world striving to make the painful transition from anarchy to community. Peace and freedom, in the classic Catholic heritage and in the catechesis of John Paul II, go together.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;In its third century, then, let America bear witness for ordered liberty in the world. Here is where the American experience, American interests, and American purpose coincide. Here, too, is where, as the Second Vatican Council taught, the ministry of the laity in the world is exercised. As the Council fathers wrote, &#8216;On the national and international planes the field of the apostolate is vast; and it is there that the laity more than others are the channels of Christian wisdom.&#8217;&#8230; Let there be, then, vigorous and wise lay Catholic leadership in the inseparable causes of peace, freedom, and justice in and among nations.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Readers interested in the full text of &#8220;This Home of Freedom,&#8221; a document with implications ranging far beyond the Roman Catholic community, may obtain a copy by writing the Public Affairs Office of the Archdiocese of Denver at 200 Josephine Street, Denver, CO 80206.</p> \n\n<p>George Weigel is Distinguished Senior Fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C. and holds EPPC&#8217;s William E.

That's been the story for Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ: WFM) and Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT), both of which have had to deal with changing trends in their respective industry niches that have threatened their once-dominant business models. Whole Foods has faced increased competition in organic and natural foods as its competitive advantage has proven to be fragile, while Wal-Mart has had to deal with rising costs and online competition that have hampered its ability to offer the lowest prices possible. Value-oriented investors see opportunities in both stocks, but they want to know which one looks better right now. Below, we'll compare Whole Foods and Wal-Mart using a number of metrics designed to reveal which is the more attractive stock right now.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Neither Whole Foods nor Wal-Mart has produced huge returns recently, but Wal-Mart has done slightly better. The big-box department store has given investors a 9% total return since February 2016, compared to just 3% for the natural and organic grocer during the same period.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Wal-Mart.</p> \n\n<p>Yet even though Whole Foods hasn't done as well lately, investors still give it a much higher valuation than they give Wal-Mart. Looking at trailing earnings, Whole Foods stock trades at 22 times what the grocer has brought in on the bottom line over the past 12 months. Wal-Mart carries a lower trailing earnings multiple of just 15. Moreover, given the relatively downbeat expectations for future earnings growth from the two companies, looking at forward-earnings-based metrics doesn't change the picture much. Wal-Mart still has the lead with a forward multiple of 16 compared to Whole Foods' 23. On valuation, Wal-Mart ends up the winner.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Wal-Mart also has the more impressive record on the dividend front. In terms of current dividend yield, Wal-Mart has a lead of a full percentage point, weighing in at 2.8% compared to Whole Foods' 1.8%.</p> \n\n<p>Wal-Mart has demonstrated a greater commitment to dividends and payout growth over its long history. For 44 straight years, Wal-Mart has increased the annual amount it pays in dividends to its shareholders, with its most recent 2% boost coming earlier this month. The pace of Wal-Mart's dividend increases has slowed in recent years, but the payout has still almost doubled since 2009.</p> \n\n<p>By contrast, Whole Foods has been less reliable with its dividends. The company suspended payouts from mid-2008 to 2010, and increases have been relatively modest, including a $0.005 per share rise in January to $0.14 per share quarterly. Whole Foods simply hasn't been as clear as Wal-Mart has about its commitment to dividends and the importance they have to investors.</p> \n\n<p>Both Wal-Mart and Whole Foods have struggled, but both are trying to bounce back. In its most recent quarter, Wal-Mart managed to post sales growth of 1%, even though net income fell by more than a sixth from year-ago levels. Comparable sales in its U.S. stores climbed 1.8%, with traffic growth accounting for most of the rise, and Wal-Mart's efforts to boost its online presence paid off with a 29% jump in e-commerce sales domestically. The retailer's guidance for the coming year was conservative, with expected revenue growth of 2% to 3% and more or less flat earnings per share compared to the just-completed fiscal year. Yet as Wal-Mart keeps aiming on the online retail space and works at managing its extensive inventory more effectively, investors hope that the retail giant will find ways to use its size and experience to woo shoppers both to its stores and to its mobile app and online portal.</p> \n\n<p>Meanwhile, Whole Foods is still trying to figure out where the bottom of its recent downturn might be. In its most recent quarter, the grocer posted a 2% rise in revenue, but comparable-store sales dropped by 2.4% as traffic fell sharply. Whole Foods had to admit that it would see negative comps throughout the fiscal year, and it now thinks sales growth overall could be as little as 1.5%. The company is closing underperforming stores, and even though it's trying to refocus on its best customers, Whole Foods has conceded that it no longer believes that its store network will grow to the 1,200 mark that the company used to pursue. Early results from the 365 store concept, which features more attractive price points for certain shoppers, haven't proven to be the panacea that some investors had hoped to see. For investors, the future remains uncertain for Whole Foods, and more patience will be required to see where the store ends up.</p> \n\n<p>Wal-Mart looks like the better buy right now on all fronts. With a more attractive dividend, cheaper valuation, and clearer growth prospects, Wal-Mart should retain an edge over Whole Foods until the natural and organic specialist figures out how to bounce back from its huge setbacks recently.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than Wal-Mart StoresWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

His speech was one of several addresses and papers presented during the body's 59th annual meeting.</p> \n\n<p>Many ideas about Christianity that are most difficult to convey to a contemporary Western audience make intuitive sense to many indigenous African audiences, as well as some Asian audiences, Jenkins asserted.</p> \n\n<p>Cultures that espouse tribal identities and are intimately acquainted with animal sacrifice, dietary restrictions, polygamy, sacred rocks and the like are well-equipped to read and identify with the Hebrew Bible's stories, Jenkins said.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Teaching people (in the developing world) to obey the Bible if it means the Old Testament is not difficult,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In fact, for many of the new Christians in the world today the big problem is &#8230; telling people that the old law must be made subordinate, must be treated as inferior, to the new law.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In Africa, Jenkins continued, Western missionaries often must convince people the Old Testament is not the only or primary revelation of God's work. If Martin Luther hated it, he joked, it goes down great in Africa.</p> \n\n<p>In light of that cultural context, Jenkins said, the fundamental task of Christian believers should be to determine how much of the old religion has to be done away with in order to bring in the faith of Christ and to teach hearers to obey the things Jesus commanded.</p> \n\n<p>On the up side, Jenkins said, African and Asian tribes easily recognize and understand aspects of the traditional religion of the Old Testament as shaping what they should practice in light of the New Testament. And they often understand those aspects better than Christians in the Western world.</p> \n\n<p>The idea of atonement, for instance, is difficult to describe to someone who does not come from a culture that embraces animal sacrifice. But it is easy to talk of the sacrifice and atonement of Jesus with someone who understands sacrificial rituals as &#8220;a continuing reality,&#8221; he said.</p> \n\n<p>Most evangelicals never have seen an animal sacrifice or even a harvest, Jenkins said. &#8220;Now imagine that ideas like this are part of the fabric of your mind!&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Another aspect of the New Testament that connects easily with many indigenous African and Asian cultures, he added, involves Jesus' subversion of his society's class markers. Just as in Jesus' culture, one of the clearest markers of class is what&#8212;and with whom&#8212;wealthy or powerful people are allowed to eat.</p> \n\n<p>Jesus' inclination to share meals with low-caste people like prostitutes, or his tendency to touch or spend time with people that his society considered unclean, make him an even more striking figure in African and Asian cultures than in Western ones, Jenkins said.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Look at so many of the passages that we are used to in the West and that we don't even read any more and which are the most explosive,&#8221; Jenkins said.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Look at the passages which carry the most weight for women's groups reading the Bible in the global South. Think of the story of the woman with the issue of blood. Now imagine reading that story in a society that believes in blood contamination (and) that believes in blood impurity.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>After receiving the faith of Jesus, churches should &#8220;cauterize the culture&#8221; that has grown out of Christianity over the past two millennia and leave the core message, Jenkins concluded. But that is something, he said, the new Christian communities must do for themselves.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It is not for outsiders, for Westerners, to tell rising African and Asian churches what to do in this regard,&#8221; Jenkins said. &#8220;The best example of teaching to obey is by teaching to read&#8212;teaching to think and absorb and make relevant.&#8221;</p>", "title": "Need help understanding the Old Testament?

Suddenly, with all trains at a standstill, the railway system was under the control of the American Railroad Union, then led by Eugene V. Debs.</p> \n\n<p>President Cleveland conveniently invoked the executive responsibility to deliver mail to claim the strike was illegal and unjustified because the US Postal Service relied on train travel. He mustered a heavily armed force of more than 14,000 US Marshals, soldiers, and mercenaries to break the strike. After days of fighting and more than 30 workers killed, the strikers were dispersed and trains began to move.</p> \n\n<p>The Pullman Strike was one of the most catalyzing moments in American history, leading working people all over the country to draw revolutionary conclusions &#8212; including Debs, who read Marx for the first time while imprisoned for his role in organizing the strike.</p> \n\n<p>Cleveland was wary of the response to his actions. He signed Labor Day into law a mere six days after busting the strike.</p> \n\n<p>Convincing American workers to accept such a transparently disingenuous maneuver was a hard sell. But Cleveland found an effective ally in Samuel Gompers, the president of the American Federation of Labor (AFL), a conservative coalition of skilled workers that had opposed the strike.</p> \n\n<p>Gompers immediately endorsed the president&#8217;s holiday &#8212; Cleveland even presented him with the pen used to sign the holiday in law. Gompers later wrote a superlative column in the New York Times praising Labor Day as the harbinger of &#8220;a new epoch in the annals of human history.&#8221; He made the absurd claim that Labor Day &#8220;differs essentially from some of the other holidays of the year in that it glorifies no armed conflicts or battles of man&#8217;s prowess over man,&#8221; and wrote scathingly about the &#8220;dark side of the labor movement&#8221; represented by the Pullman strikers.</p> \n\n<p>Although previous Septembers had seen small workers celebrations in many states observing the end of summer, the first federally protected Labor Day was marked in 1894 with an AFL-supported parade.</p> \n\n<p>Debs still sat in jail with seventy-one others arrested during the Pullman action. Around the same time, the American Railway Union &#8212; previously the most powerful union in the country &#8212; was forcibly disbanded after the AFL denied its appeal.</p> \n\n<p>Labor Day marks our historic defeat, not our triumph.</p> \n\n<p>May Day celebrates the historic power of the working class to oppose its oppression and fundamentally alter society.

David Obey (D-WI) aimed at making it economically easier for low-income and vulnerable women to choose to carry pregnancies to term.</p> \n\n<p>I never thought the obvious needed to be stated, but apparently so. Rep. Obey&#8217;s measure would have, in all certainty, reduced the number of abortions in America by making it easier for women to carry their pregnancies to term. No matter what delusions Republicans seem to be laboring under, many women abort not because they&#8217;re frivolous people or don&#8217;t respect the &#8220;culture of life,&#8221; but because they respect it all too well, and understand that it&#8217;s cruel to bring a child into the world that can&#8217;t be provided for properly.

In late November, it was reported that the Saudis were purchasing $ 7 billion worth of precision arms from the US manufacturers, which is almost equal to the total worth of the British arms sales to the Saudi Arabia over the entire period of the Yemeni conflict. The purchase came as part of the mammoth $110-billion deal earlier brokered by the US President Donald Trump during his visit to Riyadh.</p> \n\n<p>Since 2015, the Sunni monarchy has been waging a war against Iran-backed Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen, which pushed one of the Arab world&#8217;s poorest countries to the brink of famine and left some 4,800 Yemenis killed, according to UN that says most of the civilian casualties were caused by Saudi-led coalition airstrikes, though Riyadh consistently denied the reports.</p> \n\n<p>According to the UN, some 20.7 million people in Yemen are currently in need of humanitarian assistance while a cholera outbreack, which is considered to be one of the worst in the world, affected more than 900,000 people there. At the same time, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) also called the humanitarian situation in Yemen the &#8220;largest food-security emergency in the world.&#8221;</p>", "title": "EU resolution calls for arms embargo against Saudi Arabia, accuses it of war crimes", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://newsline.com/eu-resolution-calls-for-arms-embargo-against-saudi-arabia-accuses-it-of-war-crimes/", "published_at": "2017-12-01", "bias": 1}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Image source: Inteliquent.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Shares of Inteliquent Inc.

Recently, though, railroad stocks have rebounded, and Union Pacific saw its stock climb above the $100-per-share mark last month for the first time since mid-2015. Some investors automatically think that a company will consider a stock split when its share price climbs into triple digits, and so it's natural to wonder whether Union Pacific will be splitting its stock soon. Below, we'll look more closely at Union Pacific's stock split history to try to get some hints about whether another split is likely to come.</p> \n\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \n\n<p>Union Pacific has done several stock splits during its history, as you can see below:</p> \n\n<p>Data source: Union Pacific investor relations.</p> \n\n<p>Ordinarily, stock splits before the 1970s are hard to analyze, because price information is hard to retrieve. In Union Pacific's case, however, the company actually provides its own pricing data, and that is helpful in assessing what motivated the railroad company to do stock splits.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Union Pacific has changed the way it assesses stock splits throughout its history. Early on, the company allowed its stock price to climb well above levels that prompted many of its peers in the stock market to do stock splits. In 1948, the stock price was $190 per share before the stock split took effect, and the 1956 split occurred with the share price at about $172.50. The big 5-for-1 split in 1956 gave Union Pacific plenty of room for growth without needing to consider further splits for a couple of decades.</p> \n\n<p>Image source: Union Pacific.</p> \n\n<p>By the 1970s, however, Union Pacific had adopted a more conventional approach to stock splits. The 1977 move happened with the stock at $97 per share, preventing the company's shares from reaching sustained triple-digit levels. The railroad was even faster on the draw in 1980, splitting with the stock at around $75 per share, and the 1991 split involved shares at prices between $94 and $95. Based on that part of its history, it would be natural to think Union Pacific might consider a split now.</p> \n\n<p>However, within the last decade, Union Pacific has reverted to its former strategy of allowing its stock to climb well past the $100-per-share mark before doing splits. In May 2008, Union Pacific traded at almost $160 at its high, and it had been above $100 per share throughout 2007 and early 2008 before the railroad made its move. After that, the financial crisis hit, sending Union Pacific's stock down sharply and taking several years to recover.</p> \n\n<p>Yet by late 2011, Union Pacific was once again trading in triple digits. The railroad waited two-and-a-half years before splitting, letting the stock hit the $200 per share mark before doing the split.</p> \n\n<p>It therefore seems very unlikely that Union Pacific will split again in the near future. It's only because of the downturn in the railroad industry that the stock fell back below the $100 per share mark at all immediately follow the previous split. That indicates that the railroad is comfortable with a triple-digit share price, or else it would have chosen a different split ratio than 2-for-1.</p> \n\n<p>Given that Union Pacific did its last split just over two years ago, there's no reason for investors to think that the company will be in a hurry to do another one. It will likely take another 50% to 100% move higher for Union Pacific share prices from current levels to justify the next split for the railroad's stock.</p> \n\n<p>10 stocks we like better than Union Pacific When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Smaller companies, which cater toward U.S. domestic markets, are less exposed to a stronger U.S. dollar as rates rise, which would more negatively weigh on large-caps with a global footprint. Additionally, periods of rising rates also coincide with expanding economies, which often benefit smaller companies.</p> \n\n<p>The lower reliance on multinational sales has also supported mid-caps. Additionally, the mid-cap segment has provided favorable acquisition targets when cash-heavy large-cap companies are shopping around.</p> \n\n<p>Moreover, middle-capitalization stocks may offer a suitable middle ground between more volatile small-caps and less mobile large-caps. Mid-cap companies are slightly more diversified than their small-cap peers, which allows many of the companies to generate more consistent revenue and cash flow and provide more stable stock prices. Additionally, they are not so big that their size would slow down growth. Consequently, mid-caps have generated historically higher returns than large-caps, with higher volatility and higher beta, but at a lower ratio of return-to-risk than small-caps.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Among the best recent small-cap performers, the PowerShares Russell 2000 Equal Weight Portfolio (NYSE: <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.etftrends.com_etf-2Dresume.php-3Fquote-3Deqws&amp;amp;d=DQMFAg&amp;amp;c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&amp;amp;r=GRqff5l5MHpejHoKHot8Gp2SY_ZPxrunht950uhDnYCPYyIIU0YyzTG5vMXJEgC6&amp;amp;m=5SCG5s-hoQmDUcH1v_SdwLjILB-vT9ErXN_FsS9myoI&amp;amp;s=RSPbdrwkHUUrj2Pb9u5W5HJxMB0XxgACw5l-FzdZ9XI&amp;amp;e=\" type=\"external\">EQWS Opens a New Window.</a>) increased 3.6% and Schwab U.S. Small-Cap ETF (NYSE: <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.etftrends.com_etf-2Dresume.php-3Fquote-3Dscha&amp;amp;d=DQMFAg&amp;amp;c=cnx1hdOQtepEQkpermZGwQ&amp;amp;r=GRqff5l5MHpejHoKHot8Gp2SY_ZPxrunht950uhDnYCPYyIIU0YyzTG5vMXJEgC6&amp;amp;m=5SCG5s-hoQmDUcH1v_SdwLjILB-vT9ErXN_FsS9myoI&amp;amp;s=BmXott4iSl2ujCXdekmrBB3C532pxUm_B0RnTmqJ920&amp;amp;e=\" type=\"external\">SCHA Opens a New Window.</a>) rose 2.8%.</p> \n\n<p>EQWS takes an equal-weight position on the Russell 2000.

Today, he got some bad news. The head of Purple PAC, one of three super-PACs devoted to supporting his candidacy, told Politico that he was holding off on spending any more money for Paul&#8217;s election until the Kentucky senator&#8217;s campaign &#8220;corrects its problems.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Purple PAC was established by former Cato Institute head Ed Crane two years ago to generally support libertarian candidates. But after raising $1.2 million in the first half of this year, Crane <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2015/07/27/libertarian-donors-put-up-6-million-for-rand-paul-gop-bid\" type=\"external\">announced</a> the super-PAC was all in for Paul. The super-PAC&#8217;s website changed its motif and still features a heavily pro-Paul message. But on Tuesday, Crane <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/rand-paul-superpac-purplepac-dark-214221\" type=\"external\">told Politico</a> that as long as the campaign continues to languish in the polls without a more resonant message, he&#8217;s not going to spend or raise any money on Paul&#8217;s behalf.</p> \n\n<p>The libertarian views that catapulted Paul to national prominence had &#8220;disappeared,&#8221; Crane said, leaving many of Paul&#8217;s longtime backers miffed.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;I want to grab Rand by the lapels and say, &#8216;What are you doing?'&#8221; Crane said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan of Rand Paul. But whatever motivates his campaign, I don&#8217;t get it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In an email to Mother Jones, Crane said, &#8220;I still support Rand. We&#8217;ve stopped raising money until Rand starts emphasizing his libertarian positions, e.g., NSA, a more rational approach to Middle East, which we expect him to do.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Earlier this year, one Purple PAC contributor told Mother Jones that donors trusted Crane to make calls about supporting candidates, and it&#8217;s not clear how much of the decision to cease fundraising for Paul is driven by the donors. Crane&#8217;s outfit has relied heavily on one particular donor&#8212;Jeffrey Yass, the founder of investment firm Susquehenna International Group&#8212;who has also donated generously to the other pro-Paul super-PACs and is the largest single donor backing Paul&#8217;s candidacy. If Yass has soured on Paul, that raises questions about the candidate&#8217;s ability to continue in the race.</p> \n\n<p>Yass, who did not respond to a request for comment, donated $1 million of the nearly $1.2 million raised by Purple PAC this year. He also donated $1 million to America&#8217;s Liberty PAC, a super-PAC specifically endorsed by Paul. His contribution forms one-third of that PAC&#8217;s total fundraising haul. A third pro-Paul PAC, Concerned American Voters, has raised $1.8 million, of which Yass has kicked in $250,000. Combined, Yass has given more than $2.2 million, or roughly one-third of the total raised by pro-Paul super PACs.</p> \n\n<p>A Paul aide brushed off the news that Purple PAC was suspending its support for the Kentucky senator: &#8220;This PAC, as far as I can tell, has spent no money&#8212;zero&#8212;in support of Rand. For this and other reasons, this won&#8217;t impact Rand at all.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The only activity the PAC seems to have taken so far is promoting a contest <a href=\"http://purplepac.org/contest/\" type=\"external\">offering $10,000 in prizes</a> for the five best ideas on how to promote Paul. No winner has been announced.</p> \n\n<p>America&#8217;s Liberty PAC, the other major recipient of Yass&#8217; largesse, was run by two political operatives with close ties to the Paul family&#8217;s political operation, Paul&#8217;s nephew-in-law Jesse Benton and John Tate, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">both of whom have been indicted</a> on campaign finance charges stemming from their involvement with the Ron Paul campaign in the 2012 presidential race.

This subject has gained great prominence in public debate in the United States and elsewhere in recent years, abetted by the Piketty phenomenon and subsequently by Bernie Sanders&#8217;s focus on the issue in his electrifying (although doomed) presidential campaign challenge to the status quo.</p> \n\n<p>The success of Thomas Piketty&#8217;s Capital in the Twenty-First Century was surely due in part to one of the three related changes noted in Milanovic&#8217;s important new book: the stagnation of incomes among the middle classes of the developed world. The carefully collated data for the years 1988 to 2011 that form the evidence on which Global Inequality is based reveal that members of this group&#8212;not the richest 10 percent of the world population but the next tenth down&#8212;remain well off in global terms. But they have seen smaller (almost non-existent) income gains compared to any other group in the world, and they are described by Milanovic on Twitter as the &#8220;decile of discontent.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Milanovic notes two other momentous changes: the rise of a &#8220;global middle class,&#8221; most of them urban dwellers in China and other Asian countries, although with some in Latin America and Africa; and the emergence of a global plutocracy, the infamous 1 percent. Global Inequality argues that these trends have causes and consequences related to the interplay of economics and politics. In contrast to Piketty&#8217;s explanation&#8212;the famous technical expression r &amp;gt; g, which in plain English means a return to capital greater than the economic growth rate&#8212;Milanovic&#8217;s argument is a richer and more plausible account of changes in inequality as the outcome of political and social dynamics.</p> \n\n<p>This richness of analysis means Milanovic does not propose easy fixes for the disturbing degree of inequality, but neither does he see the present trends as inevitable. While observing that the twentieth century was the only time in history when inequality diminished as average incomes rose, he argues that political choices over taxation, education, and capital ownership could achieve the same again. The unspoken conclusion is that if politics does not distribute the gains of economic growth more fairly, the consequences could be dire.</p> \n\n<p>Milanovic argues that, within their own borders, countries follow cycles of the narrowing and widening of income distribution. He has a term for this dynamic: &#8220;Kuznets waves,&#8221; named after the pioneer of this kind of analysis, the American economist Simon Kuznets. In his work in the 1950s, Kuznets suggested that distribution followed a hump-shaped pattern: Inequality increased as countries moved from poor to middle income, reflecting the early success stories of economic development, and decreased as they progressed to developed status, when progressive taxation started to fund education and social transfers for the masses. This was an empirically robust observation until the late 1980s, when inequality started increasing once again in rich countries like the United States.</p> \n\n<p>Milanovic&#8217;s new Kuznets waves incorporate the same drivers of change in inequality, but he distinguishes between stagnant and growing economies, giving several historical examples. In stagnant economies&#8212;say, Europe before the Industrial Revolution or some poor countries now&#8212;inequality cycles up and down depending on the mortality of the population (and hence size of the labor force) and events such as wars or the discovery of resources. On average, life remains miserable.On the other hand, in economies that escape the poverty trap and have rising average incomes, higher inequality is made possible simply because there is more headroom, so incomes at the top can grow over time without causing starvation at the bottom. This occurred in economies like the United States and the UK in the nineteenth century and is occurring again today. New technologies reward small groups of skilled workers, reinforced by pro-rich policies enacted by governments, as those who benefit learn to leverage their economic power into political action.</p> \n\n<p>But in the historical examples, two mechanisms have kicked in, tending to reduce inequality within growing economies. One is the original, &#8220;benign&#8221; Kuznets mechanism of tax-funded provision of public goods and redistribution, education that increases the supply of relevant skills, and political participation. Another is Piketty&#8217;s &#8220;malign&#8221; mechanism of war, which reduces inequality; it levels down by destroying property, harming more those who have the most assets to lose (he was referring only to the big European wars). In contrast to Piketty, Milanovic sees war as a potential consequence of great inequality, as part of the dynamic rather than an external lightning bolt. &#8220;Rising inequality indeed sets in motion forces, often of a destructive nature, that ultimately lead to its decrease but in the process destroy much else,&#8221; he writes. &#8220;A very high inequality eventually becomes unsustainable, but it does not go down by itself; rather, it generates processes, like wars or social revolutions, that lower it.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>What does the Kuznets wave mechanism imply for the present? After setting out the recent changes in the global inequality data, the book considers in turn the trends in inequality both within and between countries.</p> \n\n<p>Prior to 1988 there had been a significant reversal in the determinants of an individual&#8217;s position in the global income distribution. In the early nineteenth century, this ranking depended on class: 80 percent of global inequality was explained by differences between rich and poor within countries. By the mid-twentieth century, 80 percent of the global income gap depended on income differences between countries. Milanovic attributes this switch to colonialism: Exploitation enabled the wages of workers in colonial powers to rise. The &#8220;country premium&#8221; on incomes probably peaked around 1970.</p> \n\n<p>Yet class has been returning as an explanatory factor. Thanks to the catch-up by some Asian economies, especially China, inequality between countries has narrowed, while inequality within countries has widened since 1988.</p> \n\n<p>Still, he writes: &#8220;The world where location has the most influence on one&#8217;s lifetime income is still the world we live in.&#8221; And the premium is huge. Compared to the poorest country, Congo, the premium for being American is 9,200 percent, for Brazilians 1,300 percent, and even for Yemenis it&#8217;s 300 percent. The premium for a good location is also greater the lower you go down the income distribution, so one of the poorest American citizens is even more than 9,200 percent better off than the poorest Congolese.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>No wonder international migration seems to be heading inexorably upward. The book considers the implications of migration at some length, noting, &#8220;The pent-up demand for migration is many times the actual rate.&#8221; Milanovic cites estimates that perhaps 10 percent of the world&#8217;s population would like to migrate to another country, compared to the 3 percent of the world&#8217;s population who have already migrated to date. He suggests that, as there is little chance of reducing the flow, rich recipient countries need to manage the consequences for their own citizens and budgets, for example by adopting discriminatory policies such as guest worker programs or reduced legal protections for immigrants.</p> \n\n<p>The final chapters turn to the future of global inequality and some reflections on policy. Milanovic argues that even if emerging economies like China and Brazil see slower growth, they will continue to grow faster than the old West, and so their income catch-up will remain one of the contributors to global distributional trends. The overall global pattern will largely depend on what happens to inequality within the two biggest countries, China and the United States. Here, he is more cautious about forecasting. The original Kuznets pattern of wider access to education and opportunity would tend to reduce inequality within China, and on balance he suggests this will outweigh any effects of corruption or internal conflict and break-up.</p> \n\n<p>On the other hand, he portrays America as trapped in a &#8220;perfect storm&#8221; of rising inequality. Technological change and investment in automation will continue to increase the share of income going to owners of capital. The same people are likely to be also those most able to earn very high incomes. There is a pattern of the high-earning marrying the fellow high-earning, so inequality is further embedded between households. And&#8212;above all&#8212;the rich are continually reinforcing their political power and dismantling pro-poor policies such as progressive taxation and funding for public education and infrastructure. &#8220;It is hard to see where any forces might come from that could counter rising income inequality in the United States,&#8221; he concludes.</p> \n\n<p>And the book concludes with a yet more pessimistic turn. Milanovic argues that capitalism (an economy based on the profit motive and privately owned capital) will survive, but democracy might not. Democracy is being hollowed out along with the middle class. Populism is the political vehicle for this process, the function of the &#8220;culture war&#8221; being to &#8220;mask the real shift of economic power toward the rich.&#8221; There is a section in the final chapter titled, &#8220;How can inequality in rich welfare states be reduced?,&#8221; but it covers just six pages; Milanovic&#8217;s heart is not really in providing a list of practical measures to reduce inequality and save democracy. Indeed, he quotes Machiavelli&#8217;s Discourses on Livy at the start of the chapter:</p> \n\n<p>If you tender your advice with modesty and the opposition prevents its adoption and, owing to someone else&#8217;s advice being adopted, disaster follows, you will acquire very great glory. And although you cannot rejoice in the glory that comes from disaster which befalls your city or your prince, it at any rate counts for something.</p> \n\n<p>It is clear he is inclined to predict disaster, suspecting the world is in for the malign mechanisms redressing inequality to kick in. &#8220;The short twentieth century is the only sustained period in history when rising mean incomes have been accompanied by decreasing income inequality,&#8221; he writes. That does not augur too well for the twenty-first century, given that it took the cataclysms of the Great Depression and World War II to create the conditions for post-war redistributive policies. At present there is little evidence of a political consensus for pro-equality policies, for all the surprising success of populists like Bernie Sanders.</p> \n\n<p>But there is a paradox in Milanovic&#8217;s pessimism, for he is arguing that in countries such as the United States and the U.K., the benign forces that reduce inequality are in reverse to such an extent that the malign political reaction of violent conflict might kick in; yet he also asserts that the Asian countries will continue their catch-up, so global inequality will continue its historic reduction. Good news is bad news. To pile on the paradox, the economic globalization that has enabled Asia&#8217;s rise is also driving migration to such a scale that it threatens to push the United States and Europe in a more xenophobic direction.</p> \n\n<p>The pessimism is tempting. Even though data for the United States and the U.K. suggest inequality of incomes in these two countries narrowed a bit after the financial crisis, the populism on the march on both sides of the Atlantic is certainly fed by rage against the elites. Great wealth looks like it has bought politics.</p> \n\n<p>There are two significant caveats to Milanovic&#8217;s argument about the near-inexorable forces driving inequality upward.</p> \n\n<p>One is the extent to which the malign trends are specifically American. Inequality certainly rose in most OECD countries after 1988, and it rose fastest in some of the more equal societies, such as Sweden. The forces of technology and globalization are global. However, politics is local. There are important differences among countries in their policy responses to inequality, and there will probably be different consequences. Some have fought harder than others to offset the divergence in market incomes with redistributive taxes and public spending or higher minimum wages.</p> \n\n<p>Indeed, taking the global income distribution as a whole, most of the people in the decile of discontent, the 10 percent of the world population whose incomes have not risen for the past 20 years, are from the bottom half of the income distribution in the United States, Germany, and to some extent Japan. Because America is so large, most of these individuals are Americans. And fully half the people in the global top 1 percent are American (with most of the rest from Western Europe, Japan, and Australasia&#8212;not the Russian and Chinese plutocrats who so easily leap to mind).</p> \n\n<p>Milanovic&#8217;s pessimism about the absence of any political correctives to inequality refers almost entirely to the United States. We Western Europeans have had a populist backlash too, but there are some signs that politicians are responding. The tough EU limits on bankers&#8217; bonuses, a large increase in the U.K. minimum wage, and the cooperation of most European nations on limiting the ability of multinationals to dodge taxes and generally behave like buccaneers rather than corporate citizens all count as evidence for this. It might be too little, too late, and the EU often seems to be in self-destruct mode in the face of slow growth and mass immigration, but there is something running counter to the malign mechanism of Milanovic&#8217;s Kuznets wave.</p> \n\n<p>The other caveat is that there may also be corrective economic forces to limit and ultimately reverse high income inequality. As Milanovic details, technological innovations are one of the drivers of growing inequality. Economists such as David Autor and co-authors Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz largely agree on the importance of digital technologies in raising the wage premium for the highly educated, in increasing the demand for low-skilled workers doing jobs the machines cannot, and in reducing employment and earnings in the kinds of routine jobs in the middle of the income distribution. The workers who held these jobs prior to the 1990s are the members of the decile of discontent.</p> \n\n<p>Millions of people have been automated out of their jobs many times in the past, and their prospects are always grim. No government has found a good way to help people who are technologically redundant. On the contrary, unemployment and poverty become embedded in formerly prosperous places such as America&#8217;s Rust Belt or Britain&#8217;s northern towns and cities. Yet other jobs are created, and ultimately well-paying ones too. The mechanism is the provision of education and training to replace redundant skills&#8212;made obsolete by machines&#8212;with new skills that complement the machinery. This takes a long time&#8212;a generation probably.</p> \n\n<p>But as a recent book, James Bessen&#8217;s Learning by Doing: The Real Connection Between Innovation, Wages, and Wealth, spells out in detail, this process has happened time and again with new technologies. He begins with the example of cotton in the Industrial Revolution. Skilled engineers who could install and maintain the new looms and spinning machines earned a high wage premium while the masses were immiserated. But over time the skills needed to work with the machinery were standardized and widely learned, along with time keeping and other disciplines of industrial work. Wages for the many then climbed. The same pattern has been observed with subsequent technological waves, and there is no reason not to expect it in the digital era.</p> \n\n<p>A generation is a long time to wait, and perhaps too long to avert the malign political reaction to inequality. So I wish Milanovic were not so halfhearted about faster policy responses. He advocates wider access to good education, and also wider ownership of financial assets, but he oozes doubt about whether these are politically feasible (who will campaign for higher inheritance taxes?) or if they would make much difference. There are other possibilities, though. Anthony Atkinson&#8217;s recent book, Inequality: What Can Be Done?, has a long list of suggestions&#8212;15, in fact, though they are specifically for the UK&#8212; and a discussion of their practicality. The ideas include stronger enforcement of anti-trust policy to reduce monopoly power&#8212;and earnings&#8212;in key sectors like finance; an increase in the minimum wage (already announced by the Conservative Chancellor George Osborne); a lifetime tax on capital receipts; and more progressivity in income tax.</p> \n\n<p>While any of these might seem impossible in the American political context, they are feasible-to-likely in Europe. Indeed, dysfunctional American politics pose the biggest hurdle across the Atlantic too, as some steps&#8212;for example, on multinational taxation or financial regulation and reward&#8212;require international agreement.</p> \n\n<p>I have no wish to be a Pollyanna about future political and economic prospects. Milanovic is surely right to point to the unsustainability of income inequality at current levels, and&#8212;as the unsustainable is never sustained&#8212;to worry therefore about what mechanisms will reduce it in the next Kuznets wave.</p> \n\n<p>The continuing, albeit slower, growth of China and other Asian countries means the West will continue in relative decline, the United States seemingly eager to be in the vanguard. Our middle class &#8220;decile of discontent&#8221; is paying the costs of adjusting to an economic structure based on the spread of digital technologies and automation. We should be thinking hard about how to assist the people affected (with citizen incomes, retraining, or guaranteed public jobs), about educating the next generation appropriately, and about ensuring the plutocrats are not allowed to float in their own sphere, utterly separate from their fellow citizens.</p> \n\n<p>As Milanovic concludes, &#8220;The gains from globalization will not be evenly distributed.&#8221; Nor will incomes stay so unequally distributed; but how exactly the reversal happens is up to all of us to determine.</p>", "title": "Everyone\u2019s Problem", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://democracyjournal.org/magazine/41/everyones-problem/", "published_at": "2016-06-20", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>&#8220;Political adviser Karl Rove and other high-ranking figures in the Bush White House played a greater role than previously understood in the firing of federal prosecutors almost three years ago, according to newly obtained e-mails that shed light on a scandal that led to mass Justice Department resignations and an ongoing criminal probe,&#8221; reports the Washington Post.</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://politicalwire.com\" type=\"external\">[via Political Wire]</a></p> \n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/30/AR2009073002023.html?hpid=topnews\" type=\"external\">Link</a></p> \n\n<p />", "title": "New Light on Rove's Role in U.S. Attorney Scandal", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://truthdig.com/articles/new-light-on-roves-role-in-u-s-attorney-scandal/", "published_at": "2009-07-31", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p /> \n\n<p>Soldiers from Battery A, 1st Battalion, 82nd Field Artillery Regiment fired the howitzers on their M109A6 Paladins during the first-ever firing of the Modular Artillery Charge System in the combat zone by an entire Paladin battery March 13, 2011 on Camp Taji, Iraq.

Fuzzy math aside, what his foes fail to mention is that the stimulus, like all else these days, operated under the conservative creed that everything must be done through the private sector. This ethos, which Obama has <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2011/06/11/Obama-Private-sector-key-to-jobs-growth/UPI-37351307786400/\" type=\"external\">firmly embraced,</a> prevents the federal government from taking the far more efficient route of simply employing people, which might have created many more good jobs at the same cost.</p> \n\n<p>Had Obama had heeded FDR&#8217;s experience during the Great Depression, we could have put unemployed people to work rebuilding American infrastructure&#8212;bridges, tunnels, railroads, roads&#8212;not to mention restoring and shoring up wetlands and carrying out other environmental projects. That&#8217;s what <a href=\"http://unsilentgeneration.com/2010/01/27/2630/\" type=\"external\">Roosevelt&amp;#160;famously did</a>with his Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation&amp;#160;Corps.</p> \n\n<p>Such an initiative might have been possible, on some scale, prior to the midterm elections. But with the gridlock in Congress and diminishing confidence in the president and government, that course now is hard to imagine. Instead, the austerity imposed by the <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">debt deal</a> will further impede any chance of real job growth&#8212;as <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2011-08-04/news/29850997_1_government-spending-job-growth-jobs-crisis\" type=\"external\">Roosevelt discovered</a> in 1937 when he briefly adopted austerity measures, only to see a falling unemployment rate spike once again.</p> \n\n<p>But even at this dismal stage, there remain a handful of realistic projects that ought to appeal to some fiscally minded conservatives, and Democrats as well.</p> \n\n<p>Jonathan Alter, a journalist and historian of FDR&#8217;s New Deal, is <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-07-22/a-smart-jobs-creation-idea-both-parties-can-love-jonathan-alter.html\" type=\"external\">promoting an idea</a> that would allow states to &#8220;convert their unemployment insurance payments from checks sent to the jobless into vouchers that can be used by companies to hire workers.&#8221; The amount of the checks would in effect become subsidies to the employers, so that &#8220;for instance, a position paying $40,000 might cost employers only $20,000, thereby encouraging them to hire&#8230;If a mere 10 percent of unemployed Americans persuaded employers to accept such vouchers, more than a million people would find work with no new spending beyond some administrative costs.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Alter thinks this plan, first suggested by Alan Khazei, a Democratic candidate for the Senate in Massachusetts, might appeal to &#8220;a Republican House that loves the concept of vouchers.&#8221; But so far there&#8217;s been no interest from Congress or the Obama administration.</p> \n\n<p>Another option is the already much-discussed German experience with short work weeks. As Kevin A. Hassett of the American Enterprise Institute <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/article/101282\" type=\"external\">explained this scheme</a> back in 2009:</p> \n\n<p>Firms that face a temporary decrease in demand avoid shedding employees by cutting hours instead. If hours and wages are reduced by 10 percent or more, the government pays workers 60 percent of their lost salary. This encourages firms to use across-the-board reductions of hours instead of layoffs. Here&#8217;s how the program works.</p> \n\n<p>A firm facing the challenges of the recession cuts Angela&#8217;s hours from 35 to 25 per week, thus reducing her weekly salary to 714 euros from 1,000 euros. Angela does not work for the firm during those hours. As part of its short-work program, the government now pays Angela 171 euros&#8212;60 percent of her lost salary. Most important, she still has a job. Effectively, the government is giving her unemployment insurance for the 10 hours a week that she is not employed.</p> \n\n<p>Sen. Jack Reed (D-RI) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) have put this program into legislation that so far has gone nowhere, with only a handful of cosponsors. This despite the fact, per <a href=\"http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/work-sharing-the-quick-route-back-to-full-employment\" type=\"external\">Dean Baker</a> of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, that &#8220;21 states (including California and New York) already have short-time compensation as an option under their unemployment insurance system. In these states, a governmental structure already exists to support work sharing, although there would have to be changes to make the system more user friendly so as to increase take-up rates.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>In the Washington Post last week, Steven Pearlstein <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/steven-pearlstein-the-global-economy-comes-to-the-end-of-its-string/2011/08/04/gIQAa2zEvI_story.html\" type=\"external\">pointed to another way</a> of immediately putting people to work, which harkens back to the idea of rebuilding the nation&#8217;s crumbling infrastructure:</p> \n\n<p>Over the next decade, the federal government is slated to spend hundreds of billions of dollars building roads, schools, airports, trolley lines and airport terminals, modernizing the air traffic control system, replacing computer systems and buying planes, ships, tanks, trucks and cars. Moving up some of that spending from years 8, 9 and 10 to years 1, 2 and 3 won&#8217;t cost any more in the long run, or increase the long-term deficit any more, but could sure help put a floor under the economy in the short run. For those worried about pork, the actual spending decisions could be left to an independent Infrastructure Bank.</p> \n\n<p>To spur private investment in equipment and research, the government could immediately allow companies of all sizes to deduct 100 percent of such expenses made in the next three years, rather than &#8220;depreciating&#8221; them over many years. That incentive to invest now will increase the deficit in the short run but have little or no impact on the long-term deficit.</p> \n\n<p>As former MoJo reporter <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/how-can-washington-help-create-jobs/2011/08/03/gIQAz7JTsI_blog.html\" type=\"external\">Suzy Khimm writes</a> in the Post, &#8220;The question of infrastructure funding will come up as soon as Congress returns from its August recess,&#8221; since &#8220;a bill reauthorizing spending on surface transportation&#8212;which would help build roads, highways, and the like&#8212;is set to expire in September. There&#8217;s a big gap between the House GOP proposal, which would slash federal spending to 35 percent less than Fiscal 2009 levels, and Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer&#8217;s two-year plan to spend $55 billion a year. Boxer&#8217;s proposal would require revenue beyond what&#8217;s in the Highway Trust Fund, which receives money from the gas tax, promising yet another fight over which will be better for the economy&#8212;reducing the deficit or Keynesian spending on infrastructure.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>We all know how that fight is likely to turn out. And as Alter notes, even these modest approaches to job creation call for an attitude of what Roosevelt called &#8220;bold, persistent experimentation&#8221;&#8212;and the leadership to back it up. And as we&#8217;ve seen all too clearly, Obama is no FDR.</p> \n\n<p />", "title": "Brother, Can You Spare a Job?", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "https://motherjones.com/politics/2011/08/obama-boehner-debt-jobs/", "published_at": "2011-08-09", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........</p> \n\n<p>Three descansos were relocated to the northeast corner of the frontage road of I-25 and San Antonio, to make way for the Paseo del Norte/I-25 reconstruction.

New Mexico has thousands of them, not just because our roads are so deadly &#8211; because they can be, given their rural nature and our continued battle with drunken driving &#8211; but because here, unlike in many states, descansos are held as sacred, traditional.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;New Mexico celebrates its markers,&#8221; according to the website RoadsideAmerica.com. &#8220;And local newspapers report when a new one goes up.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Which is not to say they are permitted. They&#8217;re not. But state agencies and contractors tend to look the other way when possible out of deference for the dead.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;We respect them,&#8221; said Phil Gallegos, spokesman for the state Department of Transportation. &#8220;We leave them alone as much as we can as long as they are not safety hazards.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>At the northwest embankment of the San Antonio exit off northbound Interstate 25 in Albuquerque, three crosses have stood sentinel for years. One of them was placed there shortly after a June 12, 2001, crash that killed Eddie Naranjo, a 30-year-old photo technician at the Journal who went out on his evening meal break and never came back.</p> \n\n<p>Another one &#8211; a white wooden cross with a Harley-Davidson sticker and a spray of white fabric roses at the base &#8211; honors Danny O&#8217;Daniel, who was 59 when he met his fate Nov. 11, 2011, at the San Antonio exit.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell whom the third descansos commemorates. There are no names or dates visible. It&#8217;s made of thick, industrial metal chain welded in the shape of a cross, tipped in orange paint, adorned with black crepe and flowers and accompanied by solar lights.</p> \n\n<p>On occasion, flowers are refreshed. This time of year, luminarias appear.</p> \n\n<p>This embankment along I-25 and San Antonio, the former location of three descansos, has been excavated for the Paseo del Norte/I-25 reconstruction. (Dean Hanson/Albuquerque Journal)</p> \n\n<p>But sometime after construction began in October on the nearby Paseo del Norte interchange, the descansos disappeared, the sandy embankment of ragged sage and residual weed groomed and graded over, wiped clean of any vegetation or structure.</p> \n\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \n\n<p>As part of the $93 million overhaul of the I-25 corridor, the bridge above San Antonio will be widened and the northbound freeway entrance ramp &#8211; which abuts the northwest embankment &#8211; will be eliminated. The grading of the embankment is part of the process of closing off the entrance.</p> \n\n<p>But soon after the descansos disappeared, they re-emerged on the northeast embankment, below a Denny&#8217;s parking lot, mirror images of what they had looked like across the frontage road.</p> \n\n<p>It&#8217;s not entirely clear who moved the crosses, who took such care and reverence to reposition these reminders of lives lost, but the Department of Transportation&#8217;s Gallegos said the contractor &#8211; in this case, Kiewit New Mexico &#8211; is responsible for removing and replacing items found in the construction zone.</p> \n\n<p>Calls left with Kiewit were not returned.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty common procedure,&#8221; Gallegos said.</p> \n\n<p>He recalled a project that required grading in the medians where several descansos were situated. The contractor placed concrete barriers around them as protection from the tractors.</p> \n\n<p>During major construction work on U.S. 550 &#8211; peppered with numerous descansos northwest from Bernalillo &#8211; contractor E.L. Yeager surveyed, removed, boxed up every cross, flower and teddy bear and replaced them once construction was completed.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;They do go to certain lengths to keep things as is,&#8221; Gallegos said.</p> \n\n<p>The custom of marking the spot where someone died is deeply rooted in our Southwestern culture. The term descansos roughly translates to &#8220;resting place&#8221; and refers to those days when coffins were transported by horse and cart or the strength of several men to a final destination. When the caravan paused along their journey, they erected markers made of stacked stones.</p> \n\n<p>They are part of who we are, part of who they were. They are reminders that our journeys here on the road of life do not go on forever.</p> \n\n<p>Thanks to conscientious road crews and contractors, these markers just may.</p> \n\n<p>UpFront is a daily front-page news and opinion column.

And the corporate media&#8217;s coverage of it may only make it worse.</p> \n\n<p>For example, in one of his first public appearances, on CNBC&#8217;s morning show (Squawk Box, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/09/epa-chief-scott-pruitt.html\" type=\"external\">3/9/17</a>), Pruitt set an ominous precedent for the Trump administration&#8217;s climate change policy by outright lying. In response to host Joe Kernan&#8217;s question about the role of human-generated carbon dioxide in warming the planet, Pruitt responded:</p> \n\n<p>I think that measuring with precision human activity on the climate is something very challenging to do and there&#8217;s tremendous disagreement about the degree of impact, so no, I would not agree that it&#8217;s a primary contributor to the global warming that we see.</p> \n\n<p>Pruitt added: &#8220;We need to continue the debate and continue the review and the analysis.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Pruitt&#8217;s comments are, by now, recognized as among the standard rhetorical tools of climate deniers (Guardian, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2013/sep/16/climate-change-contrarians-5-stages-denial\" type=\"external\">9/15/13</a>). He boldly mischaracterizes as &#8220;tremendous disagreement&#8221; what is, in fact, an <a href=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/\" type=\"external\">overwhelming scientific consensus</a> about the link between humanity&#8217;s greenhouse gases and global warming. Then he disingenuously calls for more &#8220;debate&#8221; and &#8220;analysis&#8221; of the topic, while at the same time the Trump administration is proposing <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trump-administration-seeks-big-budget-cuts-for-climate-research/\" type=\"external\">massive budget cuts</a> of the federal agencies that would conduct this research and analysis.</p> \n\n<p>That this White House would embrace climate change denial, of course, comes as no surprise. The current president has a well-documented history of promoting right-wing conspiracy theories about climate change, calling it on numerous occasions an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/408983789830815744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" type=\"external\">&#8220;expensive hoax&#8221;</a> that was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/265895292191248385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" type=\"external\">&#8220;created by the Chinese.&#8221;</a> During the 2016 campaign, Trump told a right-wing radio host, <a href=\"http://www.hughhewitt.com/donald-trump-returns/\" type=\"external\">&#8220;I&#8217;m not a big believer in man-made climate change,&#8221;</a> promising to abandon the landmark Paris Agreement on climate action President Obama signed in 2016. During the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlI5l41Hpww\" type=\"external\">first presidential debate</a>, Trump did deny having ever called climate change a hoax, but the public record obviously proves otherwise.</p> \n\n<p>Pruitt, a dogged opponent of the EPA while Oklahoma attorney general, is cut from the same climate denial cloth, minus the outrageous tweets. A trove of 6,000 emails released via court order by an Oklahoma judge last month (New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/us/politics/scott-pruitt-environmental-protection-agency.html\" type=\"external\">2/22/17</a>) revealed that Pruitt had colluded for years with oil and gas companies, as well as the Koch brothers&#8217; political arm, to lobby against EPA greenhouse gas regulations. He even &amp;#160;secretly used drafts of oil company talking points in his correspondence to the federal government.</p> \n\n<p>Nevertheless, the selection in December of a hard-right climate denier like Pruitt to run the agency <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reedfrich/status/806620055140270081\" type=\"external\">upset a phony media narrative</a> that had begun just a few weeks after the election. Thanks to a few <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/us/politics/donald-trump-visit.html\" type=\"external\">casual comments</a> by Trump to the Times editorial staff in November, much of the pundit class had convinced itself that the new president was pivoting to a more moderate position. The prospect of four more years of this same media credulity and deference to power does not bode well for future climate change coverage.</p> \n\n<p>CNBC&#8217;s Kernan, in his interview with Pruitt, provided a sneak preview of what this next four years of media obsequiousness may look like. Not satisfied with merely letting Pruitt lie unchallenged, Kernan felt compelled to back him up. &#8220;That&#8217;s the whole point of science, is to keep asking questions,&#8221; Kernan disingenuously added in his wrap-up. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be called a denier, it scares me. It&#8217;s a terrible thing. Administrator Pruitt, I know you don&#8217;t want to be called it either.&#8221; Before throwing the segment back to a studio host, Kernan didn&#8217;t give time for Pruitt to agree. Then again, why even bother?</p> \n\n<p>To be fair, CNBC is not a cable TV network known for its trenchant climate change reporting. And one can safely assume that Pruitt&#8217;s climate change denials on Fox News will be met with a &#8220;fair and balanced&#8221; tongue bath likely to put Kernan&#8217;s to shame. But subtle changes in so-called straight reporting and coverage matter too. That&#8217;s why the online story ( <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/09/epa-chief-scott-pruitt.html\" type=\"external\">3/9/17</a>) accompanying Kernan&#8217;s interview is a better, more ominous barometer of how the corporate media might respond to the Trump administration&#8217;s climate policy.</p> \n\n<p>Overall, the CNBC article, by energy reporter Tom DiChristopher, sanded off almost all of Kernan&#8217;s overt sycophancy. However, the story still trafficked in classic <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">false equivalence</a>. When comparing Pruitt&#8217;s evidence-free claims to the vast amount of climate data and overwhelming scientific consensus supporting anthropogenic climate change, CNBC notably chose to characterize the latter as merely &#8220;the opinion&#8221; of NASA and NOAA: &#8220;Pruitt&#8217;s view is also <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-data-show-2016-warmest-year-on-record-globally\" type=\"external\">at odds with the opinion</a> of NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Recent history offers numerous examples of the corporate media succumbing to the temptation of parroting White House talking points, no matter how disconnected from reality. Recall that, for years, major news organizations, including the New York Times, felt compelled to echo the <a href=\"http://harpers.org/blog/2009/05/the-timess-torture-hypocrisy/\" type=\"external\">Bush administration&#8217;s &#8220;enhanced interrogation&#8221; euphemisms</a> for what had previously been recognized as acts of torture (Extra!, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">5&#8211;6/08</a>). Now that climate denialism has become de facto US policy, it will become almost impossible for journalists to both maintain traditional &#8220; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">objectivity</a>&#8221; while also reporting scientific reality to the public. They have a clear choice to make.</p> \n\n<p>As the long indictment of flawed climate change coverage by Robert Eshelman (CJR, <a href=\"http://archives.cjr.org/essay/the_danger_of_fair_and_balance.php\" type=\"external\">5/1/14</a>) can attest, corporate media have not always chosen wisely. Time and again, it has demonstrated that it can be successfully gamed by denialists operating little more than a propaganda campaign. Asks Eshelman in his insightful essay:</p> \n\n<p>Journalists&#8230;wouldn&#8217;t have provided &#8220;balance&#8221; to a debate on gravity, giving equal time to someone asserting that it doesn&#8217;t exist; why would they for climate change?</p> \n\n<p>But now that climate change lies have the imprimatur of the president of the United States, we may find that scientific facts and the fundamental laws of physics are subject to even more media distortion.</p> \n\n<p>Reed Richardson is a media critic and writer whose work has appeared in The Nation, AlterNet, Harvard University&#8217;s Nieman Reports and the textbook Media Ethics (Current Controversies).

But the gathering was also seen as a test of Netanyahu&#8217;s popularity and control over his party. For now, Likud appears to be firmly behind its leader, and any internal opposition remains in check.</p> \n\n<p>Addressing the packed convention hall, Netanyahu accused the &#8220;leftist&#8221; media and political opposition of pushing for an indictment to topple him because they cannot defeat him at the ballot box. Some estimated the crowd numbered at least 2,000.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The left and the media, and they&#8217;re the same thing, you know, they are mustering an obsessive, unprecedented hunt against me and my family to carry out a regime change,&#8221; he said.</p> \n\n<p>Netanyahu also blamed the media for ousting two right-wing Israeli governments in the 1990s and held them responsible for the &#8220;disaster&#8221; of the Oslo Accords signed with the Palestinians in 1993, suicide bombings on public buses in the 1990s, and the second intifada in the early 2000s.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Their aim is to apply illegitimate and nonstop pressure on law enforcement so they file an indictment at any price, with no connection to the truth, with no connection to justice,&#8221; he said.</p> \n\n<p>The speech resorted to a familiar strategy to Netanyahu. During a three-decade political career, he has frequently attacked the media, political opposition, Israel&#8217;s Arab minority and the Palestinians in an attempt to rally Likud and portray himself as a victim.</p> \n\n<p>Former prime minister Ehud Barak, one of the targets of Netanyahu&#8217;s sniping, rebuffed Netanyahu&#8217;s comments saying &#8220;there&#8217;s no hunt, there&#8217;s corruption.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Yair Lapid, a former finance minister under Netanyahu who heads the Yesh Atid party, tweeted after the prime minister&#8217;s speech that it &#8220;crossed every line.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;What we saw this evening wasn&#8217;t a rally of support for Netanyahu but a rally in support of corruption,&#8221; Lapid said.</p> \n\n<p>Netanyahu made no mention of the police or prosecutors handling the investigation. But he warned the Palestinians against hoping for his political demise. Palestinian leaders &#8220;will be disappointed too, because it won&#8217;t happen,&#8221; he said.</p> \n\n<p>Likud leaders put heavy pressure on party activists to attend the rally. The gathering had a festive, at times raucous atmosphere, with activists hoisting Israeli flags, banners criticizing the media and chanting &#8220;Bibi, King of Israel,&#8221; using his nickname. One banner read, &#8220;enough with the putsch attempt&#8221; and a second decried the &#8220;fake news&#8221; with an English expletive.</p> \n\n<p>Netanyahu, the second-longest serving leader in Israeli history, is engulfed in a series of scandals relating to alleged financial misdeeds and supposed illicit ties to executives in media, international business and Hollywood.</p> \n\n<p>Israeli police investigators say they suspect Netanyahu of being involved in bribery, fraud and breach of trust in a pair of cases.</p> \n\n<p>Netanyahu&#8217;s former chief of staff and longtime confidant, Ari Harow, recently signed a settlement connected to a separate case in which he agreed to testify against his former mentor. This has raised speculation that Netanyahu could be indicted soon, and has sparked opposition calls for him to step down.</p> \n\n<p>Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and called the accusations a witch hunt.</p> \n\n<p>David Bitan, Likud&#8217;s parliamentary whip and a close Netanyahu ally, said some 1,500 people were signed up for Wednesday&#8217;s event and he hoped even more would attend &#8212; including all the party&#8217;s top officials and ministers.</p> \n\n<p>No one in the party has come out against Netanyahu yet &#8212; reflecting both loyalty and the fear of crossing him.</p> \n\n<p>Internal criticism has emerged only from those outside of politics. Limor Livnat, a former Likud Cabinet minister, has condemned the attacks on the police and prosecution and said that Netanyahu should step aside if indicted.</p> \n\n<p>Israel&#8217;s justice minister has said Netanyahu would not have to step down even if he is indicted. That means his short-term future will likely depend on whether he can maintain political and public backing.</p> \n\n<p>Avraham Diskin, a political scientist at Jerusalem&#8217;s Hebrew University, said there is no immediate threat and the goal of Wednesday&#8217;s rally was to quash any thoughts of trying to challenge him.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Netanyahu is tightening the bolts and exerting his authority,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The whole point it to scare any of the &#8216;pretenders&#8217; against getting ideas in their head. He&#8217;s conveying that he is still powerful and everyone should keep their knives holstered.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Netanyahu has escaped several scandals before, but the scope of the latest accusations appears to pose his stiffest challenge yet.</p> \n\n<p>One investigation involving Netanyahu, dubbed by police as &#8220;File 1000,&#8221; reportedly concerns claims he improperly accepted lavish gifts from wealthy supporters, including Australian billionaire James Packer and Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan.</p> \n\n<p>The second investigation, &#8220;File 2000,&#8221; reportedly concerns Netanyahu&#8217;s alleged attempts to strike a deal with publisher Arnon Mozes of the Yediot Ahronot newspaper group to promote legislation to weaken Yediot&#8217;s main competitor in exchange for more favorable coverage of Netanyahu by Yediot.</p> \n\n<p>A third investigation, &#8220;File 3000,&#8221; relates to a possible conflict of interests involving the purchase of German submarines, in which Netanyahu&#8217;s cousin and personal attorney represented the German firm involved in the deal.</p> \n\n<p>Netanyahu has dismissed the suspicions as &#8220;background noise&#8221; and vowed to push forward.</p>", "title": "Netanyahu Rips Media, Opposition in Face of Corruption Case", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://newsline.com/netanyahu-rips-media-opposition-in-face-of-corruption-case/", "published_at": "2017-08-09", "bias": 1}, {"text": "<p>Photo from <a href=\"http://www.laizquierdadiario.cl/Chile\" type=\"external\">La Izquierda Diario, Chile</a></p> \n\n<p>Marcelo Lepe Parraguez was training to become a \"transformista\" [roughly translates to drag queen] in the circus of San Bernardo. Some time ago, he told relatives that for months he was being harrassed by his neighbors.</p> \n\n<p>On February 17, Marcelo went out with his mother to buy groceries, when two female neighbors started to hurl insults at him for being gay. He was defended by his mother, who then began to receive blows by the two women. Marcelo, who was trying to defend himself was intercepted by two men who started to kick him on the ground. The mother and son started to retreat from the scene. Unfortunately, this horrible story doesn't end here. Marcelo Vega, partner of the victim, states that one of the female aggressors started to yell, \"?Kill the damn faggot, kill the bastard.\"?

This was the bullet that led to Marcelo's death.</p> \n\n<p>The Santiago district attorney's office has detained Juan Carlos Altamirana, but the other three accomplices remain free.

At fifty-eight years old and after having published in October her fourteenth book, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Fledgling</a>, Butler had many more thrilling tales of reason and self-consciousness in her and she was getting better and better at it. The loss of her knocked me down and, while writing these words in her memory, it&#8217;s been hard to get up again.</p> \n\n<p>In many ways, Fledgling was a new departure: a &#8220;vampire&#8221; book that had returned her to the supreme pleasures of storytelling. I was in the audience at a &#8220;lecture&#8221; she gave at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York in November, a few weeks after Fledgling&#8217;s release. There she admitted to everyone that writing Fledgling was fun, that she hadn&#8217;t experienced this kind of joy in writing a novel for a very long time. In her most recent interviews, she was calling the new novel &#8220;light,&#8221; yet this playful description was meant in direct comparison to her previous novels, which are utopian in the heaviest sense you can imagine.</p> \n\n<p>I put &#8220;lecture&#8221; in quotation marks because all Butler wanted to do that night in New York was have conversation with the members of her audience. She refused to lecture. In their questions, many of her readers proved to be just as perspicacious as their writer-hero up there on stage lounging comfortably, as if this particular spot was for Butler no different than being at home in her reading chair. I remember thinking that these questions from the audience substantiate well the claim that every artist deserves the audience they end up getting.</p> \n\n<p>This particular audience was simply brilliant, in a laid-back kind of way. It was a hard-earned cool, a self-ironic knowingness based on the fact that they have been reading, and rereading, books written not for the market or for a clique of like-minded people but rather for the genuine love of our abused humanity.</p> \n\n<p>The line at the end of the lecture to have Butler sign the books they had brought with them was endlessly long and was not moving. I had brought several of my favorites for her to sign ( <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Patternmaster</a>, Dawn, and the Parable series) as well as my entire English class, who at the time was reading and studying <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Parable of the Sower</a> and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Parable of the Talents</a>. But the line&#8217;s lack of progress deterred me from joining, so I went home. The next day, when I asked my students how long they had had to wait, many shot me disapproving glances. Had it been necessary, they would have waited all night long.</p> \n\n<p>It turns out the line didn&#8217;t move well because Butler insisted on answering every question asked of her, including an intriguing one posed by a student of mine. He related to me and his classmates that he had asked her when his turn came why she made Lauren&#8217;s &#8220;hyper-empathy syndrome&#8221;-one of the main plot devices of the Parable series-so ambiguous, that is, biological, psychological, and socio-economic at the same time? Butler had paused, set down her pen and explained patiently to him her rationale.</p> \n\n<p>From the beginning, Butler&#8217;s genius was impossible to deny and nobody undertook what would have taken strenuous effort the attempt to do it. In the early 1980s she won the Hugo and Nebula Awards, which are science fiction&#8217;s most coveted prizes, and in 1995 she won the MacArthur Foundation Genius Grant. But you could still not find an official Octavia E. Butler web site, because one did not exist, on purpose, and never would. And forget about catching her on C-Span&#8217;s Booknotes or on Charlie Rose. She was an unapologetic, self-declared hermit yet I had suspected, which was confirmed for me while in her presence last November in New York, that she had a good political reason for always staying on the down low. She deliberately avoided celebrity status because it requires an end to thought, and that&#8217;s all her books do-think.</p> \n\n<p>Writing about one&#8217;s favorite writer, especially when that writer has without any notice up and died on you, should be short and to the point, because this exercise can lead into a long, drawn-out self-therapy session. I could use to talk about what Octavia Butler has meant to me, how she saved me more than a few times from cynicism, and more importantly how she has constantly enlivened my classrooms for the last sixteen years. But that would be for me, not for her. To her, I&#8217;d like to say three simple things.</p> \n\n<p>Thank you for weathering the storm of American irrationalism. The degradation of thinking and writing over the last twenty years in this society is hardly believable. If visited by another solar species-a storyline you made famous in your Xenogenesis trilogy ( <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Dawn</a>, <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Adulthood Rites</a>, and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Imago</a>)-the conclusion they are compelled to draw is that the human species is unusually cute and often cuddly, and it continues to produce a lot of cute and cuddly art and literature, but its lethal and highly toxic fatal flaw has never been dealt with rationally, honestly, openly and systematically, and as a consequence we are now closer than ever to doing ourselves in, albeit in a really cute, cutting-edge, fashionable way.</p> \n\n<p>You called this fatal flaw our &#8220;hierarchical tendencies,&#8221; a pattern of species-specific behavior that is completely transparent to anyone who takes a moment to observe humans from outside their pre-programmed pro-corporate consciousness. How else can we keep missing it? All the genocidal wars of conquest and mass extermination, almost always for higher profit margins and therefore higher placement on the planet&#8217;s human-made, market-driven totem pole; the everyday assaults on each other&#8217;s vulnerable humanity; the unspeakable vengeance and spite. The frightening lack of historical consciousness and the idiotic denials of the root of the real chaos causing all the weak denials in the first place. The incessant and seemingly inexplicable exact repetitions of past blunders. A blind following of leaders who are absolutely not fit to rule, and the odd religious conservativeness in a species secular and often revolutionary in its actual possibilities; the familiar preference for easy comforts and solutions, for instant gratification over long-range planning, self-criticism, self-sacrifice, and rational experimentation with forethought and care.</p> \n\n<p>The second thing is that your books have encouraged the best feature of humanity, intellectual curiosity. Your books never close the door; instead they broaden current horizons and open up new ones. They make people want to go to the library and search out for themselves rational and scientific explanations for the opaque world in which we live. You have showed people that the thickness of reality can be penetrated through focused and persistent intellectual effort. You termed this type of mental labor a &#8220;positive obsession,&#8221; this trying to survive whole.</p> \n\n<p>The third thing is you have unsettled the minds of a lot of people who otherwise might have gone on thinking their shit don&#8217;t stink, people who think of themselves as morally-sound, broad-minded, liberal, and tolerant. You have in every book of yours flipped the script on them by showing they are very tolerant indeed, of racism and stupidity, illiteracy, hunger, preventable and treatable disease, the scapegoating, bullying, and persecution of the poor and the politically defenseless, legal theft and official lying, the wholesale deforestation of the planet and the capitalist single-minded pillaging of what remains of our earthly paradise, megalomania and self-seeking, and a lock-step obedience to irrational and discredited authority.</p> \n\n<p>In one of your last interviews, you put it tersely and profoundly as was your style. This style led many people to call you an oracle, a label that always made you chuckle. The interviewer had asked you if you&#8217;re pessimistic or optimistic about the future of the United States.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;At the present,&#8221; you answered, &#8220;I feel so unhopeful. I recognize we will pay more attention when we have different leadership. I&#8217;m not exactly sure where that leadership will come from. But that doesn&#8217;t mean I think we&#8217;re all going down the toilet, I just don&#8217;t see where that hope will come from. I think we need people with stronger ideals than John Kerry or Bill Clinton. I think we need people with more courage and vision. It&#8217;s a shame we have had people who are so damn weak.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Your own strengths as a writer and an intellectual, expressed always with a determined humility and without any fear of what those in power might say about it, will remain in all your novels. So we mourn not the loss of your words but of your future words and how they could have straightened out our thinking by focusing it on the root causes of all the purposefully fabricated and contrived confusions and controversies. It seems to me this is the whole lesson of your Parable books. Lauren created this new communist community you called Earthseed to save herself, but her great intention was for us readers to keep planting it deep in the ground of every place we live, work, and educate.</p> \n\n<p>JONATHAN SCOTT is Assistant Professor of English at the City University of New York, Borough of Manhattan Community College.

Red Pill men are aware that women are strongly influenced by the culture and that their attraction cues are often outside of their conscious awareness. Increasingly, modern women, and especially Western women, indulge in one-night stands and short-term relationship in their 20s with alpha males, followed by seeking out a beta male provider in their late 20s and early 30s. Red Pill men are aware of this phenomenon and develop a sexual strategy to benefit from a woman&#8217;s promiscuity as well as avoid the financial peril of marriage. Married men can also be Red Pill, as their awareness helps them handle female shit tests and maintain attraction with their partner.</p> \n\n<p>A man who has taken the Red Pill is committed to self-improvement and adapting to the reality of female behavior whether that be through the application of game in his relationships and/or withdrawing from LTRs.</p> \n\n<p>However, a wrench was thrown in their &#8220;game&#8221; when someone figured out their secret identities and <a href=\"https://jaredandjacobsaid.wordpress.com\" type=\"external\">exposed them on a blog</a>, enraging the both women mentioned on their posts and podcasts, and pretty much anyone else with an ounce of decency.</p> \n\n<p>Several businesses in the Asheville area have since cancelled their orders with Waking Life Espresso and pulled the product from the shelves.

Members of the community have rallied to protest outside the shop, with signs saying &#8220;We like our women like we like our coffee&#8211;not at Waking Life.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>One post on the &#8220;Holistic Game&#8221; blog (tagline: &#8220;Putting sweet D in the tender V since 2013&#8243;), titled &#8220; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20150514232038/https://holisticgame.wordpress.com/2015/03/19/a-breakdown-of-all-my-lays/\" type=\"external\">A Breakdown of All My Lays</a>,&#8221; details the 50 women Rutledge claims to have had sex with since learning &#8220;game&#8221;&#8211; how he met them, how the sex went, and, perhaps most pathetically, his personal views on their prospects for future relationships.</p> \n\n<p>After being exposed, both&amp;#160;Jared Rutledge and Jacob Owens wrote long-ass apologies for their behavior, with Jared primarily blaming his behavior on his Christian upbringing and &#8220;insecurities,&#8221; and Jacob primarily blaming Jared. <a href=\"http://ashevilleblog.com/waking-life-espresso-is-under-fire/\" type=\"external\">You can read those here</a>, if you are into that sort of thing.</p> \n\n<p>However, we here at The Frisky are more concerned with the women mentioned in the posts, and how they feel after being betrayed in this manner.</p> \n\n<p>I spoke to one of the women on the list, and this is what she had to say:</p> \n\n<p>I was mortified when I realized I was listed. Complete shock. At a loss for words. I am half surprised the list exists. During the time I dated him, there was no indication that he was a sociopath simply looking to get laid. He demonstrated genuine feelings, and was disappointed when I decided to end things because I felt he wasn&#8217;t done dating other girls and getting a feel for what was out there.</p> \n\n<p>On the other hand, he was over analytical and really got in his own head, so the syntax used specifically in the &#8220;Breakdown of My Lays&#8221; post articulates his thought process on dating accurately.The apology is a bunch of a crap. They&#8217;re sorry they got caught. There is no doubt in my mind (based on the Tweets and blog posts) they would continue with their &#8220;game.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Another woman, who identifies herself as being the first woman on the &#8220;Breakdown of My Lays&#8221; post, has this to say:</p> \n\n<p>To those on the Waking Life list and those who love them,</p> \n\n<p>I vouched for him. For his character, for his business. Like many of us out there, I could not have predicted that my relationship with him would end here.</p> \n\n<p>I was in an awful place when I met him, in the wake an abusive relationship, and he made me feel like he was a safe harbor, someone I could share a bourbon with and vent to. I felt that my physical relationship was separate from my friendship with him&#8211; we had a meaningful platonic connection after our intimate relationship, and it&#8217;s unimaginable to me that he would say these things about someone he considered a friend.</p> \n\n<p>I was shocked that he would write these things about me, when I had given him compassionate advice and comfort in the past, after he confided very personal information to me. I thought of Jared as an equal, someone who suffered like I did- like any person in this world&#8211; and I thought he felt the same about me.</p> \n\n<p>Obviously, everything I believed about him was wrong. And even though I&#8217;m appalled and hurt by his actions, I&#8217;m elated by the response of the Asheville community. After moving from a city where I had few female friends, I feel like I&#8217;m in the world&#8217;s toughest girl gang, part of a group of the ultimate bad bitches. I know you ladies are here for me, and PLEASE know that I have your back, always.</p> \n\n<p>This weekend has been hellish for some of us, but we&#8217;re coming together to make the coming weeks amazing for all of us. I love you all so, so very much&#8211; I love you, Asheville.</p> \n\n<p>Even with their apologies, I think it is fair to say that it is pretty unlikely that either of these fellas is going to be getting laid anytime soon. At least not by any woman capable of using Google.</p> \n\n<p>[ <a href=\"http://ashevilleblog.com/waking-life-espresso-is-under-fire/\" type=\"external\">AshevilleBlog</a>] [ <a href=\"https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2015/09/20/west-asheville-coffee-brewed-outrage/72536502/\" type=\"external\">Citizen-Times</a>] [ <a href=\"https://jaredandjacobsaid.wordpress.com/page/5/\" type=\"external\">Jared And Jacob Said</a>]</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>&amp;#160;</p>", "title": "These Misogynistic Asheville Coffee Shop Owners Will Probably Never Get Laid Again", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://thefrisky.com/2015-09-21/these-asheville-coffee-shop-owners-will-probably-never-get-laid-again/?utm_source%3Dsc-fb%26utm_medium%3Dref%26utm_campaign%3Dmisogynists", "published_at": "2018-10-07", "bias": 4}, {"text": "<p>By Bob Allen</p> \n\n<p>The European Baptist Federation council pledged solidarity with persecuted Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East in a resolution approved at a Sept. 24-27 gathering in Bucharest, Romania.</p> \n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.ebf.org/failid/File/resources/council_resolutions/EBF%20Council%202014%20Resolution%20on%20the%20Middle%20East.pdf\" type=\"external\">resolution</a> &#8220;deplores as evil the aggression and actions of extremist groups and prays for an end to all current violence and hatred throughout the Middle East.&#8221; It says the path to achieving peace and freedom from extremism &#8220;is through justice, development, human rights and rule of law.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>One of the six regions of the Baptist World Alliance, the EBF is comprised of approximately 770,000 Baptists in 52 unions and conventions and seven affiliated churches and networks across Europe and in the Middle East.</p> \n\n<p>The EBF, founded in 1949 to unite European Baptists as Europe emerged from the devastation of World War II, also passed a <a href=\"http://www.ebf.org/failid/File/resources/council_resolutions/EBF%20Council%202014%20Resolution%20World%20War%201%20Centenary%20.pdf\" type=\"external\">resolution</a> recalling &#8220;with sorrow&#8221; the 100th&amp;#160;anniversary of &#8220;the sacrifice, slaughter and human suffering which was a result of the First World War.&#8221; The resolution challenged Baptists in all regions of the world &#8220;to work for peace under the lordship and rule of Jesus Christ.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>The council also adopted a Baptist World Alliance&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.ebf.org/failid/File/resources/council_resolutions/EBF%20Council%202014%20Resolution%20on%20Ukraine%20and%20Russia.pdf\" type=\"external\">resolution</a> adopted in Izmir, Turkey, at its annual gathering in July on the current political crisis in Ukraine.</p> \n\n<p>It encouraged the work of Ukrainian Baptists in reaching out to those most affected by the conflict and urged &#8220;the leaders and churches of the Baptist unions of Ukraine and Russia to overcome prejudice and misunderstanding in the situation, to seek to &#8216;speak the truth in love&#8217; (Ephesians 4:15) to each other, and to continue to work together in partnership toward a common vision of mission and the growth of the Kingdom of God in their region.&#8221;</p>", "title": "European Baptists lament violence in Mid-East, Ukraine", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://baptistnews.com/article/european-baptists-lament-violence/", "published_at": "", "bias": 3}, {"text": "<p>A US businessman may have succeeded in toppling Olmert, as he is the key prosecution witness in the latest corruption case against the Prime Minister.

But many active managers, especially in bond funds, have taken on more risk to boost returns and make up for their higher costs, thus setting themselves up for problems, he said.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;You could actually see them underperform by even more than what you would expect,&#8221; Davis said.</p> \n\n<p>Davis spoke with Reuters just after the company held a rare shareholder meeting for fund investors in Scottsdale, Arizona last week.</p> \n\n<p>For the 12 months ended Sept. 30 its passive funds took in $335 billion, easily beating rivals, according to Morningstar. Another $6.4 billion went into Vanguard&#8217;s own active funds, and its total assets are approaching $5 trillion, the most of any mutual fund firm.</p> \n\n<p>Helping Vanguard and other passive fund managers has been the fact that 88 percent of large-cap active managers underperformed their benchmarks over the five years ending Dec. 31, 2016, according to S&amp;amp;P Jones Indices. Mid-cap and small-cap managers fared even worse.</p> \n\n<p>Passive fund performance generally tracks market indexes. At times both fund types decline in value: In 2008 when the S&amp;amp;P index fell over 38 percent in its worst year ever, actively managed large-cap equity funds on average fell by 38.35 percent, according to Morningstar. Index funds fared little better that year, falling 37.67 percent.</p> \n\n<p>Active proponents still make a case for stock-picking. Benchmarks used by passive funds can overweight risky holdings, favoring active managers in down markets, wrote Morgan Stanley (NYSE:) Wealth Management&#8217;s head of investment and portfolio strategies Lisa Shalett in a paper earlier this year. Faster growth or more volatility could also help.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Active managers may soon have an edge,&#8221; she wrote.</p> \n\n<p>Morningstar found 49 percent of active U.S. stock funds beat their benchmark for the 12 months ended June 30, up from 26 percent for the 12 months ended Dec. 31.</p> \n\n<p>Ben Johnson, a Morningstar research director, said the uptick reflects active managers benefiting from factors like buying high-performing stocks outside their benchmarks, gaining from what he called &#8220;stylistic messiness.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But some active funds have taken on more risk along the way, Johnson said, echoing points made by Vanguard&#8217;s Davis. While about 85 percent of intermediate-term bond funds outperformed for the 12 months ended June 30, Johnson said many did so by holding sub-investment grade credit not present in some index funds. That debt that could be hard to sell in tough times.</p> \n\n<p>It could be a while before an actual economic downturn guides the debate. Davis said it is hard to predict when U.S. economic growth might end and said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t see any catalysts that would cause a recession in the next 12 to 18 months.&#8221;</p>", "title": "Vanguard&apos;s Davis makes case for index funds even in tough times", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://newsline.com/vanguard039s-davis-makes-case-for-index-funds-even-in-tough-times/", "published_at": "2017-11-22", "bias": 1}, {"text": "<p>Published time: 22 Sep, 2017 15:46</p> \n\n<p>Seven bronze busts depicting top Soviet leaders have been added to the Boulevard of Rulers memorial in Moscow that already hosts the portraits of Russian tsars, emperors and empresses as well as legendary founders of the Russian state.</p> \n\n<p>Read more</p> \n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/politics/402473-bill-setting-legal-grounds-for/\" type=\"external\" /></p> \n\n<p>The total number of busts on the Boulevard of Rulers is now 40, all made by Zurab Tsereteli &#8211; the sculptor who also made the towering monument to Peter the Great near the Moskva River.

After the bust of Joseph Stalin was unveiled, one of the women from the audience approached it and unveiled a poster with a poem by 20th century poet Anna Akhmatova in which all advocates of Stalin were called &#8220;sweet lovers of torture,&#8221; and &#8220;experts in orphan-making.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>While monument controversies do not happen very often in Russia, there have been several that were notable. Recently a group of activists who had sought to install a monument to Stalin in the Russian city of Novosibirsk complained to the authorities that a monument to Tsar Nicolas II in the city violates rules on protecting historical sites. Also, earlier this month the government rejected a bill ordering the burial of Vladimir Lenin&#8217;s remains, launched by the nationalist-populist party LDPR. However, the government experts gave a technical reason for their rejection &#8211; they said that the authors of the draft did not mention the sources of funding for the reinternment.</p>", "title": "Stalin, Khrushchev and Gorbachev stand aside on Moscow\u2019s Boulevard of Rulers", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://newsline.com/stalin-khrushchev-and-gorbachev-stand-aside-on-moscows-boulevard-of-rulers/", "published_at": "2017-09-22", "bias": 1}, {"text": "<p>We need to be clear on what is about to happen in the Iraqi city of Falluja, about 64 kilometres west of Baghdad and a key centre of Sunni population in Iraq. This city has for many months held out as a centre of Sunni-based political-military resistance, refusing to accept the authority either of the former US-led occupying authority nor, since July, of the interim Iraqi administration led by the Prime Minister, Iyad Allawi.</p> \n\n<p>Falluja is now to be brought to heel by overwhelming military power. As I write this, the US attack on the city has begun. The message to Falluja from the US armed forces in Iraq and from Allawi was brutally simple: submit now to Baghdad&#8217;s authority or face attack.</p> \n\n<p>It is still possible that resistance in Falluja will melt away in the face of US attack. While this would be a more optimistic scenario, I think it more likely at this point that the insurgents will fight, because too much is at stake politically for them to accept a bloodless Allawi victory. I look here at the&#8211;in my judgement, now more likely&#8211;scenario that Falluja insurgents will dig in and defy the invasion force.</p> \n\n<p>What I believe is then likely to be done to Falluja will be a war crime and crime against humanity, morally indefensible by any civilised standard or for that matter, by the Statute of the International Criminal Court (to which, conveniently, neither the US nor Iraqi Government adheres).</p> \n\n<p>This will be no neat, surgical strike. To get the measure of this, think of the Warsaw rising in 1944, or the Russian Army&#8217;s destruction of the Chechen capital, Grozny. In 1999 this already battered city (of originally 400,000 people) was finally destroyed by massive Russian bombardment. Today, insurgents still fight it out with Russian troops among the ruins.</p> \n\n<p>Eighteen months ago, before the US-led invasion of Iraq, Falluja was a living city of 300,000 people. Now&#8211;depopulated of most of its civilians by intimidation and fear&#8211;what is left looks like it is about to be blasted out of existence, simply as a demonstration of overwhelming US power in Iraq.</p> \n\n<p>Of course, the US Army has been for weeks &#8220;humanely&#8221; encouraging women and children to leave the encircled city through checkpoints while there is still time to save their lives.</p> \n\n<p>The Russians did the same before and during the destruction of Grozny. In a few days, as the battle and the flight of civilians expands, there may be tens of thousands of new refugees in tent cities, and tens of thousands of women left without husbands, and children left without fathers.</p> \n\n<p>If this attack goes ahead as appears inevitable, it will obviously breach the laws of war and the Geneva conventions. First, it will grossly exceed proportionality in terms of ends and means. What intended political or military objective could justify so much death, the creation of so many new refugees, and wholesale destruction of homes?</p> \n\n<p>What threat does the city of Falluja pose to the Iraqi state at this point? Allawi has claimed that free elections cannot take place unless Falluja is subdued. What a spurious argument.</p> \n\n<p>The truth is that this city, which has become a symbol of Sunni-Iraqi political resistance to the occupiers, is to be made an example of, to deter others. The message the siege of Falluja sends is brutally simple: resist us and we will destroy you. It is the same message that the Wehrmacht sent in Warsaw in 1944, and the Russian Army in Grozny in 1999.</p> \n\n<p>This attack will also violate the rules of war and the Geneva conventions in having grossly indiscriminate effects on civilians and civilian homes and infrastructure. America&#8217;s largely untrained in battle but over-armed forces will start their attack &#8220;humanely&#8221;, but as they inevitably take numbers of lethal casualties, their tactics will quickly escalate to indiscriminate bombing and shelling of the city using their WMD armouries.</p> \n\n<p>Eventually, the attackers will flatten the city and kill everyone that still resists in it. Falluja will be the Iraqi people&#8217;s Masada, and it will sow seeds of deep anti-Western hatred in the Middle East for decades to come.</p> \n\n<p>The UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, understands all this, in pleading for a negotiated solution. And as usual, Washington is summarily ignoring his pleas.</p> \n\n<p>As a military ally with our troops in Iraq, Australia is morally implicated in this. While Australian former SAS commanders, the Governor-General, Major-General Michael Jeffery, and the Australian Christian Lobby&#8217;s executive chairman, Brigadier Jim Wallace, moralise about abortions and gay marriages, Australia&#8217;s military ally is about to destroy a living city and its families.</p> \n\n<p>An unnamed US military commander in the tightening military ring around Falluja proudly boasted (as heard on ABC Radio yesterday) that this battle will go down in US military history as another Hue. Indeed it will&#8211;who can forget the wholesale artillery destruction of that sacred, historic Vietnamese city? &#8220;We had to destroy it in order to save it&#8221; was the line at the time. Now it looks like our military ally in Iraq is about to do it all over again in Falluja.</p> \n\n<p>What are Australian political leaders&#8211;Government or Opposition&#8211;saying to Washington at this point? Are they saying anything at all?

Taha Taher al-Ani.</p> \n\n<p>Omran didn&#8217;t see al-Ani again until years later, in 2003. The Americans had invaded Iraq and were storming toward Baghdad. Saddam Hussein&#8217;s fall was imminent.</p> \n\n<p>At a sprawling military base north of the capital, al-Ani was directing the loading of weapons, ammunition and ordnance into trucks to spirit away. He took those weapons with him when he joined Tawhid wa&#8217;l-Jihad, a forerunner of al-Qaida&#8217;s branch in Iraq.</p> \n\n<p>Now al-Ani is a commander in the Islamic State group, said Omran, who rose to become a major general in the Iraqi army and now commands its 5th Division fighting IS.</p> \n\n<p>He kept track of his former comrade through Iraq&#8217;s tribal networks and intelligence gathered by the government&#8217;s main counter terrorism service, of which he is a member.</p> \n\n<p>They have been put in charge of intelligence-gathering, spying on the Iraqi forces as well as maintaining and upgrading weapons and trying to develop a chemical weapons program.</p> \n\n<p>Patrick Skinner, a former CIA case officer who has served in Iraq, said Saddam-era military and intelligence officers were a &#8216;necessary ingredient&#8217; in the Islamic State group&#8217;s stunning battlefield successes last year, accounting for its transformation from a &#8216;terrorist organization to a proto-state.&#8217;</p> \n\n<p>&#8216;Their military successes last year were not terrorist, they were military successes,&#8217; said Skinner, now director of special projects for The Soufan Group, a private strategic intelligence services firm.</p> \n\n<p>The group&#8217;s second-in-command, al-Baghdadi&#8217;s deputy, is a former Saddam-era army major, Saud Mohsen Hassan, known by the pseudonyms Abu Mutazz and Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, according to the intelligence chief.</p> \n\n<p>Hassan also goes by Fadel al-Hayali, a fake name he used before the fall of Saddam, the intelligence chief, who spoke under the condition of anonymity to The Associated Press.</p> \n\n<p>During the 2000s, Hassan was imprisoned in the notorious U.S.-run Bucca prison camp, the main detention center for members of the Sunni insurgency, where al-Baghdadi also was held.</p> \n\n<p>The prison was a significant incubator for the Islamic State group, bringing militants like al-Baghdadi into contact with former Saddam officers, including members of special forces, the elite Republican Guard and the paramilitary force called Fedayeen.</p> \n\n<p>In Bucca&#8217;s Ward 6, al-Baghdadi gave sermons and Hassan emerged as an effective organizer, leading strikes by the prisoners to gain concessions from their American jailers, the intelligence chief said.</p> \n\n<p>Former Bucca prisoners are now throughout the IS leadership. Among them is Abu Alaa al-Afari, a veteran Iraqi militant who was once with al-Qaida and now serves as the head of IS&#8217;s &#8216;Beit al-Mal,&#8217; or treasury, according to a chart of what is believed to be the group&#8217;s hierarchy provided to the AP by the intelligence chief.</p> \n\n<p>Al-Baghdadi has drawn these trusted comrades even closer after he was wounded in an airstrike earlier this year, the intelligence chief said.</p> \n\n<p>He has appointed a number of them to the group&#8217;s Military Council, believed to have seven to nine members &#8211; at least four of whom are former Saddam officers. He brought other former Bucca inmates into his inner circle and personal security.</p> \n\n<p>Saddam-era veterans also serve as &#8216;governors&#8217; for seven of the 12 &#8216;provinces&#8217; set up by the Islamic State group in the territory it holds in Iraq, the intelligence chief said.</p> \n\n<p>Iraqi officials acknowledge that identifying IS leadership is an uncertain task.

People tend to sell at the same time, but they buy in at staggered times,&#8221; said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S&amp;amp;P Capital IQ.</p> \n\n<p>Since bottoming out at 6547 on March 9, 2009, the Dow Industrials have ripped off nearly 10,000 points as the collapse of the financial system was averted and economic growth eventually returned.</p> \n\n<p>A bull market is typically defined as an advance of 20% after a decline of 20% or more that lasts a minimum of six months. Through Thursday&#8217;s close, the S&amp;amp;P 500 has surged 181% since bottoming at the scary level of 666 in March 2009.</p> \n\n<p>Advertisement</p> \n\n<p>Strong Market, Mediocre Economy</p> \n\n<p>According to Capital IQ, of the six bull markets since World War II that lived to celebrate their fifth birthday, the current run is second only to the incredible 225% advance that began in 1982. The next closest bull market performance through five years was the 111% rally for the streak that began in 1949.</p> \n\n<p>Impressively, the current market also took just five years to get back to breakeven, compared with the 25 years before stocks recovered from the Great Crash of &#8217;29.</p> \n\n<p>\"The big story about the five-year anniversary is all of the investors who haven&#8217;t participated because they were scarred by 2008.\"</p> \n\n<p>The tremendous advance on Wall Street has been fueled by the return of economic growth, albeit at a slower pace than desirable, and incredibly easy money policies from the Federal Reserve.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;This whole cycle has been notable for its anemic fundamental gains, but sharp price rebound,&#8221; said Bruce McCain, who helps oversee more than $20 billion as chief investment strategist at KeyCorp&#8217;s (NYSE:KEY) Key Private Bank.</p> \n\n<p>Job growth has returned, though not as strong as hoped for. Profits have surged, but a large chunk is attributed to cost cutting. U.S. companies are struggling to grow revenues organically and remain reluctant to reinvest profits in job-creating projects.</p> \n\n<p>Shattered Confidence Hurts Participation</p> \n\n<p>Despite the duration of the bull market, it&#8217;s clear the battle scars of 2007-2009 have not healed.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;It was brutally painful. On a purely gut level, it was terrifying,&#8221; said Peter Kenny, co-chairman and CEO of financial technology firm The Clearpool Group who correctly called the market bottom in March 2009.</p> \n\n<p>Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors, said: &#8220;We had seen institutions crumble. There was this incredible tension in the marketplace and a lack of confidence that investors hadn&#8217;t seen in decades.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Much of that mood has persisted for years. The big story about the five-year anniversary is all of the investors who haven&#8217;t participated because they were scarred by 2008,&#8221; she said.</p> \n\n<p>Just two months ago, Wall Street was buzzing about how 2014 looked like a repeat of 1929. Those fears and subsequent pullback (5% or more decline) were driven by concerns about emerging markets like <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">China</a> and <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Argentina</a>, but they were underpinned by the memories of 2008.</p> \n\n<p>Panicked <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">investors yanked $6.4 billion from emerging-market stock funds</a> in a single week, the most in almost three years.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Whenever there are tremors in the market there have been significant flows out of them as well,&#8221; said Hooper.</p> \n\n<p>No Melt Up...Yet</p> \n\n<p>Those investors who were understandably spooked ended up missing out on a rebound on Wall Street that carried stocks to fresh all-time highs just weeks later.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;Investors aren&#8217;t willing to move in and stay in. Treat this as a permanent allocation or you will miss out on some of the best moves in the market. You have to be in it all the time,&#8221; said Hooper.</p> \n\n<p>Of course, if retail investors had gone all in, the current bull market likely would have died already.</p> \n\n<p>That&#8217;s because valuations would have gotten ahead of the so-so fundamentals, causing a melt up followed by a meltdown.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;There is this sense that we&#8217;ve all learned a lesson we don&#8217;t ever want to forget. It is precisely because of that sense of caution that the market has continued to find room to move higher,&#8221; said Kenny.</p> \n\n<p>Sixth Birthday Ahead?</p> \n\n<p>The question is whether it&#8217;s too late for investors to jump back into equities five years into the bull run.</p> \n\n<p>Stovall said that while 85% of the bull markets that celebrated their fourth birthdays went on to see their fifth, only 60% of those that lasted five years celebrated their sixth birthday.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;The sixth birthday becomes a little bit more challenging. Everybody has to meet their maker one of these days,&#8221; he said.</p> \n\n<p>Still, Stovall said he believes equities have a &#8220;good chance&#8221; of extending their run another year, but warns the price gain will likely be more &#8220;subdued&#8221; than the average surge of 26% in all sixth years since World War II.</p> \n\n<p>For another year of green, he said the U.S. economy must accelerate to 3% by the end of 2014, earnings growth needs to stay on track and valuations need to stay within historic norms.</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, I do think retail investors will come back, but they will never forget what happened to them, their future and their hard earned money in that market rout that ended five years ago,&#8221; said Kenny.</p>", "title": "Crisis Scars Linger Even as Bull Market Turns Five", "hyperpartisan": true, "url": "http://foxbusiness.com/markets/2014/03/07/crisis-scars-linger-even-as-bull-market-turns-5.html", "published_at": "2016-03-06", "bias": 0}, {"text": "<p>Growth in U.S. consumer credit cooled in September as households appeared to use their credit cards more sparingly, Federal Reserve data showed on Wednesday.</p> \n\n<p>Consumer credit grew $11.36 billion in September, just above the median forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.

He came out, publically.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Wainaina is one of the most high-profile Africans to do that, let alone Kenyans.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Author <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevmwachiro\" type=\"external\">Kevin Mwachiro</a> says it's a big moment for the country and continent. Mwachiro is a former BBC journalist who wrote the new book, \"Invisible: Stories from Kenya's Queer Community.\"&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>\"I think Africa's gay community needed a good story,\" he says. \"And Binyavanga's coming out was the good story that we needed. He's been challenging a lot of misconceptions about the gay community. He took the discussion, the perception, to another level.\"</p> \n\n<p>Mwachiro, in his own way, is doing the same with his book.&amp;#160;It tells the stories of LGBT Kenyans from all walks of life. So there are rural stories and urban stories, with Christians and Muslims, men and women, and transsexuals. Everyone.&amp;#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s not just black Kenyans,&#8221; he says.</p> \n\n<p>One example is a woman named Barbara. Her story moved Mwachiro to tears. He says Barbara was born male and made the transition to female.&amp;#160;</p> \n\n<p>Back in primary school, she was bullied and raped. The only saving grace for her was a Google search: \"boy who feels like a girl.\" That one small search allowed Barbara to know what she was going through and that there was a name for it. In that moment, she made the decision to transition to female after high school.</p> \n\n<p>\"She was going to transition into being her true self,\" he says.</p> \n\n<p>Early reviews for the book are positive. Here&#8217;s one response by Faith Oneya for the Kenyan literary website, <a href=\"http://www.wamathai.com/\" type=\"external\">Wamathai</a>:</p> \n\n<p>&#8220;If there is anything that the collection does well, then it is to compel the reader ... to look at the roots of our prejudices against queer people in Kenya,\" Oneya writes, \"and to consider our actions &#8212; that one time in boarding school, or while playing a dad and mum game, that kid who everyone said was a tomboy, or too much of a girl &#8212; because that is when, for most of the authors, that who they were started dawning on them.&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>But that review, in many ways, comes from the choir. The real question is whether Mwachiro's book is getting to people who need convincing in Africa?</p> \n\n<p>Mwachiro says yes, and that his book is one more addition that is helping change the way Kenyans talk about LGBT issues. The book is getting press in the mainstream, local media. The author illustrates the impact in a simple moment he just had,&amp;#160;when he appeared on a local radio show. The radio host put out the question to listeners, &#8220;Is the gay community in Kenya being discriminated against?&#8221;</p> \n\n<p>Nothing much, right?&amp;#160;But, for Mwachiro, it was a big shift in the conversation. Before, he says, a common question being asked was, are there any gay people in Kenya?</p> \n\n<p>So it&#8217;s progress, step by step.</p> \n\n<p>And steps remain. His publisher is based in Germany. And while there are a couple small presses in Kenya that would publish such a book, Mwachiro thinks most big publishers would steer clear of the topic.</p> \n\n<p>He expects that to change, too. Mwachiro says Kenya has a vibrant gay scene, albeit underground. And it&#8217;s one that will continue to surface, as each story continues to move beyond the gay community in Kenya out toward the far corners of the country.</p>", "title": "Kenya's gay community comes out, one story at a time", "hyperpartisan": false, "url": "https://pri.org/stories/2014-02-17/kenyas-gay-community-comes-out-one-story-time", "published_at": "2014-02-17", "bias": 3}, {"text": "<p>Kim Kardashian, the most famous woman in the world for doing nothing, was accused of actually doing something this week, forgetting her one-year-old baby daughter, North West, in a hotel lobby.
